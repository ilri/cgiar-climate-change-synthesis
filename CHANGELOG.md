# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Normalize countries to common short names instead of official names, drop unmatched countries, and de-duplicate list
- Remove "climate change" keyword since it is implied that all journal articles are climate change related and it congests tag clouds and topic lists
- Normalize publishers
- Use `pandas_convert` in for country, region, and continent operations for a massive speed up

### Added

- Add column with UN regions (based on countries)
- Add column continents (based on countries)
- Retrieve missing publishers from Crossref
- Add column indicating original research (as opposed to review, synthesis, opinion, etc)
- Retrieve missing affiliations from OpenAlex (these are very messy currently, only normalizing CGIAR centers for now)
- Extract missing countries from titles and abstracts (best effort, still many missing)
