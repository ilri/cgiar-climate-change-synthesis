A decentralized approach to model national and global food and land use systems,"Mosnier, Aline; Javalera-Rincon, Valeria; Jones, Sarah K.; Andrew, Robbie; Bai, Zhaohai; Baker, Justin; Basnet, Shyam; Singh, Vartika","The achievement of several sustainable development goals and the Paris Climate Agreement depends on rapid progress towards sustainable food and land systems in all countries. We have built a flexible, collaborative modeling framework to foster the development of national pathways by local research teams and their integration up to global scale. Local researchers independently customize national models to explore mid-century pathways of the food and land use system transformation in collaboration with stakeholders. An online platform connects the national models, iteratively balances global exports and imports, and aggregates results to the global level. Our results show that actions toward greater sustainability in countries could sum up to 1 Mha net forest gain per year, 950 Mha net gain in the land where natural processes predominate, and an increased CO2 sink of 3.7 GtCO2e yr−1 over the period 2020–2050 compared to current trends, while average food consumption per capita remains above the adequate food requirements in all countries. We show examples of how the global linkage impacts national results and how different assumptions in national pathways impact global results. This modeling setup acknowledges the broad heterogeneity of socio-ecological contexts and the fact that people who live in these different contexts should be empowered to design the future they want. But it also demonstrates to local decision-makers the interconnectedness of our food and land use system and the urgent need for more collaboration to converge local and global priorities.",Norway's International Climate and Forest Initiative; MAVA Foundation; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation,English,10.1088/1748-9326/acc044,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8644,2023,Environmental Research Letters,1748-9326,IOP Publishing Ltd.,Environmental Research Letters 18(4): 045001,agriculture; climate change; sustainable agriculture; food systems; global warming; greenhouse gases; land; research methods; socioeconomic development; stakeholders; sustainable development goals,Journal article

A knowledge brokering framework for integrated landscape management,"McGonigle, Daniel F.; Rota Nodari, Giulia; Phillips, Robyn L.; Aynekulu, Ermias; Estrada-Carmona, Natalia; Zhang, Wei","Sustainable land management is at the heart of some of the most intractable challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. It is critical for tackling biodiversity loss, land degradation, climate change and the decline of ecosystem services. It underpins food production, livelihoods, dietary health, social equity, climate change adaptation, and many other outcomes. However, interdependencies, trade-offs, time lags, and non-linear responses make it difficult to predict the combined effects of land management decisions. Policy decisions also have to be made in the context of conflicting interests, values and power dynamics of those living on the land and those affected by the consequences of land use decisions. This makes designing and coordinating effective land management policies and programmes highly challenging. The difficulty is exacerbated by the scarcity of reliable data on the impacts of land management on the environment and livelihoods. This poses a challenge for policymakers and practitioners in governments, development banks, non-governmental organisations, and other institutions. It also sets demands for researchers, who are under ever increasing pressure from funders to demonstrate uptake and impact of their work. Relatively few research methods exist that can address such questions in a holistic way. Decision makers and researchers need to work together to help untangle, contextualise and interpret fragmented evidence through systems approaches to make decisions in spite of uncertainty. Individuals and institutions acting as knowledge brokers can support these interactions by facilitating the co-creation and use of scientific and other knowledge. Given the patchy nature of data and evidence, particularly in developing countries, it is important to draw on the full range of available models, tools and evidence. In this paper we review the use of evidence to inform multiple-objective integrated landscape management policies and programmes, focusing on how to simultaneously achieve different sustainable development objectives in diverse landscapes. We set out key success factors for evidence-based decision-making, which are summarised into 10 key principles for integrated landscape management knowledge brokering in integrated landscape management and 12 key skills for knowledge brokers. We finally propose a decision-support framework to organise evidence that can be used to tackle different types of land management policy decision.",UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,English,10.3389/fsufs.2020.00013,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7123,2020,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,2571-581X,,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems 4:13,landscape conservation; water; decision making; knowledge; climate change; ecosystems; integrated land management; policies; knowledge brokering framework; landscape-scale policy,Journal article

A novel seasonal-spatial integrated model for improving the economic-environmental performance of crop production,"Li, Man; Guo, Zhe; Zhang, Wei","Excess agricultural nitrogen, mainly from manure and chemical fertilizers, is a primary source of nutrient pollution and presents serious environmental threats to natural ecosystems and human health. Improvements in nitrogen-use efficiency in crop production are critical for addressing the triple challenge of food insecurity, environmental degradation, and climate change. Approaches such as sustainable intensification that stress technological innovations have received the most attention. But science-based cropland use planning, a promising complementary approach, has so far been largely overlooked. Here we develop a spatially integrated economic-ecological modeling method to assess this previously unexplored potential for improving the economic-environmental performance of crop production by examining the seasonal and spatial implications of cropland and fertilizer use in Bangladesh. In doing so, we aim to make the modeling method accessible to researchers and practitioners interested in achieving the dual goal of food production and environmental sustainability for countries that are characterized by seasonal and spatial variations in crop mix and cropping practices.",National Aeronautics and Space Administration; George Mason University; Utah State University; U.S. Department of Agriculture,English,10.1016/j.mex.2022.101906,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8435,2022,MethodsX,2215-0161,Elsevier,MethodsX 9(2022): 101906,agriculture; nitrogen; organic fertilizers; chemical fertilizer; pollution; environment; ecosystems; human health; crop production; food insecurity; environmental degradation; climate change; sustainable intensification; technological innovation; modeling,Journal article

A review of types of risks in agriculture: What we know and what we need to know,"Komarek, Adam M.; De Pinto, Alessandro; Smith, Vincent H.","This study examines the scope and depth of research on the five major types of risks in agriculture, and the extent to which those studies have addressed the impacts of, and policies to mitigate individual types of risk as opposed to more holistic analyses of the multiple sources of risk with which farmers have to cope with. Risk is at the center of new paradigms and approaches that inform risk management initiatives and shape investments in many countries. Although the literature includes several substantive reviews of the methods available for risk analysis and their empirical applications have been extensively scrutinized, limited information exists about which types of risks have received sufficient attention, and which have not. This limited information is perplexing because farmers manage multiple risks at the same time and unanticipated events continue to have substantial impacts on farmers. We identify 3283 peer-reviewed studies that address one or more of the five major types of risk in agriculture (production risk, market risk, institutional risk, personal risk, and financial risk) published between 1974 and 2019. We conduct a literature search and then apply an eligibility criteria to retain eligible studies from the search. We then classify those eligible studies based on risk type and geographic focus. We placed no limit on the temporal scale, geographic focus, or study method for inclusion in our search. Results show that 66% of the 3283 studies focused solely on production risk, with only 15% considering more than one type of risk. Only 18 studies considered all five types of risk and those either asked how farmers perceived the importance of each risk or were focused on conceptual issues, rather than assessing how exposure to all the risks quantitatively affects farm indicators such as yields or incomes. Without more detailed analyses of the multiple types of risks faced by farmers, farmers and policymakers will lack the information needed to devise relevant risk management strategies and policies. A shift in research focus towards the analysis of multiple contemporaneous types of risk may provide a basis that gives farmers greater options for coping with and managing risk. We discuss some of the challenges for studying multiple risks simultaneously, including data requirements and the need for probability distributions and the role of simulation approaches.",United States Agency for International Development USAID,English,10.1016/j.agsy.2019.102738,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6929,2020,Agricultural Systems,0308-521X,Elsevier,Agricultural Systems 178(February 2020): 102738,agriculture; risk; farms; households; farmers; reviews; risk management; risk analysis; agricultural production; food prices; climate change; agricultural risk; production risk; climate risk,Journal article

Addressing gender in agricultural research for development in the face of a changing climate: where are we and where should we be going?,"Kristjanson, Patricia; Bryan, Elizabeth; Bernier, Quinn; Twyman, Jennifer; Meinzen-Dick, Ruth Suseela; Kieran, Caitlin; Ringler, Claudia; Jost, Christine; Doss, Cheryl","Agricultural development efforts that do not address persistent gender gaps miss opportunities for greater impact. This synthesis reflects on key findings from integrated quantitative and qualitative analyses at the nexus of gender, agricultural development, and climate change. Linked farm household-, intrahousehold-, community-, and institutional-level data highlight significant and nuanced gender differences in adaptive capacity of individuals and communities to respond to climate change. The gender gap is also substantial in exposure to climate change and its impacts, and uptake of new practices that lower vulnerability. Women in agriculture will remain largely neglected by information and service providers unless their differing needs, access to, and control over resources are considered at policy and project design stage. Yet clear guidelines for addressing the needs of both men and women in different environments and agricultural systems are still lacking. Participatory ‘action research’ approaches with a focus on co-learning, and using innovative cell phone or social media-based approaches offer exciting new opportunities. Agricultural development decision-makers and project designers need to ‘design with gender in mind’. Equipping them with tools and knowledge of innovative gender-transformative practices and intervention options and creating accountability for serving women and men will be key.",,English,10.1080/14735903.2017.1336411,Open Access,,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/5855,2017,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,,,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability 15(5): 482-500,agricultural development; climate change; resilience; gender inequity; gender; adaptive capacity; vulnerability,Journal article

Agricultural development and land‐use change in India: A scenario analysis of trade‐offs between UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),"Hinz, Roman; Sulser, Timothy B.; Huefner, R.; Mason-D'Croz, Daniel; Dunston, Shahnila; Ringler, Claudia","India has the second largest population in the world and is characterized by a broad diversity in climate, topography, flora, fauna, land‐use, and socioeconomic conditions. To help ensure food security in the future, agricultural systems will have to respond to global change drivers such as population growth, changing dietary habits, and climate change. However, alterations of how food is produced in the future may conflict with other UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as the protection of land resources and climate change mitigation. It is crucial for decision‐makers to understand potential trade‐offs between these goals to find a balance of human needs and environmental impacts. In this paper, we analyze pathways of agricultural productivity, land‐use, and land‐cover changes in India until 2030 and their impacts on terrestrial biodiversity and carbon storage. The results show that in order to meet future food production demands, agricultural lands are likely to expand and existing farmlands need to be intensified. However, both processes will result in biodiversity losses. At the same time, the projections reveal carbon stock increases due to intensification processes and decreases due to conversions of natural land into agriculture. On balance, we find that carbon stocks increase with the scenarios of future agricultural productivity as modeled here. In conclusion, we regard further agricultural intensification as a crucial element to help ensure food security and to slow down the expansion of cropland and pasture. At the same time, policies are required to implement this intensification in a way that minimizes biodiversity losses.",International Center for Development and Decent Work (ICDD); Centre for Ecological Economics and Natural Resources (CEENR); Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC); United States Agency for International Development USAID; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,English,10.1029/2019ef001287,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7047,2020,Earth's Future,2328-4277,American Geophysical Union (AGU),Earth's Future 8(2): e2019EF001287,agricultural development; agriculture; land use change; land use; sustainable development goals; food security; food production; goal 12 responsible production and consumption; climate change; climate change mitigation; agricultural productivity; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; impact model; landshift model,Journal article
Agricultural growth and sex-disaggregated employment in Africa: Future perspectives under different investment scenarios,"Frija, Aymen; Chebil, Ali; Mottaleb, Khondoker Abdul; Mason-D'Croz, Daniel; Dhehibi, Boubaker","Literature is scanty on how public agricultural investments can help reducing the impact of future challenges such as climate change and population pressure on national economies. The objective of this study is to assess the medium and long-term effects of alternative agricultural research and development investment scenarios on male and female employment in 14 African countries. We first estimate the effects of agricultural investment scenarios on the overall GDP growth of a given country using partial and general equilibrium models. Secondly, using employment elasticities to GDP growth, we estimate the impact of GDP growth on overall employment in the economy. Results show that, increased investments in agriculture could generate higher overall employment and reduce gender disparities in labor participation. In 8 out of 14 sampled countries, female employment increased more than male employment in response to agricultural investments.

Agricultural investments and hunger in Africa modeling potential contributions to SDG2 – Zero Hunger,"Mason-D'Croz, Daniel; Sulser, Timothy B.; Wiebe, Keith D.; Rosegrant, Mark W.; Lowder, Sarah K.; Nin-Pratt, Alejandro; Willenbockel, Dirk; Robinson, Sherman; Zhu, Tingju; Cenacchi, Nicola; Dunston, Shahnila; Robertson, Richard D.","We use IFPRI’s IMPACT framework of linked biophysical and structural economic models to examine developments in global agricultural production systems, climate change, and food security. Building on related work on how increased investment in agricultural research, resource management, and infrastructure can address the challenges of meeting future food demand, we explore the costs and implications of these investments for reducing hunger in Africa by 2030. This analysis is coupled with a new investment estimation model, based on the perpetual inventory methodology (PIM), which allows for a better assessment of the costs of achieving projected agricultural improvements. We find that climate change will continue to slow projected reductions in hunger in the coming decades—increasing the number of people at risk of hunger in 2030 by 16 million in Africa compared to a scenario without climate change. Investments to increase agricultural productivity can offset the adverse impacts of climate change and help reduce the share of people at risk of hunger in 2030 to five percent or less in Northern, Western, and Southern Africa, but the share is projected to remain at ten percent or more in Eastern and Central Africa. Investments in Africa to achieve these results are estimated to cost about 15 billion USD per year between 2015 and 2030, as part of a larger package of investments costing around 52 billion USD in developing countries.",United States Agency for International Development USAID; United Nations; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,English,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.12.006,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6539,2019,World Development,0305-750X,,World Development 116(April 2019): 38-53,commodities; trade; food supply; food security; climate change; technological changes; commodity markets; resource management; economic development; prices; nutrition; malnutrition; sustainable development goals; hunger; investment; impact model,Journal article

Agricultural subsidies and global greenhouse gas emissions,"Laborde Debucquet, David; Mamun, Abdullah; Martin, Will; Piñeiro, Valeria; Vos, Rob","Agricultural production is strongly affected by and a major contributor to climate change. Agriculture and land-use change account for a quarter of total global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). Agriculture receives around US$600 billion per year worldwide in government support. No rigorous quantification of the impact of this support on GHG emissions has been available. This article helps fill the void. Here, we find that, while over the years the government support has incentivized the development of high-emission farming systems, at present, the support only has a small impact in terms of inducing additional global GHG emissions from agricultural production; partly because support is not systematically biased towards high-emission products, and partly because support generated by trade protection reduces demand for some high-emission products by raising their consumer prices. Substantially reducing GHG emissions from agriculture while safeguarding food security requires a more comprehensive revamping of existing support to agriculture and food consumption.",World Bank Group,English,10.1038/s41467-021-22703-1,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7760,2021,Nature Communications,2041-1723,Nature Publishing Group,Nature Communications 12: 2601,subsidies; agriculture; greenhouse gas emissions; models; climate change; agricultural production; trade; agricultural subsidies; miragrodep; computable general equilibrium (cge) model,Journal article
Agricultural water allocation under uncertainty: Redistribution of water shortage risk," Li, Man; Xu, Wenchao; Zhu, Tingju ","This article develops an economic model to analyze how the risk of water shortages affects farmers’ land irrigation decision and how the priority-based water sharing arrangement redistributes such a risk among farms with different water rights priorities. The analysis brings together an array of comprehensive data files on irrigation rights, water supplies, and agricultural land use from eastern Idaho. Results indicate that a more left-skewed distribution of streamflow significantly discourages land irrigation among farmers except the most senior rights holders. The priority-based water sharing arrangement redistributes the macroscale risk of water shortages and thus exposes farmers of different water rights priorities to heterogeneous levels of risk: senior water rights holders are affected the least and such a risk is instead passed mostly on to junior water rights holders. The role of water rights in risk redistribution is more significant when the probability distribution of water shortage risk is asymmetric rather than symmetric. The historical development pattern of water rights influences how the priority of water rights takes effect on land irrigation decision.",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Aeronautics and Space Administration,English,10.1093/ajae/aay058,Open Access,,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6336,2018,American Journal of Agricultural Economics,,Oxford University Press,American Journal of Agricultural Economics 101(1): 134–153,irrigation systems; water availability; water supply; groundwater; climate change; water rights; water management; irrigated farming; agricultural policies; land irrigation; water shortage; risk redistribution,Journal article

Aspirations and the role of social protection: evidence from a natural disaster in rural Pakistan,"Kosec, Katrina; Mo, Cecilia Hyunjung","Citizens’ aspirations are increasingly recognized as an important dimension of their well-being. Those with high aspirations set ambitious goals for themselves, and those with low aspirations may fall prey to a poverty trap. Do natural disasters negatively impact aspirations? If so, can governments blunt these effects? We consider Pakistan’s devastating 2010 floods—and the government’s uneven relief efforts—to analyze these questions. We first show that the extreme rainfall generating this disaster significantly reduced aspirations, even when current levels of household expenditure, wealth, and education are taken into account. Individuals experiencing 2010 monsoon season rainfall that was one standard deviation higher than average had aspiration levels 1.5 years later that were 0.15 standard deviations lower than those of similar individuals experiencing just average levels of rainfall. This is the same negative shock to aspirations that one would experience as a result of a 50% reduction in household expenditures. Moreover, the negative effect of natural disasters on aspirations is especially strong among the poor, and among those who are most vulnerable to weather shocks. However, exploiting exogenous variation in flood relief access, we show that government social protection can attenuate these negative impacts. Individuals in villages that received Citizens Damage Compensation (Watan Card) Program flood relief—providing cash equivalent to 9.4% of annual household expenditures in each of the three years following the disaster—saw significantly lower declines in aspirations than did those in similarly affected villages without this relief. This offers a new understanding of social protection; it not only restores livelihoods and replaces damaged assets, but also has an enduring effect by easing mental burdens, and thus raising aspirations for the future. The negative effects of natural disasters and the efficacy of government relief programs may thus be underestimated if aspirations are ignored.",United States Agency for International Development USAID,English,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.03.039,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/5793,2017,World Development,,Elsevier,World Development 97(September 2017): 49-66,climate change; psychology; natural disasters; flooding; state capacity; political economy of development; social protection; aspirations,Journal article

Assessing population exposure to coastal flooding due to sea level rise,"Hauer, Mathew E.; Hardy, Dean; Kulp, Scott A.; Mueller, Valerie; Wrathall, David J.; Clark, Peter U.","The exposure of populations to sea-level rise (SLR) is a leading indicator assessing the impact of future climate change on coastal regions. SLR exposes coastal populations to a spectrum of impacts with broad spatial and temporal heterogeneity, but exposure assessments often narrowly define the spatial zone of flooding. Here we show how choice of zone results in differential exposure estimates across space and time. Further, we apply a spatio-temporal flood-modeling approach that integrates across these spatial zones to assess the annual probability of population exposure. We apply our model to the coastal United States to demonstrate a more robust assessment of population exposure to flooding from SLR in any given year. Our results suggest that more explicit decisions regarding spatial zone (and associated temporal implication) will improve adaptation planning and policies by indicating the relative chance and magnitude of coastal populations to be affected by future SLR.",National Science Foundation,English,10.1038/s41467-021-27260-1,Open Access,,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8046,2021,Nature Communications,2041-1723,Nature Publishing Group,Nature Communications 12: 6900,population; assessment; coastal climate; flooding; sea level; climate change,Journal article
Assessing residue and tillage management options for carbon sequestration in future climate change scenarios,"Aditi, Kumari; Abbhishek, Kumar; Chander, Girish; Singh, Ajay; Falk, Thomas; Mequanint, Melesse B.; Cuba, Perumal; Anupama, G.; Mandpati, Roja; Nagaraji, Satish","Soil carbon depletion is a major concern for food security in drylands. The objective of this study is to test tillage with residue management under sequential and intercropping systems for carbon sequestration in semi-arid tropical drylands of India. We report the findings from a long-term field experiment (9 years) used to simulate the effect of residue and tillage management in Maize-chickpea sequential and Maize-Pigeonpea intercropping systems for the four possible future climate projections using APSIM model. These findings demonstrate a sustainable route with inclusive growth, as pledged at the UN climate change summit. A comparison of results under SSP 2.6 and 4.5 Wm−2 with SSP 8.5 shows that demand pressure from competitive marketplaces inhibits the establishment of soil carbon sinks and significantly reduces crop yields, likely due to indiscriminate chemical fertilizer use. We observed that a better decision in selecting cropping system might improve soil organic carbon content (SOC). SOC content ranging from 0.9 to 1.2% in Maize-pigeonpea intercropping and 0.85–1.1% in maize-chickpea sequential cropping systems, demonstrate good potential in the climate change mitigation exertions. Early SOC saturation (20 years) led to a decreased carbon stock in topsoil without residue addition practises. The addition of crop residues significantly increased SOC levels under both conventional and minimum tillage and created additional income for farmers. Simulation analysis showed impact of SOC changes on crop yield which remained nearly stable for 85 years. Therefore, hardy straw biomass of crops covering a large tract in dryland tropics, can be a scalable and sustainable solution to yield losses, while mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration.",Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GIZ,English,10.1016/j.crsust.2023.100210,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8619,2023,Current Research in Environmental Sustainability,2666-0490,Elsevier,Current Research in Environmental Sustainability 5(2023): 100210,soil; carbon; food security; intercropping; carbon sequestration; tillage; maize; chickpeas; pigeonpea; climate change adaptation; climate change; sustainability; crop yield; fertilizers; cropping systems; natural resouces management; natural resources; dry lands; crop residues; modeling; soil organic carbon; climate prediction; apsim model,Journal article
Assessing the future global distribution of land ecosystems as determined by climate change and cropland incursion,"Robertson, Richard D.; De Pinto, Alessandro; Cenacchi, Nicola","The geographic distribution of natural ecosystems is afected by both climate and cropland. Discussions of future land use/land cover usually focus on how cropland expands and displaces natural vegetation especially as climate change impacts become stronger. Less commonly considered is the direct infuence of climate change on natural ecosystems simultaneously with cropland incursion. We combine a natural vegetation model responsive to climate with a cropland allocation algorithm to assess the relative importance of climate change compared to cropland incursion. Globally, the model indicates that climate change drives larger gains and losses than cropland incursion. For example, in the Amazonian rainforests, more than one sixth of the forest area could be lost due to climate change with cropland playing virtually no role. Our fndings suggest that policies to protect specifc ecosystems may be undercut by climate change and that localized analyses that fully account for the impacts of a changing climate on natural vegetation and agriculture are necessary to formulate policies that preserve natural ecosystems over the long term.

We use a gendered computable general equilibrium model linked with microsimulations to assess the distributive effects of climate change in Bolivia. Two scenarios are evaluated. The first scenario addresses capital and land damages, while the second analyses the decrease in agricultural production yields. We find that both scenarios have negative impacts on the Bolivian economy. The scenarios drive down employment and increase the burden of domestic work, especially for women. Furthermore, both simulations reveal negative impacts on poverty, with women in rural areas being the most affected.",,English,10.1002/jid.3711,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8783,2023,Journal of International Development,0954-1748,John Wiley & Sons,Journal of International Development 35(5): 669-960,"agricultural production; climate change; computable general equilibrium models; domestic work; gender; models; men; poverty; rural areas; women; yields

Balancing national economic policy outcomes for sustainable development,"Basheer, Mohammed; Nechifor, Victor; Calzadilla, Alvaro; Ringler, Claudia; Hulme, David; Harou, Julien J.","The 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim at jointly improving economic, social, and environmental outcomes for human prosperity and planetary health. However, designing national economic policies that support advancement across multiple Sustainable Development Goals is hindered by the complexities of multi-sector economies and often conflicting policies. To address this, we introduce a national-scale design framework that can enable policymakers to sift through complex, non-linear, multi-sector policy spaces to identify efficient policy portfolios that balance economic, social, and environmental goals. The framework combines economy-wide sustainability simulation and artificial intelligence-driven multiobjective, multi-SDG policy search and machine learning. The framework can support multi-sector, multi-actor policy deliberation to screen efficient policy portfolios. We demonstrate the utility of the framework for a case study of Egypt by identifying policy portfolios that achieve efficient mixes of poverty and inequality reduction, economic growth, and climate change mitigation. The results show that integrated policy strategies can help achieve sustainable development while balancing adverse economic, social, and political impacts of reforms.",,English,10.1038/s41467-022-32415-9,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8347,2022,Nature Communications,2041-1723,Nature Publishing Group,Nature Communications 13: 5041,policies; economic policies; sustainable development goals; poverty reduction; equality; climate change mitigation; climate change; reforms,Journal article

Biophysical and economic implications for agriculture of +1.5° and +2.0°C global warming using AgMIP Coordinated Global and Regional Assessments,"Ruane, Alex C; Antle, John; Elliott, Joshua; Folberth, Christian; Hoogenboom, Gerrit; Mason-D'Croz, Daniel; Müller, Christoph; Porter, Cheryl H.; Phillips, Meridel M.; Raymundo, Rubi M.; Sands, Ronald D.; Valdivia, Roberto; White, Jeffrey W.; Wiebe, Keith D.; Rosenzweig, Cynthia","This study presents results of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) Coordinated Global and Regional Assessments (CGRA) of +1.5° and +2.0°C global warming above pre-industrial conditions. This first CGRA application provides multi-discipline, multi-scale, and multi-model perspectives to elucidate major challenges for the agricultural sector caused by direct biophysical impacts of climate changes as well as ramifications of associated mitigation strategies. Agriculture in both target climate stabilizations is characterized by differential impacts across regions and farming systems, with tropical maize Zea mays experiencing the largest losses, while soy Glycine max mostly benefits. The result is upward pressure on prices and area expansion for maize and wheat Triticum aestivum, while soy prices and area decline (results for rice Oryza sativa are mixed). An example global mitigation strategy encouraging bioenergy expansion is more disruptive to land use and crop prices than the climate change impacts alone, even in the +2.0°C scenario which has a larger climate signal and lower mitigation requirement than the +1.5°C scenario. Coordinated assessments reveal that direct biophysical and economic impacts can be substantially larger for regional farming systems than global production changes. Regional farmers can buffer negative effects or take advantage of new opportunities via mitigation incentives and farm management technologies. Primary uncertainties in the CGRA framework include the extent of CO2 benefits for diverse agricultural systems in crop models, as simulations without CO2 benefits show widespread production losses that raise prices and expand agricultural area.",National Aeronautics and Space Agency Science Mission Directorate; U.S. Department of Agriculture; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; United States Agency for International Development USAID,English,10.3354/cr01520,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6427,2018,Climate Research,0936-577X,,Climate Research 76(1): 17-39,commodities; trade; food security; climate change; economic development; prices; biophysics; global warming; impact model,Journal article

"Building climate-resilient food systems in East and Southeast Asia: Vulnerabilities, responses and financing","Zhou, Yunyi; Chen, Ziqi; Chen, Kevin Z.","Food system resilience to climate change is uniquely imperative for bringing Sustainable Development Goals within reach and leaving no one behind. Food systems in East and Southeast Asia are interacting with planetary boundaries and are adversely affected by extreme weather-related events. A practical question for East and Southeast Asian stakeholders is how to foster climate-resilient food systems in the face of lingering food system vulnerabilities and policy gaps. This paper reviews food system vulnerabilities and policy responses to climate change. In the policy-based review, this paper compares the economy-wide and agriculture-specific targets of low-carbon development across East and Southeast Asia. With China and member states of the Association of Southeast Asia Nations as case studies, multilevel policies in building and financing climate-resilient food systems are further synthesized. The findings confirm significant differences in agriculture-specific emission goals and public financing supports across East and Southeast Asian nations. With an objective to break practical barriers and finance climate-resilient food systems for the future, this paper recommends defining agriculture-specific greenhouse gas emission goals, reorienting the public finance scheme and enhancing mechanisms for the synergy of public and private resources.",Zhejiang University,English,10.15302/j-fase-2023492,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8658,2023,Frontiers of Agricultural Science and Engineering,2095-7505,Higher Education Press,Frontiers of Agricultural Science and Engineering 10(1): 16-30,food systems; climate resilience; climate change; resiliense; climate change adaptation; climate change mitigation; climate-smart agriculture; markets; policies,Journal article

CGIAR modeling approaches for resource‐constrained scenarios: II. Accelerating crop breeding for a changing climate,"Ramirez-Vallegas, Julian; Milan, Anabel Molero; Alexandrov, Nikolai; Asseng, Senthold; Koo, Jawoo","Crop improvement efforts aiming at increasing crop production (quantity, quality) and adapting to climate change have been subject of active research over the past years. But, the question remains ‘to what extent can breeding gains be achieved under a changing climate, at a pace sufficient to usefully contribute to climate adaptation, mitigation and food security?’. Here, we address this question by critically reviewing how model‐based approaches can be used to assist breeding activities, with particular focus on all CGIAR (formerly the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research but now known simply as CGIAR) breeding programs. Crop modeling can underpin breeding efforts in many different ways, including assessing genotypic adaptability and stability, characterizing and identifying target breeding environments, identifying tradeoffs among traits for such environments, and making predictions of the likely breeding value of the genotypes. Crop modeling science within the CGIAR has contributed to all of these. However, much progress remains to be done if modeling is to effectively contribute to more targeted and impactful breeding programs under changing climates. In a period in which CGIAR breeding programs are undergoing a major modernization process, crop modelers will need to be part of crop improvement teams, with a common understanding of breeding pipelines and model capabilities and limitations, and common data standards and protocols, to ensure they follow and deliver according to clearly defined breeding products. This will, in turn, enable more rapid and better‐targeted crop modeling activities, thus directly contributing to accelerated and more impactful breeding efforts.",,English,10.1002/csc2.20048,Open Access,,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7066,2020,Crop Science,1435-0653,Crop Science Society of America,Crop Science 60(2): 547-567,modelling; crop modelling; cgiar; resources; crops; cultivation; crop production; climate; climate change; climate change adaptation; breeding; plant breeding; crop improvement; crop models,Journal article

Characteristics of distinct dietary patterns in rural Bangladesh: Nutrient adequacy and vulnerability to shocks,"Ali, Zakari; Scheelbeek, Pauline F. D.; Sanin, Kazi Istiaque; Thomas, Timothy S.; Ahmed, Tahmeed; Prentice, Andrew M.; Green, Rosemary","Food security in Bangladesh has improved in recent years, but the country is now facing a double burden of malnutrition while also being highly vulnerable to climate change. Little is known about how this may affect food supply to different sectors of the population. To inform this, we used a national dietary survey of 800 rural households to define dietary patterns using latent class analysis. Nutrient adequacy of dietary patterns and their potential vulnerability to climate shocks (based on diversity of calorie sources) were assessed. We fitted mixed effects logistic regression models to identify factors associated with dietary patterns. Four dietary patterns were identified: rice and low diversity; wheat and high diversity; pulses and vegetables; meat and fish. The wheat and high diversity and meat and fish patterns tended to be consumed by households with higher levels of wealth and education, while the rice and low diversity pattern was consumed by households with lower levels of wealth and education. The pulses and vegetables pattern was consumed by households of intermediate socio-economic status. While energy intake was high, fat and protein intake were suboptimal for all patterns except for the wheat and high diversity pattern. All patterns had fruit and vegetable intake below the WHO recommendation. The wheat and high diversity pattern was least vulnerable to shocks, while the rice and low diversity pattern was the most vulnerable, relying mainly on single cereal staples. The diets showed “double vulnerability” where the nutrient inadequate patterns were also those most vulnerable to shocks.",Wellcome Trust,English,10.3390/nu13062049,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7841,2021,Nutrients,2072-6643,MDPI,Nutrients 13(6): 2049,food security; diet; nutrition; climate change; food consumption; households; shock; malnutrition; rice; vegetables; fish; meat; vulnerability; rural areas; staples; dietary pattern; latent class analysis; farm production; diet vulnerability; nutrition transition,Journal article

Climate analogs can catalyze cross-regional dialogs for US specialty crop adaptation,"Chaudhary, Siddharth; Rajagopalan, Kirti; Kruger, Chad E.; Brady, Michael P.; Fraisse, Clyde W.; Gustafson, David I..; Hall, Sonia A.; Hoogenboom, Gerrit; Melnick, Rachel L.; Reyes, Julian; Stöckle, Claudio O.; Sulser, Timothy B.","Communication theory suggests that interactive dialog rather than information transmission is necessary for climate change action, especially for complex systems like agriculture. Climate analogs—locations whose current climate is similar to a target location’s future climate—have garnered recent interest as transmitting more relatable information; however, they have unexplored potential in facilitating meaningful dialogs, and whether the way the analogs are developed could make a difference. We developed climate context-specific analogs based on agriculturally-relevant climate metrics for US specialty crop production, and explored their potential for facilitating dialogs on climate adaptation options. Over 80% of US specialty crop counties had acceptable US analogs for the mid-twenty-first century, especially in the West and Northeast which had greater similarities in the crops produced across target-analog pairs. Western counties generally had analogs to the south, and those in other regions had them to the west. A pilot dialog of target-analog pairs showed promise in eliciting actionable adaptation insights, indicating potential value in incorporating analog-driven dialogs more broadly in climate change communication.",U.S. Department of Agriculture,English,10.1038/s41598-023-35887-x,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8739,2023,Scientific Reports,2045-2322,Nature Publishing Group,Scientific Reports 13: 9317, agriculture; climate change; climate change adaptation; communication; crops; crop production; climate analogs;  specialty crops,Journal article
Climate and poverty in Africa South of the Sahara,"Azzarri, Carlo; Signorelli, Sara","To estimate the effects of weather conditions on welfare globally, cross-country comparisons need to rely on international poverty lines and comparable data sources at the micro-level. To this end, nationally representative household surveys can offer a useful instrument, also at the sub-national level. This study seeks to expand the existing knowledge on the determinants of poverty in Africa south of the Sahara (SSA), examining how long-term climatic conditions and year-specific weather shocks affect expenditure per capita. We take advantage of a novel and unique dataset combining consumption-based household surveys for 24 SSA countries -representative of more than half of the African population and two thirds of SSA- and geospatial information on agro-climatic conditions, market access and other spatial covariates of poverty. To our knowledge, it is the first time that a welfare-based, multidisciplinary, micro-level dataset with such wide spatial coverage has been assembled and examined. Our analysis relies on a linear and spatial model at the household- and district-level, respectively, both controlling for socio-economic, demographic, and geographic confounding factors. Results are consistent across econometric approaches, showing that living in more humid areas is positively associated with welfare, while the opposite occurs living in hotter areas, as existing literature shows. Flood shocks -defined as annual rainfall higher than one standard deviation from the 50-year average- are associated to a 35% decrease in total and food per-capita consumption and 17 percentage point increase in extreme poverty. On the other hand, extreme shortages of rain and heat shocks show an uncertain effect, even when estimates control for spatial correlation between welfare and weather conditions using the spatial error correction model. Given the heterogeneous effects of climatic events across SSA macro-regions, local-specific adaptation and mitigation strategies are suggested to help bringing households on a sustainable path.",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,English,10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104691,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6852,2020,World Development,0305-750X,,World Development 125(January 2020): 104691,climate; climate change; poverty; spatial data; cartography; data; surveys; weather shocks,Journal article

"Climate change and developing country growth: The cases of Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia","Arndt, Channing; Chinowsky, Paul; Fant, Charles; Paltsev, Sergey; Schlosser, Adam; Strzepek, Kenneth; Tarp, Finn; Thurlow, James","We consider the interplay of climate change impacts, global mitigation policies, and the economic interests of developing countries to 2050. Focusing on Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia, we employ a structural approach to biophysical and economic modeling that incorporates climate uncertainty and allows for rigorous comparison of climate, biophysical, and economic outcomes across global mitigation regimes. We find that effective global mitigation policies generate two sources of benefit. First, less distorted climate outcomes result in typically more favorable and less variable economic outcomes. Second, successful global mitigation policies reduce global fossil fuel producer prices, relative to unconstrained emissions, providing a substantial terms of trade boost of structural fuel importers. Combined, these gains are on the order of or greater than estimates of mitigation costs. These results highlight the interests of most developing countries in effective global mitigation policies, even in the relatively near term, with much larger benefits post-2050.",Southern Africa – Towards Inclusive Economic Development (SA-TIED) program,English,10.1007/s10584-019-02428-3,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6653,2019,Climatic Change,0165-0009,Springer,Climatic Change 154(3-4): 335–349,climate change; developing countries; fossil fuels; food security; fuels; emission; climate change mitigation; economic growth; country growth; global mitigation policies; economic outcomes; fuel price,Journal article

Climate change effects on agriculture and food security in Tajikistan,"Khakimov, Parviz; Aliev, Jovidon; Thomas, Timothy S.; Ilyasov, Jarilkasin; Dunston, Shahnila","Climate change is one of the main challenges for Tajikistan’s agricultural development and food security both in the medium and longer term. It is considered one of the key obstacles to achieving the country’s strategic objectives as defined in the National Development Strategy for 2016–2030, which includes ensuring food security and access to quality nutrition by 2030. Using IFPRI’s International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT), this article examines the effects of climate change on agriculture and food security in Tajikistan. The model simulation results show that yields of some major crops will decline significantly and project an overall negative effect of climate change on the agriculture sector in the country. Climate change will be one of the main challenges for food security, leading to an increased number of people at risk of hunger, malnourishment, especially among children and other vulnerable groups, and insufficient per capita calorie intake. Lower food availability may lead to higher food prices, which would negatively affect the livelihood of the population.",,English,10.16997/srjed.33,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7624,2020,Silk Road: A Journal of Eurasian Development,2631-682X,University of Westminster Press,Silk Road: A Journal of Eurasian Development 2(1): 89–112,food security; models; climate change; agriculture; population; nutrition; yields; crops; impact model,Journal article
"Climate change effects on chickpea yield and its variability in Andhra Pradesh, India","Kumar, K. Nirmal Ravi; Reddy, M. Jagan Mohan; Babu, Suresh Chandra","Farmers usually do not know the precise output that is affected by climatic factors such as temperature and rainfall and are characterized by inter-annual variability, part of which is caused by global climate change. No study covers the influences of climate factors on yield and yield risk in the context of chickpea farming in Andhra Pradesh, India. In this context, this study aimed to investigate the trends in climate change variables during Rabi season (October to January, 1996-2020) and evaluated their variability on chickpea yields across different agro-climatic zones in Andhra Pradesh by employing Just and Pope production function. Four non-parametric methods-Alexandersson’s Standard Normal Homogeneity Test, Buishand’s Range Test, Pettitt’s Test and Von Neumann’s Ratio Test are applied to detect homogeneity in the data. Mann–Kendall (MK) test and Sen’s slope (SS) method were employed to analyze monthly rainfall trends and minimum and maximum temperature trends. Results of Just and Pope (panel data) quadratic and Cobb-Douglas methods revealed that monthly minimum temperature positively influenced the mean yield of chickpea (0.22% and 0.16%, respectively). However, rainfall (-0.41% and -0.31%) and maximum temperature (-0.08% and -0.04%) negatively influenced the mean yield of chickpea under quadratic and Cobb-Douglas models, respectively. Accordingly, rainfall (0.08% and 0.06%) and maximum temperature (0.83% and 0.72%) positively influenced the yield variability and minimum temperature (-0.77% and -0.67%) reduced yield variability of chickpea under quadratic and Cobb-Douglas models respectively. In view of these findings, it is imperative to advocate the farmers about the importance of cultivating drought-tolerant chickpea varieties, drought-proofing and mitigation strategies, micro-irrigation practices and improving their access to agro-meteorological information towards sustainable chickpea cultivation in Andhra Pradesh.",,English,10.31018/jans.v15i1.4102,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8956,2023,Journal of Applied and Natural Science,0974-9411,Applied and Natural Science Foundation (ANSF),Journal of Applied and Natural Science 15(1): 178 -193,chickpeas; climate change; crop yield; rainfall; rainfall patterns; research,Journal article

"Climate change, income sources, crop mix, and input use decisions: Evidence from Nigeria","Amare, Mulubrhan; Balana, Bedru","This paper combines panel data from nationally representative household-level surveys in Nigeria with long-term satellite-based spatial data on temperature and precipitation using geo-referenced information related to households. It aims to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity, income shares, crop mix, and input use decisions. We measure climate change in harmful degree days, growing degree days, and changes in precipitation using long-term (30 year) changes in temperature and precipitation anomalies during the crop calendars. We find that, controlling for other factors, a 15% (one standard deviation) increase in change in harmful degree days leads to a decrease in agricultural productivity of 5.22% on average. Similarly, precipitation change has resulted in a significant and negative impact on agricultural productivity. Our results further show that the change in harmful degree days decreases the income share from crops and nonfarm self-employment, while it increases the income share from livestock and wage employment. Examining possible transmission channels for this effect, we find that farmers change their crop mix and input use to respond to climate changes, for instance reducing fertilizer use and seed purchases as a response to increases in extreme heat. Based on our findings, we suggest policy interventions that incentivize adoption of climate-resilient agriculture, such as small-scale irrigation and livelihood diversification. We also propose targeted pro-poor interventions, such as low-cost financing options for improving smallholders' access to climate-proof agricultural inputs and technologies, and policy measures to reduce the inequality of access to livelihood capital such as land and other productive assets.",United States Agency for International Development USAID,English,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2023.107892,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8719,2023,Ecological Economics,0921-8009,Elsevier,Ecological Economics 211(September 2023): 107892,agricultural productivity; climate change; crops; data; household surveys; income; livestock; nonfarm income; smallholders; spatial data,Journal article
Climate impact and adaptation to heat and drought stress of regional and global wheat production,"Noleto Luz Pequeno, Diego; Hernandez-Ochoa, Ixchel Manuela; Reynolds, Matthew; Sonder, Kai; Molero-Milan, Anabel; Robertson, Richard","Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is the most widely grown food crop in the world threatened by future climate change. In this study, we simulated climate change impacts and adaptation strategies for wheat globally using new crop genetic traits (CGT), including increased heat tolerance, early vigor to increase early crop water use, late flowering to reverse an earlier anthesis in warmer conditions, and the combined traits with additional nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications, as an option to maximize genetic gains. These simulations were completed using three wheat crop models and five Global Climate Models (GCM) for RCP 8.5 at mid-century. Crop simulations were compared with country, US state, and US county grain yield and production. Wheat yield and production from high-yielding and low-yielding countries were mostly captured by the model ensemble mean. However, US state and county yields and production were often poorly reproduced, with large variability in the models, which is likely due to poor soil and crop management input data at this scale. Climate change is projected to decrease global wheat production by -1.9% by mid-century. However, the most negative impacts are projected to affect developing countries in tropical regions. The model ensemble mean suggests large negative yield impacts for African and Southern Asian countries where food security is already a problem. Yields are predicted to decline by -15% in African countries and -16% in Southern Asian countries by 2050. Introducing CGT as an adaptation to climate change improved wheat yield in many regions, but due to poor nutrient management, many developing countries only benefited from adaptation from CGT when combined with additional N fertilizer. As growing conditions and the impact from climate change on wheat vary across the globe, region-specific adaptation strategies need to be explored to increase the possible benefits of adaptations to climate change in the future.",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; World Bank Group; European Commission; Government of Mexico; International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA),English,10.1088/1748-9326/abd970,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7628,2021,Environmental Research Letters,1748-9326,IOP Publishing Ltd.,Environmental Research Letters 16(5): 054070,wheat; climate change; food production; drought; heat; triticum aestivum; crops; models; fertilizers; nitrogen; crop genetic traits (cgt); global climate models (gcm); wheat crop models,Journal article
Climate shock response and resilience of smallholder farmers in the drylands of south-eastern Zimbabwe,"Nkonya, Ephraim; Kato, Edward; Msimanga, Mthabisi; Nyathi, Nomqhele","Climatic shocks are exerting pressure on livelihoods of Zimbabwe's smallholder farmer—who irrigate only 2% of their farms. The smallholder farmers in drought-prone areas are more exposed to drought because of their limited ability to cope with shocks and their greater concentration in less favorable climatic regions. This study was done to analyze shock-response approaches, which farmers use to cope with climatic shocks. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were used to analyze impact of World Vision Zimbabwe (WVZ) and other actors' interventions on farmer resilience to climatic shocks. Results show that mixed cropping and diversification in general were among the major strategies that pastoralists and crop farmers used to cope with climatic shocks. Crop farmers diversified types of crops as well as raising livestock. Similarly, pastoralists started growing short-term crops. Other coping strategies included intercropping, selling livestock, moving livestock to other places that did not experience drought. Both crop producers and livestock keepers engaged in nonfarm activities. About 60% of WVZ households reported that World Vision and partners helped them respond to shock and build resilience against climate change. These coping strategies had favorable impacts on household welfare. Diversification increased dietary diversity index by more than two and the increase was much greater among female-headed households than male-headed households. The WVZ intervention also significantly reduced the odds of going to bed without eating food or sleeping hungry. Non-farm income and value of assets for WVZ beneficiaries increased by about 20% and by 22% among treated female-headed households. The results show that diversification and providing grass root training of smallholder farmers increases their resilience to climate shocks.",World Vision,English,10.3389/fclim.2023.890465,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8708,2023,Frontiers in Climate,2624-9553,Frontiers Media S.A.,Frontiers in Climate 5: 890465,agriculture; assets; climate change; diversification; drought; farmers; gender; hunger; livelihoods; livestock; mixed farming; shock; resilience; smallholders,Journal article
Climate smart agriculture and global food-crop production,"De Pinto, Alessandro; Cenacchi, Nicola; Kwon, Ho Young; Koo, Jawoo; Dunston, Shahnila","Most business-as-usual scenarios for farming under changing climate regimes project that the agriculture sector will be significantly impacted from increased temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns. Perhaps ironically, agricultural production contributes substantially to the problem with yearly greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of about 11% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions, not including land use change. It is partly because of this tension that Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) has attracted interest given its promise to increase agricultural productivity under a changing climate while reducing emissions. Considerable resources have been mobilized to promote CSA globally even though the potential effects of its widespread adoption have not yet been studied. Here we show that a subset of agronomic practices that are often included under the rubric of CSA can contribute to increasing agricultural production under unfavorable climate regimes while contributing to the reduction of GHG. However, for CSA to make a significant impact important investments and coordination are required and its principles must be implemented widely across the entire sector.",,English,10.1371/journal.pone.0231764,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7214,2020,PLoS ONE,1932-6203,PLOS,PLoS ONE 15(4): e0231764,climate change; crop production; food production; agricultural production; greenhouse gas emissions; climate-smart agriculture; models; technology; food security; decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (dssat); impact model; spatial production allocation model (spam),Journal article

Climate variability and simultaneous breadbasket yield shocks as observed in long-term yield records,"Anderson, Weston; Baethgen, Walter; Capitanio, Fabian; Ciais, Philippe; Cook, Benjamin I.; You, Liangzhi","That climate variability and change can potentially force multiple simultaneous breadbasket crop yield shocks has been established. But research quantifying the mechanisms behind such simultaneous shocks has been constrained by short records of crop yields. Here we compile a dataset of subnational crop yields in 25 countries dating back to 1900 to study the frequency and trends in multiple breadbasket yield shocks and how large-scale climate anomalies on interannual timescales have affected multiple breadbasket yield shocks over the last century. We find that major simultaneous breadbasket yield shocks have occurred in at least three, four, or five of nine breadbaskets 10.3%, 2.3% and 1.1% of the time for maize and 18.4%, 4.6% and 2.3% of the time for wheat. Furthermore, we find that multiple breadbasket yield shocks decreased in frequency even as those breadbaskets experience increasingly frequent climate-related shocks. For both maize and wheat breadbaskets, there were fewer simultaneous yield shocks during the 1975–2017 time period as compared to 1931–1975. Finally, we find that interannual modes of climate variability - such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) - have all affected the relative probability of simultaneous yield shocks in pairs of breadbaskets by up to 20–40% in both maize and wheat breadbaskets. While past literature has focused on the effects of ENSO, we find that at the global scale the NAO affects the overall number of wheat yield shocks most strongly despite only affecting northern hemisphere breadbaskets.",Columbia University,English,10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109321,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/9029,2023,Agricultural and Forest Meteorology,0168-1923,Elsevier,Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 331(15 March 2023): 109321,climate variability; climate change; bread; yields; shock; maize; wheat; el niño; oscillatory flow; north atlantic; indian ocean; multiple breadbasket failures,Journal article
Climate-mediated dynamics of the northern limit of paddy rice in China,"Liang, Shefang; Wu, Wenbin; Sun, Jing; Li, Zhipeng; Sun, Xiao; Chen, Hao; Chen, Shi; Fan, Lingling; You, Liangzhi; Yang, Peng","Paddy rice agriculture plays an important role in food security and has a considerable influence on natural systems. In the context of climate change, understanding the nature and drivers of shifts in the northern limit of paddy rice (NLPR) is crucial for adaptation strategies and food security. However, quantitative studies on the effect of climate change on paddy rice distribution shifts have not been well performed. Here, we mapped the NLPR in China using Landsat imagery from 1984 to 2013, analyzed the latitudinal and elevational dynamics of the NLPR using Fishnet analysis, and explored the factors driving the changes in rice area across the NLPR regions using a linear regression model. Our results show that between 1984 and 2013, the NLPR shifted 24.93 km northward (the greatest movement was 88.01 km occurring at approximately 133° E) and elevational limits increased by 39.15 m (the greatest movement was 117.08 m occurring at approximately 129° E). While socioeconomic factors (e.g. benefits, policies, irrigation, and mulch) played significant roles in rice area changes, the changes in rice area across the NLPR regions had the strongest positive association with the increase in the previous temperature, indicating that rice cultivation in the NLPR regions has moved to higher latitudes over the 30 year study period to adapt to climate change. Our study highlighted that quantifying the interactions between climate change and crop production systems can facilitate a better understanding of the human responses to changes in the growing conditions in the face of climate change and ensuring regional and global food security.",,English,10.1088/1748-9326/abfac0,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8026,2021,Environmental Research Letters,1748-9326,IOP Publishing,Environmental Research Letters 16(6): 064008,climate change; rice; rice fields; models; climate change adaptation; crop yield; agricultural production; climate feedback; northern limit of paddy rice (nlpr),Journal article
Climate-smart agriculture and food security: Cross-country evidence from West Africa,"Tabe-Ojong, Martin Paul Jr.; Aihounton, Ghislain B. D.; Lokossou, Jourdain C.","In the face of climate change and extreme weather events which continue to have significant impacts on agricultural production, climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has emerged as one important entry point in reducing the emission of greenhouse gases and building climate resilience while ensuring increases in agricultural productivity with ensuing implications on food and nutrition security. We examine the relationship between CSA, land productivity (yields), and food security using a survey of farm households in Ghana, Mali, and Nigeria. To understand the correlates of the adoption of these CSA practices as well as the association between CSA, yields, and food security, we use switching regressions that account for multiple endogenous treatments. We find a positive association between the adoption of CSA practices and yields. This increase in yields translate to food security as we observe a positive association between CSA and food consumption scores. Although we show modest associations between the independent use of CSA practices such as adopting climate-smart groundnut varieties, cereal-groundnut intercropping, and the use of organic fertilizers, we find that bundling these practices may lead to greater yield and food security gains. Under the different combinations, the use of climate-smart groundnut varieties exhibit the strongest association with yields and food security. We also estimate actual-counterfactual relationships where we show that the adoption of CSA practices is not only beneficial to CSA adopters but could potentially be beneficial to non-CSA adopters should they adopt. These results have implications for reaching some of the sustainable development targets, especially the twin goals of increasing agricultural productivity and maintaining environmental sustainability.",United States Agency for International Development USAID,English,10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2023.102697,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8731,2023,Global Environmental Change,0959-3780,Elsevier,Global Environmental Change 81(July 2023): 102697,climate-smart agriculture; climate change; climate change adaptation; climate change mitigation; land productivity; food security; yields; climate resilience; adoption,Journal article

But these publications paint an incomplete, and likely overly optimistic, picture of the threat that anthropogenic environmental change poses to food production, nutrition, and health. Projected effects of climate change on food security are often based on crop models that incorporate only a few dimensions of climate related biophysical change—usually characterized by changes in temperature and precipitation.

Disability-adjusted life years due to chronic and hidden hunger under food system evolution with climate change and adaptation to 2050,"Sulser, Timothy B.; Beach, Robert H.; Wiebe, Keith D.; Dunston, Shahnila; Fukagawa, Naomi K.","Background: Climate change presents an increasing challenge for food-nutrition security. Nutrition metrics calculated from quantitative food system projections can help focus policy actions.
Objectives: To estimate future chronic and hidden hunger disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)-due to protein-energy undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies, respectively-using food systems projections to evaluate the potential impact of climate change and agricultural sector investment for adaptation.
Methods: We use a novel combination of a chronic and hidden hunger DALY estimation procedure and food system projections from quantitative foresight modeling to assess DALYs under alternative agricultural sector scenarios to midcentury.
Results: Total chronic and hidden hunger DALYs are projected to increase globally out to 2050-by over 30 million compared with 2010-even without climate change. Climate change increases total DALY change between 2010 and 2050 by nearly 10% compared with no climate change. Agricultural sector investments show promise for offsetting these impacts. With investments, DALY incidence due to chronic and hidden hunger is projected to decrease globally in 2050 by 0.24 and 0.56 per 1000 capita, respectively. Total global DALYs will still rise because projected population growth will outpace the rate reduction, especially in Africa south of the Sahara. However, projections also show important regional reductions in total DALYs due to chronic (13.9 million in South Asia, 4.3 million in East Asia and the Pacific) and hidden hunger (7.5 million in East Asia and the Pacific) with investments.
Conclusions: Food system projections to 2050 show a decreasing DALY incidence from both chronic and hidden hunger. Population growth is projected to outpace these improvements and lead to increasing total chronic and hidden hunger DALYs globally, concentrated in Africa south of the Sahara. Climate change increases per-capita chronic and hidden hunger DALY incidence compared with no climate change.

"Drought‐tolerant rice, weather index insurance, and comprehensive risk management for smallholders: Evidence from a multi‐year field experiment in India","Ward, Patrick S.; Makhija, Simrin; Spielman, David J.","In rainfed production systems throughout India, agricultural activities are dependent upon the summer monsoon, and any aberration in monsoon rainfall patterns can have severe consequences for rice production. There is considerable policy interest in designing programs to lower small‐scale farmers’ exposure to these types of risk given the regularity with which adverse monsoon events occur. This paper introduces a field experiment conducted with two risk management options in the state of Odisha: a drought‐tolerant rice cultivar; and a weather index insurance product designed to complement the performance of the cultivar. Uptake rates for the cultivar itself and for the joint product are compared across two years alongside an analysis of factors that predict uptake. Results indicate high levels of demand for both the products, albeit with a significant degree of price sensitivity. But this sensitivity is agnostic to the nature of price reductions, suggesting that public investments that lower the costs of risk management may be sufficient to encourage broad uptake, without necessarily relying upon distortionary subsidies as is so often done. Sustained demand between years one and two is primarily explained where individuals were indemnified in year one and had a large number of peers also purchasing the product.",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; United States Agency for International Development USAID,English,10.1111/1467-8489.12342,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6867,2020,Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics,1364-985X,,Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics 64(2): 421-454,drought tolerance; rice; smallholders; risk management; monsoon climate; insurance; climate change; drought; index insurance,Journal article

Economywide effects of climate‐smart agriculture in Ethiopia,"Komarek, Adam M.; Thurlow, James; Koo, Jawoo; De Pinto, Alessandro","Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an approach for transforming and reorienting agricultural systems to support food security under climate change. Few studies, however, quantify at the national scale CSA’s economic effects or compare CSA to input-intensive technologies, like fertilizer and irrigation. Such quantification may help with priority setting among competing agricultural investment options. Our study uses an integrated biophysical and economic modeling approach to quantify and contrast the economywide effects of CSA (integrated soil fertility management) and input-intensive technologies in Ethiopia’s cereal systems. We simulate impacts for 20-year sequences of variable weather, with and without climate change. Results indicate that adopting CSA technologies on a quarter of Ethiopia’s maize and wheat land increases annual gross domestic product (GDP) by an average 0.18 percent (US$49.8 million) and reduces the national poverty rate by 0.15 percentage points (112,100 people). CSA is more effective than doubling fertilizer use on the same area, which increases GDP by US$33.0 million and assists 73,300 people out of poverty. CSA and fertilizer have some substitutability, but CSA and irrigation appear complementary. Although not a panacea for food security concerns, greater adoption of CSA technologies in Ethiopia could deliver economic gains but would need substantial tailoring to farmer-specific contexts.",,English,10.1111/agec.12523,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6862,2019,Agricultural Economics,0169-5150,"Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Agricultural Economics 50(6): 765-778,climate change; economic growth; poverty; climate; agriculture; technology; climate-smart agriculture (csa); computable general equilibrium (cge) model,Journal article

Elevating the role of water resilience in food system dialogues,"Ringler, Claudia; Matthews, Nathanial; Dalton, James; Barclay, Holly; Barron, Jennie; Garrick, Dustin","Ensuring resilient food systems and sustainable healthy diets for all requires much higher water use, however, water resources are finite, geographically dispersed, volatile under climate change, and required for other vital functions including ecosystems and the services they provide. Good governance for resilient water resources is a necessary precursor to deciding on solutions, sourcing finance, and delivering infrastructure. Six attributes that together provide a foundation for good governance to reduce future water risks to food systems are proposed. These attributes dovetail in their dual focus on incorporating adaptive learning and new knowledge, and adopting the types of governance systems required for water resilient food systems. The attributes are also founded in the need to greater recognise the role natural, healthy ecosystems play in food systems. The attributes are listed below and are grounded in scientific evidence and the diverse collective experience and expertise of stakeholders working across the science-policy interface: Adopting interconnected systems thinking that embraces the complexity of how we produce, distribute, and add value to food including harnessing the experience and expertise of stakeholders s; adopting multi-level inclusive governance and supporting inclusive participation; enabling continual innovation, new knowledge and learning, and information dissemination; incorporating diversity and redundancy for resilience to shocks; ensuring system preparedness to shocks; and planning for the long term. This will require food and water systems to pro-actively work together toward a socially and environmentally just space that considers the water and food needs of people, the ecosystems that underpin our food systems, and broader energy and equity concerns.",,English,10.1016/j.wasec.2022.100126,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8427,2022,Water Security,2468-3124,Elsevier,Water Security 17(December 2022): 100126,food systems; sustainability; healthy diets; water use; climate change; ecosystems; governance; risk; stakeholders; information dissemination; policies,Journal article

Extreme events and production shocks for key crops in southern Africa under climate change,"Thomas, Timothy S.; Robertson, Richard D.; Strzepek, Kenneth M.; Arndt, Channing","Many studies have estimated the effect of climate change on crop productivity, often reflecting uncertainty about future climates by using more than one emissions pathway or multiple climate models, usually fewer than 30, and generally much fewer, with focus on the mean changes. Here we examine four emissions scenarios with 720,000 future climates per scenario over a 50-year period. We focus on the effect of low-frequency, high-impact weather events on crop yields in 10 countries of Southern Africa, aggregating from nearly 9,000 25-kilometer-square locations. In the highest emissions scenario, median maize yield is projected to fall by 9.2% for the region while the 5th percentile is projected to fall by 15.6% between the 2020s and 2060s. Furthermore, the frequency of a low frequency, 1-in-20-year low-yield event for rainfed maize is likely to occur every 3.5 years by the 2060s under the high emissions scenario. We also examine the impact of climate change on three other crops of considerable importance to the region: drybeans, groundnuts, and soybeans. Projected yield decline for each of these crops is less than for maize, but the impact varies from country to country and within each country. In many cases, the median losses are modest, but the losses in the bad weather years are generally much higher than under current climate, pointing to more frequent bouts with food insecurity for the region, unless investments are made to compensate for those production shocks.","National Treasury, Republic of South Africa",English,10.3389/fclim.2022.787582,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8271,2022,Frontiers in Climate,,Frontiers,Frontiers in Climate 4: 787582,extreme weather events; climate; climate change; crops; production; shock; yields; models; crop modelling; food production; food security; climate uncertainty; yield emulator,Journal article

Ex‐ante evaluation of promising soybean innovations for sub‐Saharan Africa,"Gbegbelegbe, Sika; Alene, Arega; Kamara, Alpha; Wiebe, Keith D.; Manyong, Victor M.; Abdoulaye, Tahirou; Mkandawire, Petros","This study undertakes an ex‐ante evaluation of the effects of alternative technology and policy options on soybean supply and demand in sub‐Saharan Africa (SSA) to 2050. Current soybean consumption in SSA is dominated by cooking oil followed by soybean cake used as animal feed. Due to weak processing sectors and low soybean yields, the region is currently importing about 70% of its consumption requirements. Based on the results from a geospatial bio‐economic modeling framework, soybean consumption in SSA is projected to more than double by 2050 compared to 2010 due in part to a rising population and rising incomes. On the other hand, supply from domestic production is projected to increase by 80% over the same period. Hence, by 2050, net imports into SSA would be nearly 4 times higher than supply from domestic production. Under a future drier climate, some of the production gains achieved through soybean research and extension would be lost and this would further worsen the soybean demand gap in SSA relative to the baseline. This study shows that relying on conventional breeding alone to increase soybean yields in SSA would not be enough to substantially reduce the future demand gap. A combination of promising innovations affecting the soybean value chain across SSA would be needed to close the soybean demand gap in SSA by 2050 under a drier future climate.",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,English,10.1002/fes3.172,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6885,2019,Food and Energy Security,,John Wiley & Sons; Association of Applied Biologists,Food and Energy Security 8(4): e00172,innovation; soybeans; food consumption; supply chain; climate change; spatial data; trade; prices; impact model; import dependency,Journal article
"Factors associated with farmers’ use of indigenous and scientific climate forecasts in Rwenzori region, Western Uganda","Nbuka, Michael Robert; Chanda, Raban; Mmopelwa, Gagoitseope; Kato, Edward; Mangheni, Margaret Najjingo; Lesolle, David; Adedoyin, Akintayo; Mujuni, Godfrey","Although scientific climate forecast (SF) distribution by national climate services has improved over time, farmers seem not to make good use of climate forecasts, a likely contributing factor to vulnerability to climate change. This study investigated factors associated with farmers’ use of SFs and indigenous forecasts (IFs) for agricultural use in the Rwenzori region, western Uganda. Household survey gathered data on demographic characteristics, climate information use and livelihood choices from 580 farmers. Data was analysed using the probit model. Results showed that significant factors associated with using both IFs and SFs were farm size, education, age, reception of scientific forecasts in local languages, agricultural extension access, short-mature crop access, farmer-to-farmer network and accessing forecasts through radio. This study shows that IFs were used complementarily with SFs. On the other hand, significant factors associated with using IFs only were livelihood choices such as tuber and goat production, access to government interventions on climate change adaptations, agro-ecological zone and social capital. Climate risks and climate risk perceptions negatively influenced the use of scientific forecasts. Co-production of climate information, capacity-building and active engagement of stakeholders in dissemination mechanisms can improve climate forecast use. Investments in more weather stations in various districts will therefore be a key factor in obtaining more accurate scientific forecasts and could lead to increased use of scientific climate forecasts.

Food systems for sustainable development: Proposals for a profound four-part transformation,"Caron, Patrick; Ferrero y de Loma-Osorio, Gabriel; Nabarro, David; Hainzelin, Etienne; Fan, Shenggen","Evidence shows the importance of food systems for sustainable development: they are at the nexus that links food security, nutrition, and human health, the viability of ecosystems, climate change, and social justice. However, agricultural policies tend to focus on food supply, and sometimes, on mechanisms to address negative externalities. We propose an alternative. Our starting point is that agriculture and food systems’ policies should be aligned to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This calls for deep changes in comparison with the paradigms that prevailed when steering the agricultural change in the XXth century. We identify the comprehensive food systems transformation that is needed. It has four parts: first, food systems should enable all people to benefit from nutritious and healthy food. Second, they should reflect sustainable agricultural production and food value chains. Third, they should mitigate climate change and build resilience. Fourth, they should encourage a renaissance of rural territories. The implementation of the transformation relies on (i) suitable metrics to aid decision-making, (ii) synergy of policies through convergence of local and global priorities, and (iii) enhancement of development approaches that focus on territories. We build on the work of the “Milano Group,” an informal group of experts convened by the UN Secretary General in Milan in 2015. Backed by a literature review, what emerges is a strategic narrative linking climate, agriculture and food, and calling for a deep transformation of food systems at scale. This is critical for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. The narrative highlights the needed consistency between global actions for sustainable development and numerous local-level innovations. It emphasizes the challenge of designing differentiated paths for food systems transformation responding to local and national expectations. Scientific and operational challenges are associated with the alignment and arbitration of local action within the context of global priorities.",,English,10.1007/s13593-018-0519-1,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6802,2018,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,1774-0746,,Agronomy for Sustainable Development 38(4): 41,food systems; climate change; sustainable development; agriculture,Journal article

Looking forward, development goals of this sector must address challenges associated with climate change, including changing distribution of commercially important marine species such as tuna and disruptions to land-based aquaculture production systems. This study investigates the prospective climate change impacts on Vietnam's fisheries sector, focusing on four key commodities including capture fisheries (tuna), freshwater aquaculture (pangasius catfish and tilapia), and brackish water aquaculture (shrimp). The extent of impact varies, but climate change represents a potentially significant threat to sustainable production in each production system.

Four ways blue foods can help achieve food system ambitions across nations,"Crona, Beatrice I.; Wassénius, Emmy; Jonell, Malin; Koehn, J. Zachary; Short, Rebecca; Tigchelaar, Michelle; Daw, Tim M.; Kishore, Avinash","Blue foods, sourced in aquatic environments, are important for the economies, livelihoods, nutritional security and cultures of people in many nations. They are often nutrient rich, generate lower emissions and impacts on land and water than many terrestrial meats, and contribute to the health, wellbeing and livelihoods of many rural communities. The Blue Food Assessment recently evaluated nutritional, environmental, economic and justice dimensions of blue foods globally. Here we integrate these fndings and translate them into four policy objectives to help realize the contributions that blue foods can make to national food systems around the world: ensuring supplies of critical nutrients, providing healthy alternatives to terrestrial meat, reducing dietary environmental footprints and safeguarding blue food contributions to nutrition, just economies and livelihoods under a changing climate. To account for how context-specifc environmental, socio-economic and cultural aspects afect this contribution, we assess the relevance of each policy objective for individual countries, and examine associated co-benefts and trade-ofs at national and international scales. We fnd that in many African and South American nations, facilitating consumption of culturally relevant blue food, especially among nutritionally vulnerable population segments, could address vitamin B12 and omega-3 defciencies. Meanwhile, in many global North nations, cardiovascular disease rates and large greenhouse gas footprints from ruminant meat intake could be lowered through moderate consumption of seafood with low environmental impact.

From bad to worse: Poverty impacts of food availability responses to weather shocks,"Koo, Jawoo; Mamun, Abdullah; Martin, Will","Since Amartya Sen's famous work on Poverty and Famines, economists have understood that the impacts of food market shocks on the poor depend much more on their impacts on households’ incomes and access to food than on overall food availability, and that availability-based policies frequently exacerbate adverse impacts on household welfare. Perhaps because household-level impacts are not directly observable many policy makers have continued to rely on availability-oriented policies such as export bans. In the Zambia case considered in this article, export bans imposed in response to an El Niño event appear to have greatly exacerbated the small increase in poverty resulting from the weather shock. The combination of household-level data and crop models used in this article allows us to assess the impacts of weather and price shocks at the household level, and to evaluate the suitability of availability-based policies for dealing with weather shocks. These analytical techniques can also help identify the households and regions adversely affected, and design policies to improve poor consumers’ access to food.",World Bank Group,English,10.1111/agec.12657,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7834,2021,Agricultural Economics,0169-5150,International Association of Agricultural Economists (IAAE),Agricultural Economics 52(5): 833-847,spatial data; climate change; el nino; models; food security; exports; trade; trade policies; poverty; weather; food supply; households; weather shocks,Journal article
"Gender, agriculture policies, and climate-smart agriculture in India","Barooah, Prapti; Alvi, Muzna; Ringler, Claudia; Pathak, Vishal ","CONTEXT: India's agricultural systems are increasingly affected by climate change's adverse effects. The Government of India has an impressive set of programs to address this issue, but they have substantial shortcomings, especially in reaching women farmers.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to understand policy and implementation gaps in reaching women farmers with climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices and study how women and men farmer's different roles in agriculture shape their needs and access to complementary services needed to adapt to climate change.
METHODS: An extensive review of India's agriculture and climate policies and program and a series of focus group discussions with farmers in Gujarat, India to discuss constraints and potential entry points for better reaching women farmers with CSA practices.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Women's increased vulnerability to climate change and reduced access to CSA practices can be attributed to limited land ownership, poor access to credit, reduced access to information and formal extension, and multiple pressures on their time. Village cooperatives and self-help groups can be leveraged to support women's access to agricultural information and adoption of CSA practices.
SIGNIFICANCE: This paper highlights constraints to information and extension access by Indian women farmers that could impede the widespread adoption of CSA practices. It fills an important knowledge gap in designing gender-responsive policies and inclusive agricultural extension systems to promote adoption of CSA practices among smallholder farmers.",Bundesministerium für Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ),English,10.1016/j.agsy.2023.103751,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8878,2023,Agricultural Systems,0308-521X,Elsevier,Agricultural Systems 212(December 2023): 103751,agriculture; climate change; climate-smart agriculture; farming systems; gender; women; women farmers; vulnerability,Journal article

Global investment gap in agricultural research and innovation to meet Sustainable Development Goals for hunger and Paris Agreement climate change mitigation,"Rosegrant, Mark W.; Sulser, Timothy B.; Wiebe, Keith D.","This paper provides estimates of the global investment gap in agricultural research and development (R&D) and innovation. The investment gap is defined as the additional annual investments required to end hunger in 2030 (Sustainable Development Goal SDG2) and to put agriculture on the pathway to the Paris Agreement target for 1.5◦C increase over pre-industrial temperature levels. The investment gap is projected relative to a reference scenario with projections to 2030 using an integrated economic-biophysical model of the global agri-food system. In addition to showing the impacts on hunger, the modeling results are used to simulate the effect of the gap-closing investments on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture. In addition to projecting the impacts of overall investment in agricultural R&D on productivity and environmental outcomes, the analysis assesses the contributions of different types of innovative technologies and farming systems to the environmental outcomes, especially technologies that contribute to sustainability outcomes. Sustainability-oriented technologies and management practices examined include conservation tillage, nitrogen-use efficiency, improved livestock management, and other climate-smart technologies. The projected results show that additional agricultural R&D investments of USD 4 billion per year above baseline investments together with USD 6.5 billion per year invested in technical climate-smart options, can reduce hunger to 5% globally and achieve 2030 GHG emission reductions consistent with the Paris Agreement 2◦C and 1.5◦C pathways to 2030.","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office FCDO",English,10.3389/fsufs.2022.965767,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8395,2022,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,2571-581X,Frontiers Media S.A.,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems 6; 96576,agricultural research; agricultural development; investment; hunger; sustainable development goals; paris agreement; temperature; climate change; agrifood systems; greenhouse gas emissions; agriculture; technology; farming systems; sustainability; conservation tillage; livestock management; global investment gap; nitrogen use efficiency; impact model,Journal article

Harvested area gaps in China between 1981 and 2010: Effects of climatic and land management factors,"Yu, Qiangyi; van Vliet, Jasper; Verburg, Peter H.; You, Liangzhi; Yang, Peng; Wu, Wenbin","Previous analyses have shown that cropland in China is intensifying leading to an increase in crop production. However, these output measures leave the potential for further intensification largely unassessed. This study uses the harvested area gap (HAG), which expresses the amount of harvested area that can be gained if all existing cropland is harvested as frequently as possible, according to their potential limit for multi-cropping. Specifically, we calculate the HAG and changes in the HAG in China between 1981 and 2010. We further assess how climatic and land management factors affect these changes. We find that in China the HAG decreases between the 1980s and the 1990s, and subsequently increases between the 1990s and the 2000s, resulting in a small net increase for the entire study period. The initial decrease in the HAG is the result of an increase in the average multi-cropping index throughout the country, which is larger than the increase in the potential multi-cropping index as a result of the changed climatic factors. The subsequent increase in the HAG is the result of a decrease in average multi-cropping index throughout the country, in combination with a stagnant potential. Despite the overall increase in harvested area in China, many regions, e.g. Northeast and Lower Yangtze, are characterized by an increased HAG indicating their potential for further increasing the multi-cropping index. The study demonstrates the application of the HAG as a method to identify areas where the harvested area can increase to increase crop production, which is currently underexplored in scientific literature.",Fundamental Research Funds for Central Non-profit Scientific Institution; European Commission; National Natural Science Foundation of China; China Scholarship Council,English,10.1088/1748-9326/aaafe0,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6181,2018,Environmental Research Letters,,IOP Publishing Ltd,Environmental Research Letters 13: 044006,climate change; multiple cropping; food security; harvesting frequency; land management; crop production; land use; intensification; land use intensity; land use change; cropping frequency,Journal article
Health gender gap in Uganda: do weather effects and water play a role?,"Amondo, Emily Injete; Kirui, Oliver K.; Mirzabaev, Alisher; kirui","Vulnerabilities of men and women to adverse health effects due to weather variability and climate change are not equal. Uganda was among the countries in the world most affected by extreme weather events during the last decade. However, there is still limited gendered empirical evidence on the links between weather variability and health and the possible pathways through which these health effects occur. Therefore, this study analyses the effect of weather variability on illness, and the extent to which water collection ‘time burden’ mediates the relationship between weather anomalies and illness among men and women of working age in Uganda.

"Heat shocks, maize yields, and child height in Tanzania","Block, S.; Haile, Beliyou; You, Liangzhi; Headey, Derek D.","The growing threat that climate shocks pose to food, water and nutrition security makes understanding the linkages between climate and nutrition increasingly urgent. The article demonstrates an empirical connection between rising temperatures, cereal yields, and poorer growth outcomes for children—the first time such a link has been established between climate shocks, agricultural productivity, and health.
The authors find that extreme temperature shocks can severely reduce maize yields, and that lower yields in the season prior to birth are a strong predictor of reduced height in later years, especially among boys. They also show that lower maize yields are predictive of lower body mass among women but not predictive of diarrhea or fever incidence in children. Taken together, these results suggest that maternal malnutrition during pregnancy is a key pathway linking heat shocks and agricultural production to subsequent child health.
The findings have important implications for policymakers responding to climate impacts, who must weigh whether to focus more on agricultural interventions and social protection or on public health interventions. Our research suggests the first approach could be particularly important in rural Africa.",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,English,10.1007/s12571-021-01211-6,Restricted,,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7938,2022,Food Security,1876-4517,Springer,Food Security 14: 93-109,yeilds; heat; maize; nutrition; children; height; heat shock; yield losses; malnutrition; child nutrition; climate change; gender; child height,Journal article
Hierarchical modelling of small-scale irrigation: Constraints and opportunities for adoption in sub-Saharan Africa,"Haile, Beliyou; Mekonnen, Dawit; Choufani, Jowel; Ringler, Claudia; Bryan, Elizabeth","Irrigation has significant potential to enhance productivity, resilience to climatic risks and nutrition security in Sub-Saharan Africa. While the focus has historically been on large-scale dam-based schemes, farmer-managed small-scale irrigation (SSI) has gained increased attention in recent years. Using data from Ethiopia, Tanzania and Ghana, we first examine patterns of adoption of different SSI technologies. Next, we employ hierarchical modelling to examine which variables are associated with observed adoption patterns and cluster effects that explain variation in irrigation adoption. We document significant cross-country variation in adoption patterns and find a positive association between plot-level use of SSI and the intensity of agricultural labor and inorganic fertilizers applied on the plot. Community-level intra-cluster correlation (ICC) is the highest in Tanzania, where gravity-fed irrigation is most common while farm-level ICC is the highest in Ethiopia where motorized technologies are more common. These results suggest the need for localized investments to ease locale-specific potential constraints. For example, easing possible liquidity constraints to acquiring motorized technologies can be more effective in Ethiopia while the construction of dams and improved conveyance systems, as well as the strengthening of community-based irrigation management (e.g., through Water User Associations (WUAs)) can be more effective in Tanzania. Further research is needed to understand pathways for selected plot-level characteristics that affect use of SSI including status of plot ownership and the gender of the plot manager.",United States Agency for International Development USAID,English,10.1142/s2382624x22500059,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8228,2022,Water Economics and Policy,2382-6258,World Scientific Publishing,Water Economics and Policy 8(1): 2250005,irrigation; technology; modelling; agricultural productivity; farmers; climate change; climatic risks; hierarchical model; small-scale irrigation,Journal article
History of anthropogenic Nitrogen inputs (HaNi) to the terrestrial biosphere: A 5 arcmin resolution annual dataset from 1860 to 2019,"Tian, Hanqin; Bian, Zihao; Shi, Hao; Qin, Xiaoyu; Pan, Naiqing; You, Liangzhi","Excessive anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs to the biosphere have disrupted the global nitrogen cycle. To better quantify the spatial and temporal patterns of anthropogenic N inputs, assess their impacts on the biogeochemical cycles of the planet and the living organisms, and improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) for sustainable development, we have developed a comprehensive and synthetic dataset for reconstructing the History of anthropogenic Nitrogen inputs (HaNi) to the terrestrial biosphere. The HaNi dataset takes advantage of different data sources in a spatiotemporally consistent way to generate a set of high-resolution gridded N input products from the preindustrial period to the present (1860–2019). The HaNi dataset includes annual rates of synthetic N fertilizer, manure application/deposition, and atmospheric N deposition on cropland, pasture, and rangeland at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin × 5 arcmin. Specifically, the N inputs are categorized, according to the N forms and land uses, into 10 types: (1) -N fertilizer applied to cropland, (2) NO-N fertilizer applied to cropland, (3) -N fertilizer applied to pasture, (4) NO-N fertilizer applied to pasture, (5) manure N application on cropland, (6) manure N application on pasture, (7) manure N deposition on pasture, (8) manure N deposition on rangeland, (9) NHx-N deposition, and (10) NOy-N deposition. The total anthropogenic N (TN) inputs to global terrestrial ecosystems increased from 29.05 Tg N yr−1 in the 1860s to 267.23 Tg N yr−1 in the 2010s, with the dominant N source changing from atmospheric N deposition (before the 1900s) to manure N (in the 1910s–2000s) and then to synthetic fertilizer in the 2010s. The proportion of synthetic -N in fertilizer input increased from 64 % in the 1960s to 90 % in the 2010s, while synthetic NO-N fertilizer decreased from 36 % in the 1960s to 10 % in the 2010s. Hotspots of TN inputs shifted from Europe and North America to East and South Asia during the 1960s–2010s. Such spatial and temporal dynamics captured by the HaNi dataset are expected to facilitate a comprehensive assessment of the coupled human–Earth system and address a variety of social welfare issues, such as the climate–biosphere feedback, air pollution, water quality, and biodiversity.

How climate change interacts with inequity to affect nutrition,"Salm, Leah; Nisbett, Nicholas; Cramer, Laura; Gillespie, Stuart; Thornton, Philip","Climate change poses a growing threat to the achievement of optimal nutritional status, both directly through affecting food production and indirectly through altering social and economic influences in people's lives. These adverse nutrition outcomes are not evenly distributed across the world, and vulnerable populations are the most impacted. Understanding how different forms of inequity interact with climate change and adverse nutritional outcomes is a novel area of research in today's challenging environment of increased climate change pressures. This article presents the results of a systematic literature search undertaken to identify the connections, trends and pathways between climate change, inequity and nutrition outcomes. Forty‐six peer‐reviewed studies are identified that explore these complex interactions with a specific focus on the extent to which equity is a fundamental component of climate change and nutrition research. The pathways captured in this body of evidence are mapped to current framework thinking to identify trends and gaps. While there is a trend for studies to acknowledge an unfair distribution of vulnerability to adverse nutrition outcomes, there is less attention given to the (lack of) recognition of the social situations which increase these groups' vulnerability and the absence of representation or inclusion of these groups as vital decision‐makers. Studies that do incorporate these core dimensions of equity take mixed‐method and qualitative approaches. This highlights an inherent value in stepping outside the usual scope of empirical climate change research, one that incorporates the voices of those most affected.",,English,10.1002/wcc.696,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7543,2021,Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change,1757-7799,John Wiley & Sons,Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change 12(2): e696,nutrition; climate change; systematic reviews; equity; greenhouse gas emissions,Journal article
How does climate change affect poor people in Africa?,"Azzarri, Carlo; Signorelli, Sara","Our planet is warming up! That doesn’t mean we will have nicer weather, though. It means we have weather events that are more extreme. Floods, droughts, and heatwaves are more powerful and are happening more often. People lose their homes, jobs, and eat less food. And poor people suffer the most! People who are very poor do not have enough resources to handle the effects of extreme weather events. To help them in the future, we need a good understanding of what is happening now. We studied one of the poorest regions in the world, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We analyzed data from thousands of families living all across the continent and looked at what happens to them when extreme weather events occur. We found that floods had a worse impact than heatwaves and droughts. Finally, we predicted that because of climate change, the number of people living in poverty there could increase in 10 years. Our results could be very useful for planning ways to help people in Africa.

Impact of climate change on agriculture in Kazakhstan,"Islyami, Aidan; Aldashev, Alisher; Thomas, Timothy S.; Dunston, Shahnila","Using the Global IMPACT model, we investigate the probable effect of climate change on the performance of agriculture and socio-economic conditions in Kazakhstan under five climate-change scenarios. These include a baseline and four climate-change scenarios (MIROC, Hadgem, GFDL, and IPSL) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). More specifically, we focus on climate-change impact on the production of wheat, potatoes, cotton, maize, rice, and barley. The results suggest that increased temperatures and precipitation will hurt spring crop yields such as wheat and barley. Climate change will probably positively impact the yields of winter varieties of wheat and barley and enable farmers to practise multiple cropping during a farming season. Rice yield is also expected to increase due to climate change, but the yield of potatoes is projected to be adversely affected. Therefore, climate change will be one of the critical challenges for improving agricultural productivity, household welfare, and ensuring food and nutrition security in Kazakhstan.",,English,10.16997/srjed.19,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7625,2020,Silk Road: A Journal of Eurasian Development,2631-682X,University of Westminster Press,Silk Road: A Journal of Eurasian Development 2(1): 66–88,models; climate change; agriculture; agricultural productivity; households; food policies; policies; nutrition; food security; rice; potatoes; crops; yields; maize; cotton; impact model,Journal article

In pursuit of more fruitful food systems,"Sulser, Timothy B.; Wiebe, Keith D.; Gustafson, David; Asseng, Senthold; Fraisse, Clyde; Guan, Kaiyu","Recent analyses suggest that global fruit and vegetable (F&V) production will need to increase by 50–150% by 2050 to achieve sustainable and healthy diets for all 10 billion people expected to inhabit the world (Stratton et al. 2021). Meeting this increased demand will be very difficult due to numerous factors, including the scarcity of labor, dwindling water supplies for irrigation, and climate change. We have just completed a 5-year project (Agriculture and Food Systems Institute 2022) that began to tackle this daunting challenge: fruit and vegetable supply chains: climate adaptation and mitigation opportunities. We identified and tested climate adaptation and mitigation strategies in these supply chains through the development and application of a novel integrated methodology that included climate, crop, economic, and life cycle assessment (LCA) models, following protocols developed by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) (https://agmip.org/).

Increasing social-ecological resilience within small-scale agriculture in conflict-affected Guatemala,"Hellin, Jon; Ratner, Blake D.; Meinzen-Dick, Ruth Suseela; Lopez-Ridaura, Santiago","Climate change scenarios suggest largely detrimental impacts on agricultural production from a deterioration of renewable natural resources. Over the last 15 years, a new field of research has focused on the interactions between climate and conflict risk, particularly as it relates to competition over natural resources and livelihoods. Within this field, there has been less attention to the potential for resource competition to be managed in ways that yield greater cooperation, local adaptation capacity, social-ecological resilience, and conflict mitigation or prevention. The challenge of increasing social-ecological resilience in small-scale agriculture is particularly acute in the socioeconomically and agroecologically marginalized Western Highlands of Guatemala. Not only is climate change a threat to agriculture in this region, but adaptation strategies are challenged by the context of a society torn apart by decades of violent conflict. Indeed, the largely indigenous population in the Western Highlands has suffered widespread discrimination for centuries. The armed conflict has left a legacy of a deeply divided society, with communities often suspicious of outsider interventions and in many cases with neighbors pitted against each other. We use the example of the Buena Milpa agricultural development project to demonstrate how grassroots approaches to collective action, conflict prevention, and social-ecological resilience, linking local stakeholder dynamics to the broader institutional and governance context, can bear fruit amidst postconflict development challenges. Examples of microwatershed management and conservation of local maize varieties illustrate opportunities to foster community-level climate adaptation strategies within small-scale farming systems even in deeply divided societies.",United States Agency for International Development USAID,English,10.5751/es-10250-230305,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6300,2018,Ecology and Society,,The Resilience Alliance,Ecology and Society 23(3): 5,agriculture; climate change; collective behaviour; conflict; resilience; grassroots organizations; case studies; natural resources management; climate change adaptation,Journal article
"Indigenous knowledge systems and indicators of rain: Evidence from Rwenzori Region, Western Uganda","Nkuba, Michael Robert; Chanda, Raban; Mmopelwa, Gagoitseope; Mangheni, Margaret Najjingo; Lesolle, David; Kato, Edward","This study investigated the abiotic and biotic environmental indicators used among pastoralists and arable farmers to predict the onset and cessation of rain as well as to make short-term and seasonal forecasts in the Rwenzori region of Western Uganda. We used a mixed-methods approach that included surveys of 907 households, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. The results indicate that resident birds such as white-browed coucals and turacos and migrant birds such as eagles and swallows were important indicators of the onset of rains. Butterflies were an important indicator for the cessation of rains, and red ants were an indicator for the onset of rains. Among the abiotic indicators, winds, clouds, earthquakes, and cloud formation on Mount Rwenzori were important indicators. Behavior of cattle at the onset of rains was important among the pastoralists, and flowering of coffee plants was important among the arable farmers. The behavior of the biotic indicators was driven by the availability of food, water, or other necessities. An attempt to explain the phenology underlying the behavior of biotic indicators and the meteorological science underlying some of the abiotic indicators is made. Although biotic environmental indicators are rudimentary and their accuracy is influenced by external factors such as climate change, they provide climate information within the locality of the farmers. Our results suggest that the indicators used in indigenous forecasting could be incorporated in national meteorological systems in a bid to improve the accuracy of rainfall forecasts and their use among farmers and pastoralists in rural Africa.",,English,10.1175/wcas-d-19-0027.1,Open Access,,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7308,2020,"Weather, Climate, and Society",,American Meteorological Society,"Weather, Climate, and Society 12(2): 213–234",indigenous knowledge; knowledge based systems; rain; biotic factors; arable farming; climate change,Journal article

"Institutional and policy process for climate-smart agriculture: Evidence from Nagaland State, India","Patra, Nirmal K.; Babu, Suresh Chandra","A critical global policy question is how the environmental management interventions could be repurposed to meet the sustainable development goals and their target for food security, climate protection, and environmental sustainability. A common challenge facing food systems in developing countries is to improve agricultural productivity to ensure food security for all without increasing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from agriculture. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) approaches help to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture and address the challenges of climate change (CC) and food insecurity. Yet, CSA lack understanding of the institutional arrangements and policy processes. This paper examines 38 aspects to assess the institutional and policy status for CC mitigation and adaptation and CSA in Nagaland, India. Furthermore, we use these aspects to develop a scale to measure the policy and institutional environment for mitigation and adaptation of CC and implementation of CSA. Nagaland is relatively in a better position in nine aspects, although it can improve. Methodologically, the scale developed in this paper and the identified factors can help study the institutional and policy status of a country, state, or region. We identify several implications for understanding CC and CSA institutions and policies for informing policy research and practice.",Indian Council of Agricultural Research,English,10.2166/wcc.2022.024,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8518,2023,Journal of Water & Climate Change,2040-2244,IWA Publishing,Journal of Water & Climate Change 14(1),policies; environmental management; interventions; sustainable development goals; food security; climate change; environmental sustainability; food systems; developing countries;  agricultural productivity; food security; greenhouse gas emissions; agriculture; climate-smart agriculture,Journal article

"Introduction to the special issue “Scaling up of agroforestry innovations: Enhancing food, nutrition and income security”","Seghieri, Josiane; Droy, Isabelle; Hadgu, Kiros; Place, Frank","It is more and more acknowledged that agroecological innovations, such as agroforestry practices, should be co-created through a combination of research and traditional knowledge, be context adaptable, and meet the needs of producers and consumers. The word “innovation” recognises that agroforestry practices do exist everywhere in the world. However, to be able to effectively respond to global challenges and changes (demography and social changes, climate, local to international markets), speaking about ""innovations"" implies that these practices could be improved or transformed or reintroduced everywhere they had disappeared or are in decline. This reality is still current despite the significant number of research and innovation programmes, the volume of mobilized funds and the number of participating organizations. Increasing adoption of agroforestry practices also requires long term planning and coordination because trees’ life cycles are often longer than human life. This special issue includes papers on some agroforestry innovations that merit consideration for scaling up, on successful experiences that answer priorities expressed by stakeholders while taking into account their constraints, and on systemic approaches and frameworks to the development of more comprehensive perspectives on scaling up.",,English,10.1007/s10457-021-00689-5,Free Access,,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7998,2021,Agroforestry Systems,0167-4366,Springer,Agroforestry Systems 95(7): 1245-1249,climate change; climate change adaptation; agroecology; resilience; sustainable development; sustainability; livelihoods; innovation; co-created innovative practices; livelihoods improvement,Journal article
"Irrigation, risk aversion, and water right priority under water supply uncertainty","Li, Man; Xu, Wenchao; Rosegrant, Mark W.","This paper explores the impacts of a water right's allocative priority—as an indicator of farmers' risk-bearing ability—on land irrigation under water supply uncertainty. We develop and use an economic model to simulate farmers' land irrigation decision and associated economic returns in eastern Idaho. Results indicate that the optimal acreage of land irrigated increases with water right priority when hydroclimate risk exhibits a negatively skewed or right-truncated distribution. Simulation results suggest that prior appropriation enables senior water rights holders to allocate a higher proportion of their land to irrigation, 6 times as much as junior rights holders do, creating a gap in the annual expected net revenue reaching up to $141.4 acre−1 or $55,800 per farm between the two groups.",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China,English,10.1002/2016wr019779,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/5940,2017,Water Resources Research,,,Water Resources Research 53(9): 7885-7903,water availability; water rights; irrigation; water management; agricultural economics; climate change; institutional water sharing arrangements,Journal article

Key determinants of global land-use projections,"Stehfest, Elke; van Zeist, Willem-Jan; Valin, Hugo; Havlik, Petr; Popp, Alexander; Mason-D’Croz, Daniel; Wiebe, Keith D.","Land use is at the core of various sustainable development goals. Long-term climate foresight studies have structured their recent analyses around five socio-economic pathways (SSPs), with consistent storylines of future macroeconomic and societal developments; however, model quantification of these scenarios shows substantial heterogeneity in land-use projections. Here we build on a recently developed sensitivity approach to identify how future land use depends on six distinct socio-economic drivers (population, wealth, consumption preferences, agricultural productivity, land-use regulation, and trade) and their interactions. Spread across models arises mostly from diverging sensitivities to long-term drivers and from various representations of land-use regulation and trade, calling for reconciliation efforts and more empirical research. Most influential determinants for future cropland and pasture extent are population and agricultural efficiency. Furthermore, land-use regulation and consumption changes can play a key role in reducing both land use and food-security risks, and need to be central elements in sustainable development strategies.",Ministry of Environment of Japan; European Commission,English,10.1038/s41467-019-09945-w,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6664,2019,Nature Communications,2041-1723,,Nature Communications 10: 2166,land use; farmland; pastures; trade; agricultural productivity; commodities; food security; climate change; technological changes;  economic development; prices; land-use projections; land-use regulation; food demand; agriculture production; impact model,Journal article

Maximizing nutrition in key food value chains of Mongolia under climate change,"Dagys, Kadirbyek; Bakyei, Agipar; Tsolmon, Soninkhishig; Ringler, Claudia; Bellisario, Kristen; Fanzo, Jessica","Mongolia’s projected warming is far above the global average and could exceed 5 °C by the end of the century. The reliance on pastoral livestock and rainfed agriculture along with its fragile ecosystems put Mongolia’s economy at risk of adverse climate change impacts, particularly from climate extreme events. Eighty percent of Mongolia’s agricultural sector is concentrated in animal husbandry with around one third of the population relying on this livelihood. Beyond livestock, food production is concentrated in few crops: wheat; potatoes; and three vegetables (cabbage, carrot, and turnip). Climate change does not only affect food production but can exacerbate malnutrition by removing food and nutrients in all stages of the food value chain. To identify perceived effects of climate change and measures to reduce climate change impacts in Mongolia's’s key food value chains, we implemented focus group discussions with 214 livestock and vegetable producers, traders, and food consumers. We also conducted 30 key informant interviews at the soum, provincial, and national levels across four agroecosystems in three provinces. Based on this community engagement analysis, we identify interventions that the government and private sector, including herders and farmers, should undertake to increase the food security and nutrition of the country’s prioritized food value chains under climate change.",UNICEF; United Nations; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),English,10.1016/j.foodpol.2023.102468,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8701,2023,Food Policy,0306-9192 0306-9192,Elsevier,Food Policy 117(May 2023): 102468,agriculture; climate change; climate change mitigation; economic aspects; ecosystems; foods; global warming; livestock; nutrition; potatoes; research; value chains; wheat,Journal article

Migration towards Bangladesh coastlines projected to increase with sea-level rise through 2100,"Bell, Andrew Reid; Wrathall, David J.; Mueller, Valerie; Chen, Joyce; Oppenheimer, Michael","To date, projections of human migration induced by sea-level change (SLC) largely suggest large-scale displacement away from vulnerable coastlines. However, results from our model of Bangladesh suggest counterintuitively that people will continue to migrate toward the vulnerable coastline irrespective of the flooding amplified by future SLC under all emissions scenarios until the end of this century. We developed an empirically calibrated agent-based model of household migration decision-making that captures the multi-faceted push, pull and mooring influences on migration at a household scale. We then exposed ~4,800,000 simulated migrants to 871 scenarios of projected 21st-century coastal flooding under future emissions pathways. Our model does not predict flooding impacts great enough to drive populations away from coastlines in any of the scenarios. One reason is that while flooding does accelerate a transition from agricultural to non-agricultural income opportunities, livelihood alternatives are most abundant in coastal cities. At the same time, some coastal populations are unable to migrate, as flood losses accumulate and reduce the set of livelihood alternatives (so-called ""trapped"" populations). However, even when we increased access to credit, a commonly-proposed policy lever for incentivizing migration in the face of climate risk, we found that the number of immobile agents actually rose. These findings imply that instead of a straightforward relationship between displacement and migration, projections need to consider the multiple constraints on, and preferences for, mobility. Our model demonstrates that decision-makers seeking to affect migration outcomes around SLC would do well to consider individual-level adaptive behaviors and motivations that evolve through time, as well as the potential for unintended behavioral responses.",National Socioenvironmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC),English,10.1088/1748-9326/abdc5b,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7623,2021,Environmental Research Letters,1748-9326,IOP Publishing Ltd.,Environmental Research Letters 16(2): 024045,migration; climate; climate change; sea level; coastal zones; forecasting; sea level changes,Journal article

Modeling the potential impacts of climate change and adaptation strategies on groundnut production in India,"Kadiyala, M. D. M.; Nedumaran, Swamikannu; Padmanabhan, Jyosthnaa; Gumma, Murali Krishna; Gummadi, Sridhar; Robertson, Richard","Groundnut is one of the significant sources of oil, food, and fodder in India. It is grown in marginal arid and semi-arid agro-ecosystems with wide yield fluctuations due to spatial variability of rainfall and soil. Climate change, which is predicted to increase the intra- and inter-annual rainfall variability will further constrain the groundnut economy in India besides the global and domestic economic, social and policy changes. Through this study we aim to examine the biophysical and social economic impacts of climate change on groundnut production and prices to provide a comprehensive analysis of how agriculture and the food system will be affected. Using projected climate data for India, we estimated the biophysical impacts of climate change on groundnut during mid-century using representative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5) scenario. We examined the impacts of changes in population and income besides environmental factors on groundnut productivity. This is to highlight the importance of holistic assessment of biophysical and socioeconomic factors to better understand climate change impacts. Modelled projections show that by 2050, climate change under an optimistic scenario will result in -2.3 to 43.2 percent change in groundnut yields across various regions in India when climate alone was factored in. But the change in groundnut yields ranged from -0.9 percent to 16.2 percent when economic (population and income) and market variables (elasticities, trade, etc.) were also considered. Similarly, under pessimistic climate change scenario, the percent change in groundnut yields would be -33.7 to 3.4 with only the climate factored in and -11.2 to 4.3 with the additional economic and market variables included. This indicates the sensitivity of climate change impacts to differences in socioeconomic factors. This study highlights the need to take into account market effects to gain a holistic understanding of how economic and environmental factors impact agricultural food systems and economies.",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,English,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145996,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7648,2021,Science of The Total Environment,0048-9697,Elsevier,Science of The Total Environment 776(1 July 2021): 145996,climate change; modelling; groundnuts; adaptation; spatial analysis; models; prices; commodities; trade; decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (dssat); spatial modelling; spatial modeling; impact model,Journal article

More than a safety net: Ethiopia’s flagship public works program increases tree cover,"Hirvonen, Kalle; Machado, Elia A.; Simons, Andrew M.; Taraz, Vis","More than one billion people worldwide receive cash or in-kind transfers from social protection programs. In low-income countries, these transfers are often conditioned on participation in labor-intensive public works to rehabilitate local infrastructure or natural resources. Despite their popularity, the environmental impacts of public works programs remain largely undocumented. We quantify the impact on tree cover of Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), one of the world’s largest and longest-running public works programs, using satellite-based data of tree cover combined with difference-in-differences and inverse probability treatment weighting methodologies. We find that the PSNP increased tree cover by 3.8% between 2005 and 2019, with larger increases in less densely populated areas and on steep-sloped terrain. As increasing tree cover is considered an important strategy to mitigate global warming, our results suggest a win–win potential for social safety net programs with an environmental component.",,English,10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.102549,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8281,2022,Global Environmental Change,0959-3780,Elsevier,Global Environmental Change 75(July 2022): 102549,social safety nets; public works; canopy; programmes; food security; poverty; environmental impact assessment; remote sensing; climate change mitigation; climate change; climate change adaptation; difference-in-differences; modis vcf,Journal article

The influences of these major drivers can only be identified by analyzing long-term data. This study examines panel data on land use, adoption of genetically modified Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insect-resistant cotton, weather, pest severity, and insecticide use on three major cotton pests for 51 counties in China during 1991–2015. Bt cotton had pervasive effects on the whole pest complex in cotton and its management. Adoption resulted in major reductions in insecticide use for bollworm control. The resulting restoration of aphid biological control decreased aphid severity. However, mirid bugs, which have few effective natural enemies in cotton, increased in severity with warming May and reduced insecticide spraying against bollworm. The effects of landscape on pest severity were pest specific. The severity of cotton aphid and mirid bugs decreased with higher land use diversity, but the severity of highly polyphagous cotton bollworm was unrelated to land use diversity. Shares of forest, water body, and unused land area were negatively associated with the severity of mirid bugs, whereas cotton bollworm responded positively to the shares of water body and unused land area. Farmers sprayed insecticides at mild infestation levels and responded aggressively to severe bollworm outbreaks. Findings support the usefulness of Bt-based plant resistance as a component of integrated pest management (IPM) but highlight the potential for unexpected outcomes resulting from agro-ecosystem feedback loops as well as the importance of climate.",Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation Programme of the United Kingdom (Award NE/I004335/1); External Cooperation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant GJHZ1312); National Program on Key Basic Research Project of China (Grant 2012CB955700);  National Natural Science Funds of China (Grants 31621064 and 71225005); Chinese Academy of Sciences,English,10.1073/pnas.1721436115,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6285,2018,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,National Academy of Sciences,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 115(33): E7700-E7709,climate change; land use; integrated pest management; agricultural technologies; cotton; weather; pest insects; insecticides; agriculture; bt-cotton; insecticide use; agricultural technologies,Journal article

"Predicting high-magnitude, low-frequency crop losses using machine learning: An application to cereal crops in Ethiopia","Mann, Michael L.; Warner, James M.; Malik, Arun S.","Timely and accurate agricultural impact assessments for droughts are critical for designing appropriate interventions and policy. These assessments are often ad hoc, late, or spatially imprecise, with reporting at the zonal or regional level. This is problematic as we find substantial variability in losses at the village-level, which is missing when reporting at the zonal level. In this paper, we propose a new data fusion method—combining remotely sensed data with agricultural survey data—that might address these limitations. We apply the method to Ethiopia, which is regularly hit by droughts and is a substantial recipient of ad hoc imported food aid. We then utilize remotely sensed data obtained near mid-season to predict substantial crop losses of greater than or equal to 25% due to drought at the village level for five primary cereal crops. We train machine learning models to predict the likelihood of losses and explore the most influential variables. On independent samples, the models identify substantial drought loss cases with up to 81% accuracy by mid- to late-September. We believe the proposed models could be used to help monitor and predict yields for disaster response teams and policy makers, particularly with further development of the models and integration of soon-to-be available high-resolution, remotely sensed data such as the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (HLS) data set.","United States Agency for International Development USAID; Department for International Development, DfID; European Commission",English,10.1007/s10584-019-02432-7,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6651,2019,Climatic Change,0165-0009,Springer,Climatic Change 154(1-2): 211–227,crop losses; agriculture; drought; machine learning; climate change; forecasting; cereal crops; forecasting agricultural losses,Journal article
Price predictors in an extended hedonic regression framework: An application to wholesale cattle markets in Ethiopia,"Bachewe, Fantu Nisrane; Headey, Derek D.; Minten, Bart","Livestock markets influence income generation for producers, but also accessibility and affordability of highly nutritious animal-sourced foods for consumers. Despite their importance, the functioning of livestock markets in lower-income countries is poorly understood and rarely studied compared to more developed countries. This study analyzes wholesale cattle markets in Ethiopia using a uniquely rich large-scale dataset covering both prices and cattle characteristics in 39 markets (in both highland and lowland areas) over a 10-year period, and hedonic regression models structured to understand both cattle price formation and seasonal and secular price dynamics. We show that cattle prices are influenced by a wide range of factors, including proxies for meat quality, religious fasting practices, climate-based seasonality but also climate shocks and availability of grazing land, competition from animal traction services, and rising consumer incomes.

Proceedings of a workshop on characterizing and defining the social and economic domains of sustainable diets,"Comerford, Kevin; Arndt, Channing; Drewnowski, Adam; Ericksen, Polly; Griffin, Timothy; Hendrickson, Mary; Ingram, John; Nicholls, Jill","Global challenges associated with a growing demand for food in the face of finite natural resources and climate change have prompted concerns about the sustainability of our current food systems. As formulated by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the four principal domains of sustainable diets are health, economics, society, and the environment. While emphasizing the environmental cost and health impacts of current diets, the research literature has virtually ignored the vital economic and social aspects of sustainability. Without these components, critical inputs for decision-making about global challenges related to climate change and a growing demand for food are missing. National Dairy Council convened experts in sociology, economics, human nutrition, food systems science, food security, environmental health, and sustainable agriculture for a one-day workshop to define the social and economic domains of sustainability in service of better characterizing food-based dietary guidance that is both healthy and sustainable. The consensus recommendations were to (1) select social and economic indicators to complement the existing environmental and health ones, (2) better define appropriate concepts, terms, and measures to foster discussion across scientific disciplines, (3) reframe the focus on sustainable diets towards the goal of “achieving healthy dietary patterns from sustainable food systems”, and (4) complement the four domains, and incorporate the notions of geography, time, and cross-cutting considerations into sustainability frameworks. This publication summarizes the presentations, discussions, and findings from the 2019 workshop, and aims to catalyze further action to advance sustainability research and practice in the context of food-based dietary guidance and the Sustainable Development Goals.",National Dairy Council,English,10.3390/su12104163,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7232,2020,Sustainability,2071-1050,MDPI,Sustainability 12(10): 4163,sustainability; diets; natural resources; climate; climate change; food systems; sustainable diets; sustainable food systems; social domain; economic domain,Journal article

Public investment in agri-food system innovation for sustainable development,"Stads, Gert-Jan; Nin-Pratt, Alejandro; Wiebe, Keith D.; Sulser, Timothy B.; Benfica, Rui","Research is essential for improvement of agricultural productivity, resource use and resilience, and for food systems transformation more broadly. This article analyzes the drivers of past agricultural productivity growth in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and argues that productivity is not growing fast enough to meet the needs of a global population of 10 billion by 2050. A sustainable transformation of agri-food systems in LMICs will need greater and faster technical change. Higher investment in agri-food R&D is therefore needed to accelerate productivity growth and address the social, economic, nutritional and environmental challenges facing LMICs. Greater and better-targeted investment in sustainable technologies and climate change mitigation and adaptation will be particularly important to reducing the climate change impacts on agriculture and food security in the coming decades. However, LMICs with small research systems and limited innovation capacity lack the scale and resources to effectively tackle the challenges ahead. Better coordination and a clear articulation of roles and responsibilities among national, subregional, regional and global R&D actors (both from the public and private sectors) are essential to ensuring that scarce financial, human, and infrastructure resources are optimized, duplications minimized, and synergies and complementarities enhanced.",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Inter-American Development Bank,English,10.15302/j-fase-2023484,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8649,2023,Frontiers of Agricultural Science and Engineering,2095-7505,Higher Education Press,Frontiers of Agricultural Science and Engineering 10(1): 123-134,agriculture; agricultural productivity; agrifood sector; climate change mitigation; food security; infrastructure; nutrition; productivity; resilience; food systems; agrifood systems; sustainable development; innovation; research; low- and middle-income countries (lmics),Journal article

The complexity of causation, as well as the myriad ways that an event, or a sequence of events, creates cascading and systemic impacts, poses significant challenges to food systems research and policy alike. To identify priority food security risks and research opportunities, we asked experts from a range of fields and geographies to describe key threats to global food security over the next two decades and to suggest key research questions and gaps on this topic. Here, we present a prioritization of threats to global food security from extreme events, as well as emerging research questions that highlight the conceptual and practical challenges that exist in designing, adopting, and governing resilient food systems.

Rice production and climate change in Northeast China: evidence of adaptation through land use shifts,"Hu, Yanan; Fan, Lingling; Liu, Zhenhuan; Yu, Qiangyi; Liang, Shefang; Chen, Shi; You, Liangzhi; Wu, Wenbin; Yang, Peng","Climate change continues to have a great impact on rice production in China, especially in Northeast China (NEC). Historical climate observations from the China Meteorological Administration and statistical agricultural records at the county level were utilized to evaluate the spatial and temporal effects of both climatic and socioeconomic factors on rice production between 1980 and 2010 in NEC by using a linear regression model. The results showed that a 1% increase in the rice accumulated temperature (RAT) significantly increases rice production by approximately 0.728%. Rising RAT over the past three decades increased rice production by 4.44% (equal to a relative contribution of 0.87% to production growth) in NEC, while the majority of rice production growth (79.6%) resulted from increased agricultural inputs. Furthermore, rice production has increased significantly since 2000, and its geographic centroid shifted over 320 km northeastward during the past 30 years. Historical statistical and simulated rice production data for each county were used to quantify the spatial relocation of rice production due to single climatic factors. During 1980-2010, temperature had a significant and coherent influence on moving rice production. The impact of growing season precipitation was not significant, while sunshine had a significant but less spatially coherent influence. Our findings highlight the response of the rice production system to external driving factors, both climate and socioeconomics, to target further research and provide important insights into how a rice cropping system is likely to adapt in a mid-high-latitude region in the future.",National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Key Research and Development Program of China; Ministry of Finance (China),English,10.1088/1748-9326/aafa55,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6535,2019,Environmental Research Letters,1748-9326,,Environmental Research Letters 14(2),global warming; rice; production; production functions; climate change; land use; spatial data; rice relocation; northeast china,Journal article

Rural transformation and the future of cereal-based agri-food systems,"Kruseman, Gideon; Mottaleb, Khondoker Abdul; Tesfaye, Kindie; Bairagi, Subir; Robertson, Richard D.; Mandiaye, Diagne","Rural transformation is an inevitable and fundamental process of development. However, the speed and dimensions of rural transformation can affect investments in major staples such as maize, wheat and rice, which continue to play an important role in agri-food systems around the globe. This paper investigates the impacts of rural transformation on the future of cereal-based agri-food systems which are not directly addressed in global agricultural assessment models such as IMPACT. In this study, we present several key cases of major cereal systems undergoing different changes as a result of rural transformation processes across the major cereal baskets. We place these case studies in the perspective of IMPACT model scenario study results. Our study shows that the rural transformations that are taking place in different regions are heterogeneous with different impacts on the investment requirements for research and development (R&D) in the major cereals. It is concluded that although results of global agricultural assessment models such as IMPACT show initial large-scale effects on food system interactions, an iterative approach with more focused analyses on the complexities of rural transformation is needed to fine-tune results and place them in perspective.",,English,10.1016/j.gfs.2020.100441,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7458,2020,Global Food Security,2211-9124,Elsevier,Global Food Security 26(September 2020): 100441,rural areas; cereals; agrifood systems; food systems; food security; climate change; technological changes; economic development; prices; nutrition; models; maize; wheat; rice; impact model; foresight; rural transformation; investment scenarios,Journal article

Sex-disaggregated agricultural extension and weather variability in Africa south of the Sahara,"Azzarri, Carlo; Nico, Gianluigi","Climate change and extreme weather shocks pose serious threats to a number of agricultural outcomes, including agricultural production, productivity, and income, especially when households depend heavily on this activity. Agricultural extension and rural advisory services are key instruments in promoting technical change, advancing agricultural productivity growth and, ultimately, improving farm livelihoods, and are expected to mitigate the negative effects of climate change and extreme weather shocks. Their mitigation effects, however, may vary depending on the sex of the recipient. This paper investigates the role of sex-disaggregated agricultural extension recipients in contexts where agricultural performance of farm households is affected by weather variability. To this aim, we match multiple rounds of panel microdata from the nationally representative, consumption-based Living Standards Measurement Study -Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA), collected in four sub-Saharan African countries, with remote sensing data on biophysical dimensions over a long-term horizon as well as year-specific weather shocks. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a micro-level dataset with individual-level information on agricultural extension services’ recipients has been assembled and examined to investigate the effects of extreme weather shocks and climate change. Applying panel data econometric estimators, the study finds that agricultural extension and advisory services translate into higher agricultural performance of farm households where women are also among the beneficiaries, as compared to non-beneficiaries and households where beneficiaries are men only. Moreover, these services can mitigate the negative effects of weather variability and climate change, controlling for country and time fixed effects as well as holding all other variables constant. These results call for national and international policies and interventions strengthening rural advisory services, especially targeted to women in settings where household livelihoods are predominantly agriculture-based and weather variability and shocks are expected to negatively affect farming activities.",United States Agency for International Development USAID; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,English,10.1016/j.worlddev.2022.105897,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8188,2022,World Development,0305-750X,Elsevier,World Development 155(July 2022): 105897,agricultural extension; weather; weather data; sex-disaggregated data; remote sensing; gender; women; farm income,Journal article

Stressors and resilience within the cassava value chain in Nigeria: Preferred cassava variety traits and response strategies of men and women to inform breeding,"Olaosebikan, Olamide; Bello, Abolore; Utoblo, Obaiya; Okoye, Benjamin; Olutegbe, Nathaniel; Garner, Elisabeth; Teeken, Bela; Bryan, Elizabeth; Forsythe, Lora; Cole, Steven; Kulakow, Peter; Egesi, Chiedozie; Tufan, Hale; Madu, Tessy","This study investigated the trait preferences for cassava in the context of climate change and conflict stressors among value-chain actors in Nigeria to strengthen social inclusion and the community-resilience outcomes from breeding programs. Multi-stage sampling procedures were used to select and interview male and female value-chain participants in the Osun, Benue and Abia States. The results indicated that farmers preferred cassava traits such as drought tolerance, early bulking, multiple-product use and in-ground storability to strengthen resilience. Climate change and challenges related to social change shaped the response strategies from both genders, and influenced trait preferences, including the early re-emergence of cassava leaves, stems that had ratooning potential, and especially the root milking that was important among female respondents. The major response strategies employed by men included frequent farm visits to prevent theft and engaging in non-agricultural livelihoods. Those employed by women included backyard farming, early harvesting, having preferences for food with fewer processing steps, and depending on remittances. The resilience capacity was higher for men than for women due to their better access to assets, as well as their abilities to relocate their farms and out-migrate in search of other livelihoods. Considering gendered cassava traits, and enhancing their resilience and response strategies, can complement efforts to make breeding more socially inclusive, resilient, and anticipatory to future challenges created by climate and related social changes.",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,English,10.3390/su15107837,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8947,2023,Sustainability,2071-1050,MDPI,Sustainability 15(10): 7837,breeding; cassava; climate change; conflicts; gender; value chains; resilience; farmers; livelihoods; trait preferences; response strategies; gender disparity,Journal article

Recent research suggests that the envisioned negative effects are not inevitable and that benefits such as improved food security can be enhanced. Targeted investments to the livestock sector could help make these happen. We use scenario analysis to explore this question, assessing the impacts of selected investment options in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Our results show that boosting livestock productivity primarily in these two regions could improve food security and producer incomes while limiting greenhouse gas emissions and agricultural water usage.

Synchronous crop failures and climate-forced production variability,"Anderson, W. B.; Seager, R.; Baethgen, W.; Cane, M.; You, Liangzhi","Large-scale modes of climate variability can force widespread crop yield anomalies and are therefore often presented as a risk to food security. We quantify how modes of climate variability contribute to crop production variance. We find that the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), tropical Atlantic variability (TAV), and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) together account for 18, 7, and 6% of globally aggregated maize, soybean, and wheat production variability, respectively. The lower fractions of global-scale soybean and wheat production variability result from substantial but offsetting climate-forced production anomalies.

Techlex: A corporate practice to initiate inclusive agri-food value chain development in China,"Zhou, Yunyi; Hu, Song; Chen, Kevin Z.","A tradeoff lies between inclusiveness and economic efficiency in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals such as poverty reduction, food security, and climate resilience. Vertical coordination between agribusinesses and farmers, in tandem with corporate social responsibility, has been perceived as an approach to surmount such tradeoff from a micro perspective. In a localized context of developing economies, the vertical coordination with farmers is reducible to a path for agribusinesses towards inclusive local value chain development (LVCD) at the grassroots level. However, few models are documented for agribusiness managers to refer to in practice. This study harnesses the Techlex Group and its pig business as a case, zooming in on the vertical coordination of agribusiness and vulnerable smallholders in lagging rural areas of China. Based on an overview of China’s pig industry and Techlex’s value chain, this study highlights three inclusive models and their alternatives for the LVCD. Though proffered in the Chinese context, those models can enrich the LVCD toolkit and be attuned to fit a different scenario.",Zhejiang University,English,10.22434/ifamr2021.0097,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8482,2023,International Food and Agribusiness Management Review,1559-2448,Wageningen Academic Publishers,International Food and Agribusiness Management Review 26(2): 355-371,economic conditions; sustainable development goals; agriculture; agro-industrial sector; farmers; poverty reduction; food security; climate change adaptation; corporations; developing economies; value chains; swine; contract farming; climate resilience; local value chain development (lvcd); pigs; vertical coordination,Journal article
Temporary migration and climate variation in Eastern Africa,"Mueller, Valerie; Sheriff, Glenn; Dou, Xiaoya; Gray, Clark","Africa is likely to experience warming and increased climate variability by the late 21st century. Climate extremes have been linked to adverse economic outcomes. Hence, adaptation is a key component of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreements and development assistance. Effective climate adaptation policy requires an understanding of how temperature and rainfall variability affect migration patterns. Yet, how individuals in developing countries manage climate variation is poorly understood, especially in Africa. Combining high-resolution climate data with panel micro-data on migration, labor participation, and demographics, we employ regression analysis to assess temporary migration responses to local temperature and precipitation anomalies in four East African countries. We find that climate impacts are most pronounced in urban areas, with a standard deviation temperature increase and rainfall decrease leading to respective 10 and 12 percent declines in out-migration relative to mean values. Evidence from other labor market outcomes suggests that urban out-migration is not associated with reduced local employment opportunities. Instead, declines in urban out-migration appear to coincide with negative local climate employment impacts. These results challenge the narrative that temporary out-migration serves as a safety valve during climate extremes and that climate change will most strongly affect out-migration rates from rural areas in developing countries.",,English,10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104704,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6989,2020,World Development,0305-750X,Elsevier,World Development 126(February 2020): 104704,migration; climate; climate change; climate change adaptation; work force; labour market; rural urban migration; urban rural migration; climate-induced migration; temporary migration,Journal article

The changing nature of hydroclimatic risks across South Africa,"Schlosser, Adam; Sokolov, Andrei; Strzepek Ken; Thomas, Timothy S.; Gao, Xiang; Arndt, Channing","We present results from large ensembles of projected twenty-first century changes in seasonal precipitation and near-surface air temperature for the nation of South Africa. These ensembles are a result of combining Monte Carlo projections from a human-Earth system model of intermediate complexity with pattern-scaled responses from climate models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). These future ensemble scenarios consider a range of global actions to abate emissions through the twenty-first century. We evaluate distributions of surface-air temperature and precipitation change over three sub-national regions: western, central, and eastern South Africa. In all regions, we find that without any emissions or climate targets in place, there is a greater than 50% likelihood that mid-century temperatures will increase threefold over the current climate’s two-standard deviation range of variability. However, scenarios that consider more aggressive climate targets all but eliminate the risk of these salient temperature increases. A preponderance of risk toward decreased precipitation (3 to 4 times higher than increased) exists for western and central South Africa. Strong climate targets abate evolving regional hydroclimatic risks. Under a target to limit global climate warming to 1.5 °C by 2100, the risk of precipitation changes within South Africa toward the end of this century (2065–2074) is commensurate to the risk during the 2030s without any global climate target. Thus, these regional hydroclimate risks over South Africa could be delayed by 30 years and, in doing so, provide invaluable lead-time for national efforts to prepare, fortify, and/or adapt.",Massachusetts Institute of Technology; U.S. Department of Energy; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Electric Power Research Institute; National Treasury of the Republic of South Africa,English,10.1007/s10584-021-03235-5,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7997,2021,Climatic Change,0165-0009,Springer,Climatic Change 168: 28,climate change; climate change mitigation; risk; precipitation; temperature; hydroclimatology; modelling; seasonality; mit earth systems model (mesm); coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (cmip5); seasonal precipitation; hydroclimatic risks,Journal article
The crucial role of domestic and international market-mediated adaptation to climate change,"Gouel, Christophe; Laborde Debucquet, David","Climate change effects on agricultural yields will be uneven over the world. A few countries, mostly in high latitudes, may experience gains, while most will see average yield decrease. This paper aims to quantify the role of market-mediated adjustments in attenuating the effects of climate change by allowing the expression of the new climate-induced pattern of comparative advantages within and between countries. To do this, we develop a quantitative general equilibrium trade model where the representation of land use choice is inspired from modern Ricardian trade models. We use spatially explicit information from the agronomic literature about potential yields before and after climate change for calibration and counterfactual simulations. The results show that the climate-induced yield changes generate large price movements that incentivize adjustments in production and trade. Both production and trade adjustments contribute to reducing welfare losses globally, with production adjustments making the larger contribution.",INRA-Cirad métaprogramme GloFoodS; CLAND Convergence Institute,English,10.1016/j.jeem.2020.102408,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7606,2021,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management,0095-0696,Elsevier,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management 106(March 2021): 102408,agriculture; climate change; trade; land use; international trade; adaptation; crop production; models; market-mediated adjustments; equilibrium trade model,Journal article

Although a relatively rich body of literature that investigates localized experiences, geophysical, and socioeconomic drivers of land degradation, and the costs and benefits of avoiding land degradation already exists, less rigorously explored are the global effects of restoring degraded landscapes for the health of the land, the climate, and world food security. The current scale of land degradation is such that the problem can be meaningfully addressed only if local successes are upscaled and a large number of landowners and land managers implement restoration activities. Significant global efforts to address degradation exist, but studies that evaluate the global benefits of these efforts generally do not account for global market forces and the complex web of relationships that determine the effects of wide-scale restoration on production and food security. This paper provides important insights into how a full integration of crop production in restoration efforts could impact food production levels, food availability, forest carbon stocks, and Greenhouse gas emissions.","Department for International Development, DfID",English,10.3389/fsufs.2020.00061,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7229,2020,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,2571-581X,Frontiers,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems 4: 61,land degradation; climate change; forest landscape restoration; food security; crop production; bonn challenge,Journal article
"The role of risk in the context of climate change, land use choices and crop production: Evidence from Zambia","De Pinto, Alessandro; Smith, Vincent H.; Robertson, Richard D.","Most of the studies that investigate the impacts of climate change on agriculture have concentrated on the effects of changes in mean temperature and precipitation even though the importance of volatility and risk on farmers’ decision making is well documented. This study examines the empirical importance of the effects of risk associated with the impacts of climate change on farm land allocations and consequent effects on agricultural output in Zambia. We used a discrete-choice model consistent with a mean-variance utility function to model farm-level land allocations among alternative crops. Results indicate that risk-reducing decisions can reinforce crop shifts driven by climate change impacts on mean temperature and precipitation. While an analysis of the available per-capita daily nutrients reveals that farmers’ crop allocation choices can mitigate the negative effects of climate change, the opportunity cost of these decisions is explored through a simulation scenario in which yield variability is reduced to zero. Reduction of yield variability leads to land allocations that result in a sizable increase in total crop production and a significant increase in available per capita daily calories. Important conclusions can be derived from this analysis. First, the risk environment matters and should not be ignored. When the economic effects of climate change are considered, decision making under uncertainty and risk should be at the forefront of the problems that need to be addressed. Second, concentrating on farm-level effects of responses to climate change is not sufficient. To understand the economy-wide consequences of climate change, the aggregate effects of individual decisions should be assessed. Third, results indicate that increased efforts in risk management and in developing policies aimed at reducing risk can lead to significant positive outcomes for the nutritional status of low-income, food-insecure populations.",United States Agency for International Development USAID,English,10.3354/cr01581,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6913,2019,Climate Research,0936-577X,Inter-Research Science Publisher,Climate Research 79(1): 39-53,risk; climate change; land use; crop production; agriculture; climate change mitigation; volatility; land use change; farmland crop allocation,Journal article

Through a dense network of on-farm surveys for the rice–wheat system in this region, we show that contemporary wheat sowing dates have a central influence on achieved and attainable yields, superseding all other crop management, soil and varietal factors. We estimate that untapped wheat production potential will increase by 69% with achievable adjustments to wheat sowing dates without incurring undesirable trade-offs with rice productivity, irrigation requirements or profitability. Our findings also indicate that transformative gains in wheat yields are only possible in eastern India if rice and wheat are managed as a coupled system.

"Trade, policy, and food security","Smith, Vincent H.; Glauber, Joseph W.","Food insecurity is extensive throughout the world and hunger and malnutrition are expected to remain serious humanitarian and political concerns, both in the short term and for the foreseeable future, particularly in low income developing countries where many rural and urban households are both income and asset poor. In those countries, domestic agricultural production is expected to be especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change over the next 30 years. Thus international markets for staple agricultural commodities, which have become increasingly important as sources of nutrition for both developing and developed countries over the past 60 years, are likely to become even more important in the future. Free trade policies allow countries to exploit their comparative advantages in economic activity, increasing average per capita incomes, longer term growth rates and a country's capacity to fund social safety nets for the poor. However, many countries abandoned those policies in favor of domestic protections in their efforts to mitigate the effects of short run food crises. The policy challenge is therefore to resolve the tension between optimal long run policies and short run initiatives to address food security concerns.",,English,10.1111/agec.12547,Open Access,,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6952,2020,Agricultural Economics,0169-5150,International Association of Agricultural Economists (IAAE),Agricultural Economics 51(1): 159-171,trade; food security; nutrition; malnutrition; agricultural products; international trade; trade policies; climate change; developing countries; policies; poverty; agricultural production; markets; trade liberalization; agricultural commodities,Journal article

Bringing about this transformation requires inter- and transdisciplinary approaches, and the embracing of social equity. In this Perspective, we unpack what this means for agricultural research and, based on our collective experience, we map out a research agenda that weaves different research components into a holistic and transformative one.

"Treatment of organic resources before soil incorporation in semi-arid regions improves resilience to El Niño, and increases crop production and economic returns","Smith, Jo; Nayak, Dali; Albanito, Fabrizio; Balana, Bedru; Black, Helaina; Boke, Shiferaw","The use of limited organic resources to build resilience to drought in semi-arid regions was investigated using systems modelling. The study focused on Halaba in Ethiopia, drawing on biophysical and socio-economic data obtained from a survey of farms before, during and after the 2015/16 El Niño event. Using a simplified weather dataset to remove noise from weather fluctuations, a ten yearly El Niño was demonstrated to cause significant long-term degradation of soil, reducing crop yields by 9%–14% and soil carbon by 0.5%–4.1%; more frequent droughts would increase this impact. Farmers in Halaba usually apply manures to soils untreated. Counteracting the impact of El Niño on soil degradation is possible by increasing application of untreated manure, but would result in a small net cost due to loss of dung as fuel. By composting manure its recalcitrance increases, allowing soil degradation to be counteracted without cost. The best option investigated, in terms of both food and fuel security, for households with access to water and finances needed for anaerobic digestion (500–2000 US$), is to use manure to produce biogas and then apply the nutrient-rich bioslurry residue to the soil. This will result in a significant benefit of over 5000 US$ per decade from increased crop production and saved fuel costs. However, many households are limited in water and finances; in that situation, the much cheaper pyrolysis cook-stove (50 US$) can provide similar economic benefits without the need for water. The biochar residue from pyrolysis is highly recalcitrant, but pyrolysis results in loss of nutrients, so may result in lower yields than other uses of manures. This may be countered by using biochar to capture nutrients from elsewhere in the farm, such as from animal housing or compost pits; more work is needed to quantify the impact of treated biochar on crop yields.","Department for International Development, DfID; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; Natural Environment Research Council, NERC",English,10.1088/1748-9326/ab2b1b,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6968,2019,Environment Research Letters,1748-9326,"IOP Publishing, Ltd",Environmental Research Letters 14(8): 085004,resilience; soil degradation; composts; biochar; el nino; drought; climate change; fertilizers; organic fertilizers; crop production; returns; crop yield; nutrient availability (soil); organic resource use; bioslurry,Journal article

"Understanding the consequences of changes in the production frontiers for roots, tubers and bananas","Petsakos, Athanasios; Prager, Steven D.; Gonzalez, Carlos Eduardo; Gama, Arthur Chibwana; Sulser, Timothy B.","The widely recognized role of roots, tubers and bananas (RT&Bs) in achieving food security and providing income opportunities in the world’s poorest regions will be challenged by socioeconomic and climate related drivers. These will affect demand and production patterns and increase pressure on farming systems. Foresight results presented in this paper show that the importance of RT&B crops for food security will likely increase by 2050 despite these challenges. Furthermore, investments targeted at yield growth appear to be more effective than marketing improvements in alleviating production constraints and in strengthening the role of RT&B crops in future food systems.",,English,10.1016/j.gfs.2018.12.005,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6921,2019,Global Food Security,2211-9124,Elsevier,Global Food Security 20(March 2019): 180-188,bananas; tubers; roots; climate change; agricultural production; food security; investment; cassava; marketing; developing countries,Journal article

Using a large climate ensemble to assess the frequency and intensity of future extreme climate events in southern Africa,"Thomas, Timothy S.; Schlosser, C. Adam; Strzepek, Kenneth M.; Robertson, Richard D.; Arndt, Channing","This paper uses 7,200 smoothed climate change projections for each of the four emissions scenarios, together with inter-annual variation provided by detrended historical climate data to investigate changes in growing season (wettest 3 months) weather patterns from the 2020s to the 2060s for ten countries of Southern Africa. The analysis is done in 8,888 quarter-degree pixels by month. Temperature unequivocally rises in the region, but it rises relatively less along the coasts, particularly on the eastern side of the region. Precipitation has trended downward for much of the region since 1975, but relatively little change in precipitation is projected between the 2020s and the 2060s. Under the higher emissions “Paris Forever” scenario, we found that by the 2060s, the 1-in-20-year low-rainfall events will occur twice as frequently in most of the region, though it will occur less frequently in northwestern Angola. The 1-in-20-year high-rainfall events will occur 3 to 4 times as often in northeastern South Africa and twice as often in most of Angola.","National Treasury, Republic of South Africa",English,10.3389/fclim.2022.787721,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8270,2022,Frontiers in Climate,,Frontiers,Frontiers in Climate 4: 787721,extreme weather events; climate; climate change; risk; weather data; climate uncertainty,Journal article

Vulnerability of agriculture to climate change increases the risk of child malnutrition: Evidence from a large-scale observational study in India,"Mahapatra, Bidhubhusan; Walia, Monika; Rao, Chitiprolu Anantha Rama; Raju, Bellapukonda Murali Krishna; Saggurti, Niranjan","Introduction: The impact of climate change on agriculture and food security has been examined quite thoroughly by researchers globally as well as in India. While existing studies provide evidence on how climate variability affects the food security and nutrition, research examining the extent of effect vulnerability of agriculture to climate change can have on nutrition in India are scarce. This study examined a) the association between the degree of vulnerability in agriculture to climate change and child nutrition at the micro-level b) spatial effect of climate vulnerability on child nutrition, and c) the geographical hotspots of both vulnerability in agriculture to climate change and child malnutrition.
Methods: The study used an index on vulnerability of agriculture to climate change and linked it to child malnutrition indicators (stunting, wasting, underweight and anaemia) from the National Family Health Survey 4 (2015–16). Mixed-effect and spatial autoregressive models were fitted to assess the direction and strength of the relationship between vulnerability and child malnutrition at macro and micro level. Spatial analyses examined the within-district and across-district spill-over effects of climate change vulnerability on child malnutrition.
Results: Both mixed-effect and spatial autoregressive models found that the degree of vulnerability was positively associated with malnutrition among children. Children residing in districts with a very high degree of vulnerability were more like to have malnutrition than those residing in districts with very low vulnerability. The analyses found that the odds of a child suffering from stunting increased by 32%, wasting by 42%, underweight by 45%, and anaemia by 63% if the child belonged to a district categorised as very highly vulnerable when compared to those categorised as very low. The spatial analysis also suggested a high level of clustering in the spatial distribution of vulnerability and malnutrition. Hotspots of child malnutrition and degree of vulnerability were mostly found to be clustered around western-central part of India.
Conclusion: Study highlights the consequences that vulnerability of agriculture to climate change can have on child nutrition. Strategies should be developed to mitigate the effect of climate change on areas where there is a clustering of vulnerability and child malnutrition.

Weather dataset choice introduces uncertainty to estimates of crop yield responses to climate variability and change,"Parkes, Ben; Higginbottom, Thomas P.; Hufkens, Koen; Ceballos, Francisco; Kramer, Berber; Foster, Tim","Weather shocks, such as heatwaves, droughts, and excess rainfall, are a major cause of crop yield losses and food insecurity worldwide. Statistical or process-based crop models can be used to quantify how yields will respond to these events and future climate change. However, the accuracy of weather-yield relationships derived from crop models, whether statistical or process-based, is dependent on the quality of the underlying input data used to run these models. In this context, a major challenge in many developing countries is the lack of accessible and reliable meteorological datasets. Gridded weather datasets, derived from combinations of in situ gauges, remote sensing, and climate models, provide a solution to fill this gap, and have been widely used to evaluate climate impacts on agriculture in data-scarce regions worldwide. However, these reference datasets are also known to contain important biases and uncertainties. To date, there has been little research to assess how the choice of reference datasets influences projected sensitivity of crop yields to weather. We compare multiple freely available gridded datasets that provide daily weather data over the Indian sub-continent over the period 1983–2005, and explore their implications for estimates of yield responses to weather variability for key crops grown in the region (wheat and rice). Our results show that individual gridded weather datasets vary in their representation of historic spatial and temporal temperature and precipitation patterns across India. We show that these differences create large uncertainties in estimated crop yield responses and exposure to variability in growing season weather, which in turn, highlights the need for improved consideration of input data uncertainty in statistical studies that explore impacts of climate variability and change on agriculture.","Natural Environment Research Council, NERC; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; Department for International Development, DfID",English,10.1088/1748-9326/ab5ebb,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7044,2019,Environmental Research Letters,1748-9326,IOP Publishing Ltd.,Environmental Research Letters 14(12): 124089,weather data; weather; crop yield; crop performance; yields; climate change; climate; food security; crop modelling; rice; wheat; fixed effects model; picture-based crop insurance (pbi),Journal article
Welfare effects of weather variability: Multi-country evidence from Africa south of the Sahara,"Haile, Beliyou; Signorelli, Sara; Azzarri, Carlo; Johnson, Timothy","Climate change and weather variability pose serious threats to food and nutrition security as well as ecosystems, especially when livelihoods depend heavily on natural resources. This study examines the effect of weather variability (shock) occurring up to three planting and growing season prior on per capita monthly household expenditure in rural Tanzania, Uganda, and Ghana. The analyses combine monthly temperature (1950–2013) and precipitation (1981–2013) data with data from several rounds of household surveys conducted between 1998 and 2013. Substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity is documented in the incidence of shocks, with effects dependent on both the study and lag period considered. Analysis of short panel data shows the cumulative effect of above-average precipitation on expenditure to be negative in Uganda -while positive in Tanzania-, but the relationship does not persist when pooling survey data spanning over a decade. The evidence from pooled data suggests a positive association between above-average temperature (heat wave) and expenditure in (historically cooler) Uganda, with the opposite effect observed in (the relatively warmer) Tanzania. For Ghana, the association between heat wave and expenditure is positive. There is no evidence of heterogeneous effects along several dimensions, except by agro-ecological condition. Further research into the effects of shocks on more direct outcomes–such as agricultural practices, yields, and dietary intake–is therefore recommended to shed light on possible impact pathways and appropriate localized adaptation strategies.",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,English,10.1371/journal.pone.0206415,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6485,2018,PLoS ONE,,PLOS,PLoS ONE 13(11): e0206415,household expenditure; weather data; welfare; household surveys; poverty; climate change; precipitation; temperature; weather shocks,Journal article
Where women in agri-food systems are at highest climate risk: A methodology for mapping climate-agriculture-gender inequality hotspots,"Lecoutere, Els; Mishra, Avni; Singaraju, Niyati; Koo, Jawoo; Azzarri, Carlo; Chanana, Nitya; Nico, Gianluigi; Puskur, Ranjitha   ","Climate change poses a greater threat for more exposed and vulnerable countries, communities and social groups. People whose livelihood depends on the agriculture and food sector, especially in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), face significant risk. In contexts with gendered roles in agri-food systems or where structural constraints to gender equality underlie unequal access to resources and services and constrain women's agency, local climate hazards and stressors, such as droughts, floods, or shortened crop-growing seasons, tend to negatively affect women more than men and women's adaptive capacities tend to be more restrained than men's . Transformation towards just and sustainable agri-food systems in the face of climate change will not only depend on reducing but also on averting aggravated gender inequality in agri-food systems. In this paper, we developed and applied an accessible and versatile methodology to identify and map localities where climate change poses high risk especially for women in agri-food systems because of gendered exposure and vulnerability. We label these localities climate-agriculture-gender inequality hotspots. Applying our methodology to LMICs reveals that the countries at highest risk are majorly situated in Africa and Asia. Applying our methodology for agricultural activity-specific hotspot subnational areas to four focus countries, Mali, Zambia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance, identifies a cluster of districts in Dhaka and Mymensingh divisions in Bangladesh as a hotspot for rice. The relevance and urgency of identifying localities where climate change hits agri-food systems hardest and is likely to negatively affect population groups or sectors that are particularly vulnerable is increasingly acknowledged in the literature and, in the spirit of leaving no one behind, in climate and development policy arenas. Hotspot maps can guide the allocation of scarce resources to most at-risk populations. The climate-agriculture-gender inequality hotspot maps show where women involved in agri-food systems are at high climate risk while signaling that reducing this risk requires addressing the structural barriers to gender equality.",United States Agency for International Development USAID,English,10.3389/fsufs.2023.1197809,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/8913,2023,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,2571-581X,Frontiers Media S.A.,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems 7: 1197809,agriculture; agrifood systems; climate change; gender equality;  less favoured areas; livelihoods; women,Journal article
"Which practices co‐deliver food security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and combat land‐degradation and desertification?","Smith, Pete; Calvin, Katherine; Nkem, Johnson; Campbell, Donovan; Cherubini, Francesco; Nkonya, Ephraim M.","There is a clear need for transformative change in the land management and food production sectors to address the global land challenges of climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, combatting land degradation and desertification, and delivering food security (referred to hereafter as “land challenges”). We assess the potential for 40 practices to address these land challenges and find that: Nine options deliver medium to large benefits for all four land challenges. A further two options have no global estimates for adaptation, but have medium to large benefits for all other land challenges. Five options have large mitigation potential (>3 Gt CO2eq/year) without adverse impacts on the other land challenges. Five options have moderate mitigation potential, with no adverse impacts on the other land challenges. Sixteen practices have large adaptation potential (>25 million people benefit), without adverse side effects on other land challenges. Most practices can be applied without competing for available land. However, seven options could result in competition for land. A large number of practices do not require dedicated land, including several land management options, all value chain options, and all risk management options. Four options could greatly increase competition for land if applied at a large scale, though the impact is scale and context specific, highlighting the need for safeguards to ensure that expansion of land for mitigation does not impact natural systems and food security. A number of practices, such as increased food productivity, dietary change and reduced food loss and waste, can reduce demand for land conversion, thereby potentially freeing‐up land and creating opportunities for enhanced implementation of other practices, making them important components of portfolios of practices to address the combined land challenges.","UKRI; UKERC; European Commission; Wellcome Trust; UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy; Norwegian Research Council; IPCC Trust Fund",English,10.1111/gcb.14878,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/6904,2020,Global Change Biology,1354-1013,John Wiley & Sons,Global Change Biology 26(3): 1532-1575,food security; food access; climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; land degradation; desertification; land management; food production; adaptation; land management; risk management; adverse side-effects; co-benefits; demand management; mitigation; practice,Journal article

Women’s empowerment and farmland allocations in Bangladesh: Evidence of a possible pathway to crop diversification,"De Pinto, Alessandro; Seymour, Gregory; Bryan, Elizabeth; Bhandari, Prapti","Climate change will likely affect several of the dimensions that determine people’s food security status in Bangladesh, from crop production to the availability and accessibility of food products. Crop diversification is a form of adaptation to climate change that reduces exposure to climate-related risks and has also been shown to increase diet diversity, reduce micronutrient deficiencies, and positively affect agro-ecological systems. Despite these benefits, the level of crop diversification in Bangladesh remains extremely low, requiring an examination of the factors that support uptake of this practice. This paper explores whether women’s empowerment, measured using the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), leads to increased diversification in the use of farmland. Our results reveal that some aspects of women’s empowerment in agriculture, but not all, lead to more diversification and to a transition from cereal production to other crops like vegetables and fruits. These findings suggest a possible pathway for gender-sensitive interventions that promote crop diversity as a risk management tool and as a way to improve the availability of nutritious crops.",United States Agency for International Development USAID,English,10.1007/s10584-020-02925-w,Open Access,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,https://ebrary.ifpri.org/digital/collection/p15738coll5/id/7509,2020,Climatic Change,0165-0009,Springer,Climatic Change 163(2): 1025–1043,empowerment; gender; women; women's empowerment; nutrition; diversification; climate change; crops; crop diversification; women’s empowerment in agriculture index,Journal article
