Collective Action for Common Rangelands Improvement: A Climate Change Adaptation Strategy in Uzbekistan,"Christmann, Stefanie; Aw-Hassan, Aden A.; Rajabov, Toshpulat; Rabbimov, Abdullo",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; UzRI of Karakul Sheep Breeding and Desert Ecology - UzNIIKEP; Samarkand State University - SSU,"Rangeland degradation endangers livelihoods of many rural communities in Uzbekistan. Despite the threat of land deterioration from climate change, there are many reasons that land users do not take action to prevent or reduce land degradation. The described project uses a low-cost approach to mobilize stakeholders and initiate collective action. Based on a social learning process focusing on development of local climate-change scenarios, villagers from Qiziltepa district identified adaptation options and agreed on a common purpose to restore rangelands through collective governance systems. They formed pastoral user groups, established seed isles to ensure seeding of forage shrubs, and agreed on seasonal grazing. This case study shows the critical importance of scenarios in social learning processes for building awareness concerning climate change adaptation; they led to changes in perceptions and agreement on collective action and governance. We compare the potential of this integrated approach with large-scale seeding.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2014.933927,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/8326,2015-12-01,2014-09-03,Society and Natural Resources,0894-1920,Taylor &amp; Francis (Routledge): SSH Titles,28,3,280-295,climate change adaptation; collective rangeland governance; pastoral user group; seed isle; social learning process,UZ
The vulnerability of native rangeland plant species to global climate change in the West Asia and North African regions,"Ouled Belgacem, Azaiez; Louhaichi, Mounir",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,"This study aimed to evaluate the impact of climate change on the geographical
distribution of selected native species from two areas from West Asia and North Africa.
Three species representing two genera were selected for assessment of their vulnerability to
climate change. The first species was Salsola vermiculata L. which is common to both study
areas. The second genus was represented by two species, Haloxylon salicornicum (Moq.)
Bunge from the Syrian rangelands and H. schmittianum Pomel from southern Tunisia. To
assess the vulnerability of these species to climate change we used ecological-based models.
The data inputs were composed of the species occurrence data and the environmental data
which included eight climatic layers, three soil property layers in addition to an altitude
layer. Since environmental parameters only enable assessing the sensitivity of target species
to climate change, a grazing pressure layer was used to assess the species vulnerability. Only
climatic parameters were considered as changing across three periods; current situation,
2020 and 2050. The main results indicated that threatened range species, such as S.
vermiculata which were subjected to continuous grazing pressure, showed high vulnerability
to climate change as expressed by the predicted decrease in the areas of their distribution.
However, species with low palatability and broad ecological niches (i.e. H. salicornicum and
H. schmittianum) had an advantage due to the reduced competition for water and nutrients.
An adaptation strategy to increase the resilience of the most vulnerable species should
involve management of grazing pressure and the establishment of other mitigation measures",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-013-0701-z,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/7188,2013-07-02,2013-01-31,Climatic Change,0165-0009,Springer Verlag (Germany),119,2,451-463,small ruminants; grazing pressure; climatic niche; ongoing climate change; broad ecological niche,SY; TN

Towards Climate Change Preparedness in the MENA’s Agricultural Sector,"Govind, Ajit",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,"The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) represents a substantial area of the terrestrial landmass encompassing several countries and ecosystems. This area is generally drier and warmer compared to the rest of the world, and has extreme resource limitations that are highly vulnerable to a changing climate, geopolitical instability and land degradation. This paper will first identify the nature of climate change in the region by analyzing a downscaled climate data and identifying the hotspots of climate change in MENA. It was found that the climate vulnerability is quite high, with the mean annual temperature increasing by as much as 4–6 degrees towards the end of the century. The nature precipitation under climate change is quite speculative, with the Maghreb region showing the highest vulnerability. Based on these results, five action points are postulated that may be implemented to rapidly progress our understanding of climate vulnerability and enhance the climate change preparedness in MENA’s agri-food sector, to take necessary actions to adapt to a changing climate with a systemic resilience perspective. These include working towards: (1) enhancing the sustainability of the rainfed-desert transitional belt (Rangelands) in the MENA; (2) enhancing the sustainability of agri-food systems in the food baskets of MENA and (3) working towards fostering a collective intelligence to support climate change research in the MENA. (4) The need for foresight advice on resilient food systems under climate change and (5) the need for transformative policies for stabilization and reconstruction under climate change.","Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development - AFESD; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security - CCAFS",en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12020279,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/68236,,2022-01-21,Agronomy,0065-4663,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),12,2,,climate change; rangelands; resilience; middle east and north africa (mena); irrigated agriculture; rainfed agriculture; agri-food system; collective intelligence,EG
Climate change and resilient dryland systems: experiences of ICRISAT in Asia and Africa,"Jat, Ram A.; Craufurd, Peter; Sahrawat, Kanwar Lal; Wani, Suhas",International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics - ICRISAT,"The article reviews and summarizes the climate change mitigation and adaptation work undertaken by ICRISAT. The effects of climate
change are already being experienced in several parts of the world. Even though the effects of climate change will be felt over all kinds
of agricultural production systems, they will be more pronounced in dryland areas where agriculture is totally dependent on rainfall.
Simulation output analyses reveal that crop yield will decrease due to climate change and variability in drylands, but this can be
mitigated in large parts by the application of existing knowledge on crop, soil and water management, and by retargeting
and
redeployment of the existing germplasms of the crops in the medium term (2010–2050). Integrated watershed management is an
important tool to mitigate the climate change effects through soil conservation, improved water availability and other secondary
benefits. Similarly, conservation agriculture practices under the integrated genetic and natural resources management strategy can help
minimize the adverse effects of climate change on dryland agricultural productivity.",,en,,Open access,CC-BY-NC-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/5682,,2012-06-25,current science,00113891,Indian Academy of Sciences,102 (12),,1650-1659,climate change; drylands; resilience; watershed management,IN
In silico evaluation of plant genetic resources to search for traits for adaptation to climate change,"Bari, Abdallah; Khazaei, Hamid; Stoddard, Frederick L.; Street, Kenneth; Sillanpää, Mikko; Chaubey, Yogendra Prasad; Dayanandan, Selvadurai; Endresen, Dag Terje Filip; De Pauw, Eddy; Damania, Ardeshir B.","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; University of California-Davis - UC Davis; Concordia University; University of Helsinki - UoH; University of Saskatchewan, College of Agriculture and Bioresources, Crop Development Centre - USAK - AGBIO- CDC; University of Oulu; Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science; University of Oslo, Natural History Museum - UiO - NHM","Plant genetic resources display patterns resulting from ecological and co-evolutionary processes. Such patterns are instrumental in tracing the origin and diversity of crops and locating adaptive traits. With climate change and the anticipated increase in demand for food, new crop varieties will be needed to perform under unprecedented climatic conditions. In the present study, we explored genetic resources patterns to locate traits of adaptation to drought and to maximize the utilization of plant genetic resources lacking ex ante evaluation for emerging climate conditions. This approach is based on the use of mathematical models to predict traits as response variables driven by stochastic ecological and co-evolutionary processes. The high congruence of metrics between model predictions and empirical trait evaluations confirms in silico evaluation as an effective tool to manage large numbers of crop accessions lacking ex ante evaluation. This outcome will assist in developing cultivars adaptable to various climatic conditions and in the ultimate use of genetic resources to sustain agricultural productivity under conditions of climate change.","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security - CCAFS; University of Helsinki - UoH; Australian Grains Genebank - AGG; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council - NSERC - CRSNG",en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-015-1541-9,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/12383,2016-02-01,2015-11-11,Climatic Change,0165-0009,Springer (part of Springer Nature),134,4,667-680,adaptation; climate change; plant genetic resources,
Farmers’ awareness and perception of climate change impacts: case study of Aguie district in Niger,"Ado, Abdou; Leshan, Jin; Savadogo, Patrice; Bo, Li; Shah, Ashfaq",World Agroforestry Center - ICRAF; China Agricultural University - CAU China,"The agricultural sector is the main source of rural households’ food and revenue in Niger, and it contributes approximately 43% to the national GDP. However, there are several constraints to the sector’s development, including negative impacts of climate change. To mitigate these impacts, farmers implement a range of technical strategies. The extent of farmer’s awareness and perceptions of climate change impacts influences these strategies and hence farmers’ level of adaptation. This study was undertaken to assess farmers’ awareness and perceptions of climate change impacts in Aguie Department, Niger Republic. Descriptive statistics and a regression model were used for data analysis. The results from a descriptive analysis show that the majority of respondents (84.4%) were aware of climate risks, but had differing perceptions of climate change impacts on production and annual revenue. A regression test revealed that climate-related information is highly significant in determining farmers’ awareness of climate change impacts. Most of the respondents reported negative impacts from climate change, and the majority, therefore, adjusted their farming system, albeit at different levels. A probit analysis shows that awareness, perception, education, crop production, soil fertility and annual revenue are highly influential on farmers’ climate change impacts adaptation. This research highlights farmer awareness and perceptions as key factors in the climate change impacts adaptation debate. The findings reveal that effective adaptation to climate change impacts is highly dependent on the extent of community awareness and how farmers perceive the impacts of climate change. The study highlights that institutions targeting households’ livelihood improvement and making decisions concerning climate change adaptation need to focus on media outreach in local languages, improving locally adapted extension services, and developing water use efficiency measures such as improved irrigation for effective and long-term adaptation.",International Fund for Agricultural Development - IFAD,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-018-0173-4,Open access,CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/11220,,2018-05-23,"Environment, Development and Sustainability",1387-585X,Springer (part of Springer Nature) (Springer Open Choice Hybrid Journals),,,,adaptation; climate change; drylands; impact; perception; awareness,NE
A SWAT modeling approach to assess the impact of climate change on consumptive water use in Lower Chenab Canal area of Indus basin,"Awan, Usman; Liaqat, Umar Waqas; Choi, Minha; Ismail, Ali",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Hanyang University; Sungkyunkwan University,"Accurate assessment of spatio-temporal variations of consumptive water use (CWU) in large
irrigation schemes is crucial for several hydrological applications. This study is designed to evaluate
the impact of climate change on CWU in the Lower Chenab Canal (LCC) irrigation scheme of the
Indus basin irrigation system of Pakistan. A distributed hydrological model, the soil and water
assessment tool (SWAT), was spatially calibrated (2005–2009) and validated (2010–2012) for monthly
CWU. The estimated CWU using the SWAT model showed promising results (the coefficient of
determination (R2) ¼ 0.87 ± 0.06, Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) ¼ 0.83 ± 0.06)) when
compared with CWU determined by the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm (R2 ¼ 0.87 ± 0.06,
NSE ¼ 0.83 ± 0.06). Future evaluation, performed by considering the representative concentration
pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 climate change scenarios, showed that changes in temperature and
rainfall would significantly influence the CWU in the LCC scheme. Compared with the reference
period, annual water consumption in the basin would increase overall by 7% and 11% at the end of
2020 with monthly variations of –40% to 60% and –17% to 80% under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate
change scenarios, respectively. The water managers in the region have to consider this fluctuating

Analyzing climate trends and variability is essential to develop effective adaptation strategies, particularly for countries vulnerable to climate change. This study analyzed trends and variabilities of climate (rainfall, maximum temperature (Tmax), and minimum temperature (Tmin)) at local and regional scales in Ethiopia. The local analysis was carried out considering each meteorological station, while the regional analyses were based on agroecological zones (AEZs). This study used observations from 47 rainfall and 37 temperature stations obtained from the Ethiopian Meteorological Institute (EMI) for the period of 1986 to 2020. The Modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) trend test and Theil Sen’s slope estimator were used to analyze the trends and magnitudes of change, respectively, in rainfall as well as temperature. The coefficient of variation (CV) and standardized anomaly index (SAI) were also employed to evaluate rainfall and temperature variabilities. The local level analysis revealed that Bega (dry season), Kiremt (main rainy season), and annual rainfall showed increasing trend, albeit no significant, in most stations, but the rainfall in Belg (small rainy) season showed a non-significant decreasing trend. The regional levels analysis also indicated an increasing trend of Bega, Kiremt, and annual rainfall in most AEZs, while Belg rainfall showed a decreasing trend in the greater number of AEZs. The result of both local and regional levels of analysis discerned a spatially and temporally more homogeneous warming trend. Both Tmax and Tmin revealed an increasing trend in annual and seasonal scales at most meteorological stations. Likewise, an increase was recorded for mean Tmax and Tmin in entire/most AEZs. The observed trends and variabilities of rainfall and temperature have several implications for climate change adaptations. For example, the decrease in Belg rainfall in most AEZs would have a negative impact on areas that heavily depend on Belg season’s rainfall for crop production. Some climate adaptation options include identifying short maturing crop varieties, soil moisture conservation, and supplemental irrigation of crops using harvested water during the main rainy season.
Conversely, since the first three months of Bega season (October to December) are crop harvest season in most parts of Ethiopia, the increase in Bega rainfall would increase crop harvest loss, and hence, early planting date and identifying short maturing crops during the main rainy season are some climate adaptation strategies.
Because of the increase in temperature, water demand for irrigation during Bega season will increase due to increased evapotranspiration. On the other hand, the increase in Kiremt rainfall can be harvested and used for supplemental irrigation during Bega as well as the small rainy season, particularly for early planting. In view of these findings, it is imperative to develop and implement effective climate-smart agricultural strategies specific to each agro-ecological zone (AEZ) to adapt to rainfall and temperature changes and variabilities.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envc.2023.100794,Open access,CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/69096,2023-11-14,2023-11-14,Environmental Challenges,,Elsevier,13,,,climate change adaptation; ethiopia; climate variability; agro-ecological zones; climate trends,
"Smallholder Farmers’ Perceptions on Climate Change and the Use of Sustainable Agricultural Practices in the Chinyanja Triangle, Southern Africa","Makate, Clifton; Makate, Marshall; Mango, Nelson",International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; University at Albany; Tongji University,"In developing regions with high levels of poverty and a dependence on climate
sensitive agriculture, studies focusing on climate change adaptation, planning, and policy processes,
have gained relative importance over the years. This study assesses the impact of farmer perceptions
regarding climate change on the use of sustainable agricultural practices as an adaptation strategy in
the Chinyanja Triangle, Southern Africa. In this empirical approach, we adopt methods that account
for the plausibility that unmeasured characteristics exist, which are correlated with perceptions
and the adoption of Sustainable Agricultural Practices. We use a unique and representative dataset
collected in December 2012 and June 2013, from smallholder farmers in the Chinyanja Triangle.
The results indicate that farmer’s perceptions significantly influence the use of sustainable agricultural
practices. Specifically, we established that farmer perceptions considerably impact the use of grain
legume rotations, inorganic fertilizers, compost, and farmyard manure. Our results highlight the
need for a serious and perhaps equal consideration of farmer perceptions regarding climate change,
as important inputs to climate change adaptation policies targeted at enhancing climatic resilience
in smallholder farming communities. This is plausible as the adaptation and pliability of farmers
to the effects of climate change should be a social process involving the collective efforts from

management, this study demonstrated the importance of distinguishing awareness from perception in
climate change adaptation studies and for policy design. The study was conducted in South-western
Burkina Faso. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, 360 households were surveyed. Rainfall variation
and onset of the cropping season were used as climate change evidences to assess climate change
perception and awareness. Descriptive statistics and Z-test were run. Results showed that beyond
climate change perception, farmers largely took adaptive measures when they understand and can
explain causes of climate change. Therefore, climate change adaptation studies and policy

"Adaptive Policy Responses to Climate Change Scenarios in the Musi Catchment, India","Davidson, Brian; George, Biju Alummoottil; Malano, Hector; Hellegers, Petra","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Wageningen University & Research Centre - WUR; The University of Melbourne, Department of Infrastructure Engineering; The University of Melbourne, Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences - UNIMELB - FVAS","In India the stresses on water resource systems have increased, due in part to increased demand for scarce water supplies. Yet, what could be of greater concern is the potential long-run threats of climate change affecting supplies. Before thinking of a policy response to these long-run concerns, the impact of climate change on the reliability of water supply across a catchment needs to be gauged from both a physical and an economic perspective. Once these impacts are known, a more target approach to policy can be formulated. The aim in this research is to briefly present and comment on the results of an assessment of some these dynamic interacting forces across the Musi catchment in India. Of primary interest are the impacts of three different climate variants over the next 30 years have on the reliability of water supply (at the 70, 80 and 90% levels) across seven different agricultural zones in the Musi catchment in India. A hydro-economic modelling effort underlies these results (see Davidson et al forthcoming) which draws on a hydrologic analysis based on the Hadley climate model to model the surface and ground water in the catchment. This model then provides inputs into an allocation model (REALM), to assess the amount of water reliably supplied to different zones in the Musi catchment at different levels of reliability. These flows are ultimately valued to determine the economic consequences of different climate scenarios. In this study, the results are reported for four dryland regions (zones 1 to 4), an irrigation region (Musi Medium,) and two river diverters (the Musi Anicut and the Wastewater irrigation system). Unsurprisingly, from a physical perspective the region’s most greatly affected are those heavily dependent on dryland agriculture, especially near Hyderabad City. This region is where the high value products (such as vegetables) are produced. These results imply that some caution should be exercised in choosing policies that allow for the adaptation of climate change, especially in the dryland zones.",,en,,Limited access,CC-BY-NC-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/6336,,2016-11-30,,,,,,,agriculture; climate change; drylands; water; catchment,IN

Climate change enforces to look beyond the plant – the example of pollinators,"Christmann, Stefanie",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,"Within global crop production 1961–2012, the share of pollinator independent crops increased twofold, but fourfold of pollinator dependent crops. Balanced diets within the boundaries of our planet require even more pollinator dependent crops. Particularly, Low and Middle Income Countries in the drylands produce pollinator dependent crops. However, climate change and agriculture increasingly cause risks for pollinators. Common reward-based seeding of wildflower strips is too expensive for these countries.

Precise modification in the specific targeted location of a genome has profited over the unplanned insertional events which are generally accomplished employing unadventurous means of genetic modifications. The advent of new genome editing procedures viz; zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), homing endonucleases, transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), Base Editors (BEs), and Primer Editors (PEs) enable molecular scientists to modulate gene expressions or create novel genes with high precision and efficiency. However, all these techniques are exorbitant and tedious since their prerequisites are difficult processes that necessitate protein engineering. Contrary to first generation genome modifying methods, CRISPR/ Cas9 is simple to construct, and clones can hypothetically target several locations in the genome with different guide RNAs. Following the model of the application in crop with the help of the CRISPR/Cas9 module, various customized Cas9 cassettes have been cast off to advance mark discrimination and diminish random cuts.

Modeling climate change impact on chickpea production and adaptation options in the semi-arid North-Eastern Ethiopia,"Mohammed, Adem; Tana, Tamado; Singh, Piara; Tiruneh, Adamu Molla","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics - ICRISAT; Haramaya University, School of Natural Resources Management and Environmental Sciences - Haramaya -SoNRMES","The semi-arid north-eastern Ethiopia region is characterized by low and variable rainfall. Terminal drought stress is the major constraint for chickpea production in this region. Climate change has also become one of important up growing issue as a consequence of the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In the present study, we used CROPGRO-Chickpea model to evaluate climate change impact on chickpea production and adaptation options at two different locations. Based on the simulation result, chickpea grain yield is predicted to increase under the projected climate changes (temperature, rainfall and CO2) in 2030s and 2050s time periods for all climate scenarios. Accordingly, mean chickpea grain yield is predicted to increase at Sirinka by about 20% and 34% in 2030s and 2050s, respectively under all climate scenarios. On the other hand, the increase in mean chickpea grain yield at Chefa is predicted to be 12% and 22% across the respective time periods. Cultivars changes are predicted to significantly affect chickpea grain yield across the different time periods. Based on the result, short duration cultivar is found to increase grain yield at Sirinka by about 11%, 10% and 11% in the baseline, 2030s and 2050s, respectively, but decrease grain yield at Chefa by about 9%, 4% and 5%. On the other hand, long duration cultivar is predicted to decrease grain yield at Sirinka by about 6%, 9% and 11%, but increase grain yield at Chefa by about 1%, 2% and 4% across the respective time periods as compared to the standard (control) cultivar. The result also indicated that supplemental irrigation is found to increase grain yield of chickpea at Sirinka by about 48%, 46% and 46% in the baseline, 2030s and 2050s time periods, respectively whereas the increase in grain yield at Chefa is predicted to be 17%, 16% and 18% across the respective time periods.

To address the issue, crop growth and yield of 14 wheat varieties grown on 18 sites in key agro-ecological zones of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in response to CC were assessed. Three future periods affected by the two projections on CC (SRES A1B and A2) were considered and compared against historic (1961-1990) figures. The impact on wheat was simulated with the CropSyst model distinguishing three levels of agronomic management. Averaged across the two emission scenarios, three future periods and management scenarios, wheat yields increased by 12% in response to the projected CC on 14 of the 18 sites. However, wheat response to CC varied between sites, soils, varieties, agronomic management and futures, highlighting the need to consider all these factors in CC impact studies. The increase in temperature in response to CC was the most important factor that led to earlier and faster crop growth, and higher biomass accumulation and yield. The moderate projected increase in precipitation had only an insignificant positive effect on crop yields under rainfed conditions, because of the increasing evaporative demand of the crop under future higher temperatures. However, in combination with improved transpiration use efficiency in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, irrigation water requirements of wheat did not increase. Simulations show that in areas under rainfed spring wheat in the north and for some irrigated winter wheat areas in the south of Central Asia, CC will involve hotter temperatures during flowering and thus an increased risk of flower sterility and reduction in grain yield. Shallow groundwater and saline soils already nowadays influence crop production in many irrigated areas of Central Asia, and could offset productivity gains in response to more beneficial winter and spring temperatures under CC. Adaptive changes in sowing dates, cultivar traits and inputs, on the other hand, might lead to further yield increases. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Utilization of Marginal Water and Lands in the Zerafshan Rever Basin as Part of a Climate Change Adaptation Strategy,"Khujanazarov, Temur; Toderich, Kristina; Tanaka, Kenji","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; International Center for Biosaline Agriculture - ICBA; CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems - DS; Kyoto University, Disaster Prevention Research Institute - KU - DPRI","This paper considers how marginal mineralized waters and salt affected soils can contribute to land remediation and create additional nutrition values for livestock and agropastoral communities through cultivation of arid/semiarid salt loving plants (halophytes) under water scarcity conditions. The mobility of toxic pollutants is highly facilitated by both chemical properties of soils and the aridity of the climate. Plants under such environments face multiple stresses caused by high temperatures, water and soil salinity, heavy metals, high PH and long-term water-shortage. There are limited numbers of native species along Zeravshan River Basin able to establish themselves in these soils and produce palatable biomass. Being irrigated with low quality drainage and thermal artesian water, species of the genera Artemisia, Climacoptera, Alhagi, Glycyrrhiza and Kochia exhibited clear distribution patterns and their abundance ar1d yield of green biomass varied significantly along salinity and aridity climatic gradients. The limits of mineralization of the marginal water optimum for crops growth and green biomass accumulation were found to be varied in the range of 2000-8200 mg 1·1. The soil salinity at the root zone was about 45 dS m·1 and salinity level of the ground water was 8.0-16.5 dS m·1, inappropriate for the imitation of traditional agricultural crops. A monitoring system for controlling interaction of chemical content of non-conventional irrigation water and salt affected soils through plants above-ground biomass over several sites in downstream area of Zeravshan river flow was established. Alternative use of marginal water and lands play a significant role in further development of climate change adaptation  strategy leading to produce autumn-winter forage and improve the feeding system for livestock, thus diversifying animal products and incomes of local agropastoral communities by ensuring sustainable ecosystem function and resilience.",CGIAR System Organization - CGIAR,en,,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/11608,2014-01-06,2014-01-06,Journal of Arid Land Studies,0917-6985,The Japanese Association for Arid Land Studies,24,1,101-104,climate change; water quality; land remediation; marginal waters; zeravshan river,TJ; TM; UZ

Assessing the long-term impact of conservation agriculture on wheat-based systems in Tunisia using APSIM simulations under a climate change context,"Bahri, Haithem; Annabi, Mohamed; M'hamed, Hatem Cheikh; Frija, Aymen","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; National Agricultural Research Institute of Tunisia - INRAT; National Research Institute of Rural Engineering, Water and Forest - INRGREF; The Institution of Research and Higher Agricultural Education - IRESA","Several circulation models are forecasting climate changes in the Mediterranean region. Accordingly, it is expected that water scarcity in the region will be higher with drastic shifts of hydrological and erosive watershed responses. In Tunisia, wheat yields have been variable over the years and are lower than the potential yields. In response, the adoption of conservation agriculture (CA), introduced into Tunisia in 1999 to help adaptation to climate change, has resulted in a substantial reduction in agricultural productivity. CA areas increased from 52 ha in 1999 to 14,000 ha in 2015. Using a modelling approach, the present paper evaluates the potential of CA to adapt wheat-based-systems to climate change in Tunisia.
The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model was used to predict the effect of tillage (conventional tillage [CT] vs. zero-tillage [ZT] and soil residue retention [ZT-RR]) on wheat productivity and soil fertility. Two contrasting locations in Tunisia were studied; one semi-arid (Kef) and one sub-humid (Bizerte). Results showed that the sustainable production of durum wheat under climate change conditions in Tunisia is possible through the adoption of CA practices (ZT and ZT-RR) in both sub-humid and semi-arid areas. In fact, mulching (residue retention) is more effective than CT (under semi-arid and sub-humid conditions) in enhancing wheat yield (15%), water use efficiency (18% and 13%) and soil organic carbon accumulation (0.13 t ha−1 year−1 and 0.18 t ha−1 year−1). It is also more effective for soil resilience – preventing water erosion (1.7 t ha−1 year−1 and 4.6 t ha−1 year−1 of soil loss). The present study allowed identification of 260,000 ha as priority areas for CA adoption; this represent one-third of the total cereal area in Tunisia. Appropriate evaluation of the benefits of CA on sustainable agricultural intensification would provide more arguments for effectively supporting CA adoption in Tunisia.",International Fund for Agricultural Development - IFAD,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.307,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/10157,2019-11-01,2019-07-21,Science of the Total Environment,0048-9697,Elsevier (12 months),692,,1223-1233,climate change; zero tillage; soil organic carbon; water-use efficiency; wheat; wheat yield; apsim model; soil-water erosion,TN

Adapting to climate change by improving water productivity of soils in dry areas,"Qadir, Manzoor; Noble, Andrew; Chartres, C.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; International Water Management Institute - IWMI,"Considering extreme events of climate change and declining availability of appropriate quality water and/or highly productive soil resources for agriculture in dryland regions, the need to produce more food, forage and fibre will necessitate the effective utilization of marginal-quality water and soil resources. Recent research and practices have demonstrated that effective utilization of these natural resources in dry areas can improve agricultural productivity per unit area and per unit water applied. This paper focuses on the following three case studies as examples: (1) low productivity soils affected by high levels of magnesium in soil solution and on the cation exchange complex; (2) degraded sandy soils under rainfed conditions characterized by low water-holding capacity, organic matter and clay content and (3) abandoned irrigated soils with elevated levels of salts inhibiting growth of income generating crops. The results of these studies demonstrate that application of calcium-supplying phosphogypsum to high-magnesium soils, addition of clays to light textured degraded soils and phytoremediation of abandoned salt-affected soils significantly improved productivity of these soils. Furthermore, under most circumstances, these interventions were economically viable, revealing that the efficient use of marginal-quality water and soil resources has the potential to improve livelihoods amid growing populations in dry areas while reversing the natural resource degradation trend. However, considerably more investment and policy-level interventions are needed to tackle soil degradation/remediation issues across both irrigated and dryland agricultural environments if the major challenge of producing enough food, forage and fibre is to be met.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.1091,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/66927,,2013-02-24,Land Degradation and Development,1085-3278,John Wiley and Sons,24,1,12-21,climate change; water; soil resources; climate change impacts; sandy soils; salt-affected soils; water productivity.; food secuity,

We conducted focus groups and interviews with 289 individuals. We found that men and women are negatively affected by rangeland degradation and water scarcity, but women are additionally disadvantaged by their inability to own land and access credit and by drought mitigation and rangeland rehabilitation training that only target men. Women are involved in livestock grazing and rearing activities to a greater extent than is assumed in policy circles but in different ways than the men from the same households and communities. Understanding how women use rangelands is a necessary first step to ensuring that they benefit from rangeland management.

North African countries in western Mediterranean basin, including Tunisia, are expected to experience strong rainfall drop and temperature increase in the next few decades, interrogating the geographical distribution of many plant species in the context of future climate change. Here, ecologically based quantitative climatic envelope model was developed using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) to predict current and future distribution of Brassica tournefortii in Tunisia. The data inputs were composed of the species occurrence data and nineteen climatic layers varied over time in line with the predictions created from the global warming scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0) by 2050 and 2070. Using nine uncorrelated variables fitting very well our MaxEnt model, results revealed that the distribution of B. tournefortii was mainly influenced by precipitation-related variables, which contributed with 79.58% in the model, whereas a small contribution was attributed to temperature-related variables (18.20%). Moreover, a noticeable reduction in the current species’ range was recorded, compared with that observed during Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, the results suggested a small increase in the areas of very highly, highly, and moderately suitable habitats for the species (0.2, 0.28, and 2.41%, respectively) by 2070 under RCP 6.0. Importantly, we found that the habitat suitability of the species, when applying a climate envelope model, was optimal both along the coastal and the dry South-Western zones of the study area.

"Impact of Climate Change on Groundwater Fluctuation, Root Zone Salinity And Water Productivity of Sugarcane: A Case Study In Lower Chenab Canal System of Pakistan","Waqas, Muhammad; Shah, Syed Hamid; Awan, Usman; Arshad, Muhammad; Ahmad, Riaz","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; University of Agriculture, Faisalabad - UAF; University of Agriculture, Faculty of Agricultural Engineering and Technology - UAF- FoAE&T","Impact of climate in Pakistan is certain and its impact assessment is essential for the evaluation of irrigation system. In this study, impact of climate change on groundwater, root zone salinity and eventually on water productivity was assessed. Climate change data were assessed using the Hadley Climate model version 3 (HadCM3) and statistical downscaling was performed using statistical downscaling (SDSM) model. Further, bias correction was applied for the enhancement of SDSM results. Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model was used for the analysis of groundwater recharge, root zone salinity and water productivity under changing climate. Soil moisture and root zone salinity data were collected from the field for the performance of the calibration and validation. Automatic calibration was performed by integrating the SWAP with PEST. Water productivity analysis was performed for base period (1980-2010) and midcentury (2040-2069) under A2 and B2 climate change scenarios. Results shows that the groundwater depletion was less under the A2 and B2 scenario during the midcentury as compared to base period. Average annual groundwater depletion variation reveals 142 mm to 143 mm during base period and 121 mm to 124 mm under A2 and 117 mm to 120 mm under B2 scenario, respectively. While, average annual root zone salt accumulation was found 28 mgcm-3 to 21 mgcm-3 during base period and 26 mgcm-3 to 19 mgcm-3 under A2 and 27 mgcm-3 to 21 mgcm-3 under B2 scenario. Similarly, average annual water productivity was found 3.9 kgm-3 to 4 kgm-3 during base period, 3.4 kgm-3 to 3.6 kgm-3 under A2 and 3.2 kgm-3 to 3.4 kgm-3 under B2 scenario. Study reveals that the climate change has positive impact on the groundwater recharge and root zone salt accumulation. The results related with water productivity, salt mass accumulation and groundwater variations under changing climate suggest that sugarcane will be profitable business in future and environment will be sustainable.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/10736,,2019-04-01,Pakistan Journal of Agricultural Sciences,0552-9034,University of Agriculture Faisalabad,56,2,443-450,climate change; irrigation water; water productivity; anthropogenic factors; swap; sdsm; ibis,PK
Farming with alternative pollinators (FAP)—An overlooked win-win-strategy for climate change adaptation,"Christmann, Stefanie; Aw-Hassan, Aden A.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,"Climate change has been identified as an additional major risk for pollinators, but pollinators are key species for agriculture, interaction within interdependent ecosystems and climate change adaptation of agro-ecosystems. Though agro-ecologists proved enhancement of crop production by wild pollinators, applied agricultural research and development did not take up such results to increase farm income as an incentive for farmers to engage in protection of wild pollinators. We suggest farming with alternative pollinators (FAP) as an integrated agro-ecological-socio-economic approach and a self-sustaining win-win-strategy for farmers, agro-ecosystems and climate change adaptation.

It is based on the resilience concept and the calculation, with a modelling chain, of three indicators: land stock, labour stock, and income flux. Two system states, “base” and “climate change”, and a time horizon of 2010–2025, are developed and compared for representative farming systems. The study shows that 55% of the farming systems were identified as being resilient to climate change. They are diversified and mostly grow cereals, vegetables, and forage crops combined with livestock, increasing their capability to mitigate climate change by reorganizing crop activities. 35% of the farms identified as being non-resilient are dominated by orchards, or cereals and orchards. They showed an important drop in farm income (−45%), mainly due to their inability to adapt their cropping systems to water stress and soil salinity. Finally, only 10% were identified as being poorly resilient farming systems. Those farms have mainly intensified cereal cropping systems based on a strategy of purchasing land to increase the surface area of profitable activities (forage and livestock).

Decadal analysis of impact of future climate on wheat production in dry Mediterranean environment: A case of Jordan,"Dixit, Prakash; Telleria, Roberto; Al-Khatib, Amal; Allouzi, Siham",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; National Agricultural Research Center Jordan - NARC Jordan,"Different aspects of climate change, such as increased temperature, changed rainfall and higher atmospheric CO2 concentration, all have different effects on crop yields. Process-based crop models are the most widely used tools for estimating future crop yield responses to climate change. We applied APSIM crop simulation model in a dry Mediterranean climate with Jordan as sentinel site to assess impact of climate change on wheat production at decadal level considering two climate change scenarios of representative concentration pathways (RCP) viz., RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Impact of climatic variables alone was negative on grain yield but this adverse effect was negated when elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations were also considered in the simulations. Crop cycle of wheat was reduced by a fortnight for RCP4.5 scenario and by a month for RCP8.5 scenario at the approach of end of the century. On an average, a grain yield increase of 5 to 11% in near future i.e., 2010s–2030s decades, 12 to 16% in mid future i.e., 2040s–2060s decades and 9 to 16% in end of century period can be expected for moderate climate change scenario (RCP4.5) and 6 to 15% in near future, 13 to 19% in mid future and 7 to 20% increase in end of century period for a drastic climate change scenario (RCP8.5) based on different soils. Positive impact
of elevated CO2 is more pronounced in soils with lower water holding capacity with moderate increase in temperatures. Elevated CO2 had greater positive effect on transpiration use efficiency (TUE) than negative effect of elevated mean temperatures. The change in TUE was in near perfect direct relationship with elevated CO2 levels (R2 N 0.99) and every 100-ppm atmospheric CO2 increase resulted in TUE increase by 2 kg ha−1 mm−1.Thereby, in this environment yield gains are expected in future and farmers can benefit from growing wheat.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.07.270,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/13560,2018-01-01,2017-08-11,Science of the Total Environment,0048-9697,Elsevier,610-616,,219-233,wheat; climate change impact; decadal simulation; co2 effect; dry mediterranean environment,JO

Assessment of risk premium in farm technology adoption as a climate change adaptation strategy in the dryland systems of India,"Krishna Reddy, Kakumanu; Palanisami, Kuppannan; Ranganathan, CR; Shalander, Kumar; Haileslassie, Amare",International Water Management Institute - IWMI; Tamil Nadu Agricultural University - TNAU; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics - ICRISAT,"Purpose: Changing climate has increasingly become a challenge for smallholder farmers.
Identification of technical, institutional and policy interventions as coping and adaptation
strategies, and exploring risks of their adoption for smallholder farms, are the important areas
to consider. The present study carried out an in-depth analysis of adaptation strategies
followed and the associated risk premium in technology adoption.
Design/methodology/approach: The study was carried out in the dryland systems of three
Indian states - Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan, and was based on a survey of 1,019
households in 2013. The flexible moment-based approach was used for estimating the
stochastic production function, which allowed estimation of the relative risk premium that
farmers are willing to pay while adopting the technologies to avoid crop production risks.
Findings: In all three states, the risk premium (INR ha-1) was higher for farm mechanization
compared to supplemental irrigation, except in the case of Andhra Pradesh. The higher the
level of technology adoption, the higher the risk premium that households have to pay. This
can be estimated by the higher investment needed to build infrastructure for farm
mechanization and supplemental irrigation in the regions. The key determinants of
technology adoption in the context of smallholder farmers were climatic shocks, investment
in farm infrastructure, location of the farm, farm size, household health status, level of
education, married years, expected profit and livestock ownership.
Originality/value: Quantification of the risk premium in technology adoption, and
conducting associated awareness programs for farmers and decision makers are important to
strengthen evidence-based adoption decisions in the dryland systems of India.",,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJCCSM-10-2015-0149,Limited access,CC-BY-NC-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/4783,,2015-10-31,International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management,1756-8692,International Water Management Institute (IWMI),8,5,689-717,climate change; risk premium; flexible moment-based approach; dryland system; agricultural technology; technology adoption,IN

To quantify the impact of future climate change together with its uncertainty, two wheat crop models were executed in parallel, using two scaling methods, five Global Climate Models (GCMs) and two main Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for the 2050s. Simulated outputs varied among crop models, scaling methods, GCMs, and RCPs; however, they all projected a general decline in wheat yields by the 2050s. Despite the growth-stimulating effect of elevated CO2 concentrations, consistent yield declines were simulated across most of the main wheat growing regions of Mexico due to the projected increase in temperature. Exceptions occurred in some cooler areas, where temperature improved sub-optimal conditions, and in a few areas where rainfall increased, but these increases only provided negligible contributions to national production. Larger and more variable yield declines were projected for rainfed wheat due to current and projected spatial variability of temperature and rainfall patterns. Rainfed wheat, however, only contributes about 6% of Mexico’s wheat production. When aggregating the simulated climate change impacts, considering temperature increase, rainfall change, and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations for irrigated and rainfed wheat cropping systems, national wheat production for Mexico is projected to decline between 6.9% for RCP 4.5 and 7.9% for RCP 8.5. Model uncertainty (combined for crop and climate models) in simulated yield changes, and across two scaling methods, was smaller than temporal and spatial variability in both RCPs. Spatial variability tends to be the largest in both future scenarios. To maintain or increase future wheat production in Mexico, adaptation strategies, particularly to increasing temperatures affecting irrigated wheat, or expanding the cropping area, will be necessary.",International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center - CIMMYT,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.09.008,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/9762,,2018-09-17,Agricultural and Forest Meteorology,0168-1923,Elsevier Masson,263,,373-387,uncertainty; triticum; model ensamble; crop simulation model,MX
Impacts of climate change on farm income security in Central Asia: An integrated modeling approach,"Bobojonov, Ihtiyor; Aw-Hassan, Aden A.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies - IAMO,"Increased risk due to global warming has already become embedded in agricultural decision making in
Central Asia and uncertainties are projected to increase even further. Agro-ecology and economies of
Central Asia are heterogenous and very little is known about the impact of climate change at the subnational
levels. The bio-economic farm model (BEFM) is used for ex ante assessment of climate change
impacts at sub-national levels in Central Asia. The BEFM is calibrated to 10 farming systems in Central
Asia based on the household survey and crop growth experiment data. The production uncertainties and
the adaptation options of agricultural producers to changing environments are considered paramount in
the simulations.
Very large differences in climate change impacts across the studied farming systems are found. The
positive income gains in large-scale commercial farms in the northern regions of Kazakhstan and negative
impact in small-scale farms in arid zones of Tajikistan are likely to happen. Producers in Kyrgyzstan
may expect higher revenues but also higher income volatilities in the future. Agricultural producers in
Uzbekistan may benefit in the near future but may lose their income in the distant future. The negative
impacts could be further aggravated in arid zones of Central Asia if irrigation water availability decline

that market liberalization and improved commodity exchange between the countries have very good

We have therefore developed a regionally disaggregated supply model to simulate three types of scenarios concerning (i) decreasing quantities of irrigation water at the regional level; (ii) enhanced irrigation water use efficiency; and (iii) higher production prices. Observed crop production data for 21 crops and 24 districts of Tunisia have been used. Districts have been aggregated into five regions based on bioclimatic homogeneity. Results show that climate change will lead to the reduction of irrigated areas and an increased importance of rainfed agriculture. It will also have a negative impact on farm income and employment.

This study provides valuable insights into the conditions that can promote farmers' acceptance of regulated deficit irrigation and a new water pricing policy to address CC impacts on the semi-arid irrigated region which will allow for a sustainable irrigation regime and the conservation of water resources at regional scale. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze data collected from 100 farmers in the citrus regions of Beni Khalled and Menzel Bouzelfa, to identify determining factors for farmers' willingness to accept the proposed water management strategies. Empirical findings reveal that the significant explanatory variables are essentially linked to farmer satisfaction about the current irrigation management in relation to water supply reliability, rather than the social criteria and farmers' awareness of water scarcity. More efforts are needed to improve the transparency of water allocation systems to motivate the willingness of water users to adopt new technologies or policies.

A new index on agricultural land greenhouse gas emissions in Africa,"Epule Epule, Terence; Chehbouni, Abdelghani; Ongoma, Victor; Brouziyne, Youssef; Etongo, Dainel; L. Molua, Ernest",International Water Management Institute - IWMI; Mohammed VI Polytechnic University - UM6P; University of Buea; University of Seychelles - UniSey,"Africa emits the lowest amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the global GHG budget. However, the continent remains the most vulnerable continent to the effects of climate change. The agricultural sector in Africa is among the most vulnerable sectors to climate change. Also, as a dominant agricultural sector, African agriculture is increasingly contributing to climate change through GHG emissions. Research has so far focused on the effects of GHG emissions on the agricultural and other sectors with very little emphasis on monitoring and quantifying the spatial distribution of GHG emissions from agricultural land in Africa. This study develops a new index: African Agricultural Land Greenhouse Gas Index (AALGGI) that uses scores and specific scale ranges for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) to map the spatial variations in regional GHG emissions across Africa. The data for the three main GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N20) were downloaded from FAOSTAT. The data were analyzed through the newly developed African Agricultural Land Greenhouse Gas Index (AALGGI). This is an empirical index with scores ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher levels of emissions. The results show that Southern and North African regions have the lowest amounts of agricultural land GHG emissions, with AALGGIs of 3.5 and 4.5, respectively. East Africa records the highest levels of GHG emissions, with an AALGGI of 8 followed by West Africa with an AALGGI of 7.5. With the continental mean or baseline AALGGI being 5.8, East and Middle Africa are above the mean AALGGI. These results underscore the fact that though Africa, in general, is not a heavy emitter of GHGs, African agricultural lands are increasingly emitting more GHGs into the global GHG budget. The low AALGGIs in the more developed parts of Africa such as Southern and North Africa are explained by their domination in other GHG emitting sectors such as industrialization and energy. The high rates of emissions in East Africa and Middle Africa are mainly linked to intensive traditional farming practices/processes and deforestation. These findings underscore the need to further leverage climate change mitigation actions and policy in Africa and most importantly the co-benefits of mitigation and adaptations in the most vulnerable regions.",,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10196-4,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/68020,,2022-07-21,Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,0167-6369,Springer (part of Springer Nature) (Springer Open Choice Hybrid Journals),,,,agriculture; climate change; greenhouse gases; african agricultural land greenhouse gas index (aalggi),
Impact of Climate Changes on Water Resources Availability in the Orontes River Watershed: Case of Homs Governorate in Syria,"Yaghi, Tammam; Aldarir, Abdel Naser; Nangia, Vinay; Oweis, Theib; Arslan, Awadis",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; University of Aleppo; Arab Center for the Studies of Arid Zones and Dry Areas - ACSAD,"Homs governorate watershed is considered as the agricultural production hub and a strategic water reservoir of Syria. However, land fertility and the increase of population, as well as climatic changes, urged the farmers in this region to intensify the agricultural development. This has resulted in increasing pressure on available water resources of upper Orontes River Basin. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a prediction model that helps to estimate future availability of water resources. This paper analyzes how some strategies can help the government in achieving sustainable development. Consequently, their water security in the wake of climate changes till 2050. Four scenarios were studied depending on the actual situation (RF) with improving the irrigation efficiency: (1) Reuse of reclaimed agricultural water return, (2) Optimum exploitation of Zeita reservoir, (3) The reducing of the per capita share of drinking water and minimizing evaporation from the surface of Kattenieh Lake, and (4) Separation between Homs-Hama networks and raising their water conveyance efficiency by exchanging them with pressured pipe networks. The aforementioned scenarios were through three cases of climate changes (normal, dry and very dry years). The results are visualized as graphs, maps and tables, and showed that by application of the first three scenarios, the critical point (water deficiency) will disappear with obtaining surplus about 38% comparing with (RF), to achieve water needs of Homs-Hama networks (third priority) in case of normal years and high irrigation efficiencies in 2050. Also, water deficiency will decrease about 93% and 65% in case of dry and very dry years, respectively. While by application of the fourth scenario with closed circuits of industrial plants, we can avoid water deficiency and reduction of pollution rate in case of dry years in 2050, and decrease its rate to 77% comparing with (RF) in case of very dry years. This will necessitate water withdrawal (about 200 MCM) from other nearby basin such as Coast basin to minimize the gap between supply and demand.",United States Agency for International Development - USAID,en,,Open access,CC-BY-NC-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/6442,,2016-02-12,Jordan Journal of Agricultural Sciences,1815-8625,University of Jordan,12,2,499-519,watersheds; strategies; supply and demand; scenario; critical point (water deficiency); closed circuits,SY

Climate extremes studies conducted in Ethiopia are mainly limited to a specific location or watershed, making it difficult to have insights at the national level. The present study thus aims to examine the observed climate extreme events in Ethiopia at both station and agro-ecological zone (AEZ) levels. Daily rainfall and temperature data for 47 and 37 stations, respectively (1986 up to 2020), were obtained from the National Meteorology Agency (NMA). The Modified Mann–Kendall (MMK) trend test and the Theil–Sen slope estimator were employed to estimate the trends in rainfall and temperature extremes. This study examines trends of 13 temperature and 10 rainfall extreme indices using RClimDex in R software. The results revealed that most of the extreme rainfall indices showed a positive trend in the majority of the climate stations. For example, an increase in consecutive dry days (CDD), very heavy rainfall days (R20), number of heavy rainfall days (R10) and consecutive wet days (CWD) were exhibited in most climate stations. In relation to AEZs, the greater number of extreme rainfall indices illustrated an upward trend in cool and sub-humid, cool and humid, and cool and moist AEZs, a declining trend in hot arid AEZ, and equal proportions of increasing and decreasing trends in warm semi-arid AEZs. Concerning extreme temperature indices, the result indicated an increasing trend of warm temperature extreme indices and a downward trend of cold temperature extreme indices in most of the climate stations, indicating the overall warming and dryness trends in the country. With reference to AEZs, an overall warming was exhibited in all AEZs, except in the hot arid AEZ. The observed trends in the rainfall and temperature extremes will have tremendous direct and indirect impacts on agriculture, water resources, health, and other sectors in the country. Therefore, the findings suggest the need for identifying and developing climate change adaptation strategies to minimize the ill effects of these extreme climate events on the social, economic, and developmental sectors.",,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos14030483,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/68204,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,Atmosphere,2073-4433,MDPI,14,3,,climate change adaptation; ethiopia; agro-ecological zones; rainfall extremes; temperature extremes,ET
An improved deep learning procedure for statistical downscaling  of climate data,"Kheir, Ahmed M.S.; Elnashar, Abdelrazek; Mosaad, Alaa; Govind, Ajit","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Agricultural Research Center Egypt - ARC Egypt; Cairo University - CU Egypt; Agricultural Research Center, Soil, Water and Environment Research Institute - ARC - SWERI","Recent climate change (CC) scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 
(CMIP6) have just been released in coarse resolution. Deep learning (DL) based on statistical 
downscaling has recently been used, but more research is needed, particularly in arid regions, 
because little is known about their suitability for extrapolating future CC scenarios. Here we 
analyzed this issue by downscaling maximum, and minimum temperature over the Egyptian 
domain based on one General Circulation Model (GCM) as CanESM5 and two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) as SSP4.5 and SSP8.5 from CMIP6 using Convolutional Neural Network

CNNSD was able to reproduce the observed climate over historical and future periods at a finer 
resolution (0.1◦), reducing the biases exhibited by the original scenario. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first time CNN has been used to downscale CMIP6 scenarios, particularly in 
arid regions. The downscaled analysis showed that maximum and minimum temperatures are 
expected to rise by 4.8 ◦C and 4.0 ◦C, respectively, in the future (2015–2100), compared to the 
historical period, under the moderate scenario (SSP4.5). Meanwhile, under the Fossil-fueled 
Development scenario (SSP8.5), these values will rise by 6.3 ◦C and 4.2 ◦C, respectively as 
analyzed by the CNNSD. The developed approach could be used not only in Egypt but also in 
other developing countries, which are especially vulnerable to climate change and has a scarcity 
of related research. The established downscaled approach’s supply can be used to provide climate 
services, as a driver for impact studies and adaptation decisions, and as information for policy 
development.

Differential impacts of climate variability on yields of rainfed barley and legumes in semi-arid Mediterranean conditions,"Yau, Sui-Kwong; Ryan, John","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; American University of Beirut, Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences - AUB - FoAFS","Climate change has emerged as a major concern for crop production. This study used a field experiment to examine the differential yield responses of barley, lentil, common vetch, and bitter vetch to weather in the Mediterranean region. Crops were grown in a 10-year rotation trial in Lebanon. Precipitation and temperature were used as explanatory variables in simple linear correlation and standardized multiple-regression analyses. Grain yields were not correlated with annual precipitation. Barley grain yield was correlated positively with precipitation from March to May (r=0.70) and the rainfall distribution index (r=0.71), but negatively with mean May temperature (r=-0.62) and absolute minimum temperature in January (r=-0.91). Unlike barley, legume grain yield was not correlated with any rainfall parameters. Common vetch grain yield was negatively correlated with mean May temperature (r=-0.68). Grain yield of the two vetches were also correlated negatively with the absolute minimum temperature in January, but grain yield of lentil was not correlated with any weather variable. Standardized multiple-regression analyses showed that mean May temperature had the strongest influence on grain yield of barley, lentil, and common vetch, indicating that, under climate change, higher temperature may have a more deleterious effect on grain yield than lower rainfall. The negative correlation between common vetch and barley grain yields and temperature in May suggests that early sowing to induce earlier flowering and maturity to escape the hot summer may be an option to increase common vetch and barley grain yields.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2013.766322,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/13515,,2013-02-21,Archives of Agronomy and Soil Science,0365-0340,Routledge,59,12,1659-1674,climate change; barley; legume; effective-precipitation index; precipitation-distribution index; rainfed temperate crops; standardized multiple regression,

We applied a multivariate probit model for the simultaneous multiple adoption decisions, and ordered probit models for assessing the factors affecting the level of adoption. The adoption of the various CSA practices is interrelated, whereas several factors, including household characteristics, plot characteristics, market access and major climate risks are found to affect the probability and level of CSA adoption. Climate‐smart agriculture (CSA) adoption and its intensity also vary significantly between eastern Bihar, which is relatively poor and densely populated, and north‐western Haryana. Engaging multiple stakeholders such as farmers, agricultural institutions, agricultural service providers and concerned government departments at the local level is crucial for the large‐scale uptake of CSA.

We used fine resolution vegetation and environmental data (soil, elevation and slope) from two large-scale surveys (320 × 1000 m2 plots in two 10 km × 10 km blocks) in the Upper Mekong to quantify (1) the role of abiotic and biotic (species interactions) factors in community assembly processes and (2) the effect of biodiversity, environmental factors and forest succession on above-ground biomass (AGB).
We found strong correlation between soil fertility and community structure in the early successional seres, while species interactions played an increasingly important role in older seres, presumably due to species complementary.
We detected a significant relationship between AGB and phylogenetic diversity, elevation and soil fertility across successional gradients. Within successional stages, soil fertility was not significantly associated with AGB, while elevation was significantly associated with AGB only in forest <100 years old. Phylogenetic diversity was positively correlated with AGB in the young secondary forest (< 15 years old) but not significantly associated with AGB in older seres.
Synthesis. Our results support the hypothesis that abiotic filtering influences species assembly in the initial stages of forest succession, while biotic interactions dominate community assembly processes in older seres. We found that phylogenetic diversity, soil fertility and elevation gradients were strongly predictive of AGB in a secondary tropical montane forest in Southeast Asia. However, elevation may reflect other underlying abiotic gradients, such as water availability. Phylogenetic diversity was significantly associated with AGB only in youngest seres (<15 years old).

The objective of this research is to analyze the long term meteorological trends in the middle and lower parts of Indus basin of Pakistan. We used monthly data from 1971 to 2010 and applied non-parametric seasonal Kendal test for trend detection in combination with seasonal Kendall slope estimator to quantify the magnitude of trends. The meteorological parameters considered were mean maximum and mean minimum air temperature, and rainfall from 12 meteorological stations located in the study region. We examined the reliability and spatial integrity of data by mass-curve analysis and spatial correlation matrices, respectively. Analysis was performed for four seasons (spring—March to May, summer—June to August, fall—September to November and winter—December to February). The results show that max. temperature has an average increasing trend of magnitude + 0.16, + 0.03, 0.0 and + 0.04 °C/decade during all the four seasons, respectively. The average trend of min. temperature during the four seasons also increases with magnitude of + 0.29, + 0.12, + 0.36 and + 0.36 °C/decade, respectively. Persistence of the increasing trend is more pronounced in the min. temperature as compared to the max. temperature on annual basis.

Evolution of a barley composite cross-derived population: an insight gained by molecular markers,"Raggi, Lorenzo; Ceccarelli, Salvatore; Negri, Valeria",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; University of Perugia - UNIPG,"Many studies have highlighted the continuously increasing need for genetic diversity in the field; nonetheless, plant breeding is still predominantly generating uniform cultivars. Evolutionary plant breeding offers the possibility of reconciling agro-biodiversity, high yields and adaptation to climate change. However, the diversity that can be conserved in heterogeneous populations, its evolution and the potential of 'evolutionary breeding' in the actual scenario of climate change is still a matter of debate. In the present study, a total of 147 barley individuals, 56 from seven parental populations (PPs) and 91 from the composite cross-derived population (CCP) resulting from their inter-crossing were genotyped at 22 Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) loci with the objective of obtaining insights into how genetic diversity evolved in the field during 13 years of multiplication. A total of 92 different alleles were detected in the PP and 100 in the CCP. Results showed that the composite individuals are grouped into five major clusters differing for both the number of individuals and the relative level of genetic diversity. The mean values of the most common descriptors of genetic diversity were not significantly different between the parental and the composite populations. However, analysis of molecular variance showed some degree of differentiation between the two populations suggesting that evolution occurred during the years of multiplication and selection effects were detected for some loci. The SSR loci detected as putatively under selection in the present study have already been reported as co-localized with quantitative trait loci for adaptedness traits or tagging genes related to abiotic stress response. According to the current results, evolving crop populations, which have the capability of adapting to the conditions under which they are grown, can be useful in conserving genetic diversity and as sources of genes for breeding purposes in particular in the actual scenario of climate change.","European Union, European Commission - EU-EC",en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0021859614001269,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/12482,,2015-01-08,Journal of Agricultural Science,0021-8596,Cambridge University Press (CUP),154,1,23-39,barley; breeding; climate change; molecular markers,

This paper aims to understand the main drivers of change that induce adaptation in water management. The Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) framework that juxtaposed the within and across micro-, meso-, and macro-level drivers was applied to a case study of the Nile Delta to identify key drivers of change and farmers' adaptive responses. The framework helped in contextualizing key gender, temporal, and spatial dimensions of the drivers, and to identify their individual and interactive effects on farmers' adaptation decisions. We find that farmers' gender-differential water management choices are influenced not only by the individual changes in the three spheres of influence but also their interactions. The study highlights the benefits of using MLP to identify challenges that should often be tackled simultaneously to improve agricultural water delivery and use. We demonstrated that adaptation choices in water management are more sustainable when farmers' decisions are supported by enabling environments, including local regulations, norms, national institutional frameworks, and policies. They are also informed by and responsive to global trends such as climate change and markets.","Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit  - GIZ; CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems - WLE",en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2022.2082765,Open access,CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/68184,,2022-06-28,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,1473-5903,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,20,7,1397-1414,adaptation; climate change; gender; irrigation water management; multi-level perspective,EG
Revival of traditional best practices for rangeland restoration under climate change in the dry areas: A case study from Southern Tunisia,"Ouled Belgacem, Azaiez; Ben Salem, Farah; Gamoun, Mouldi; Chibani, Roukaya; Louhaichi, Mounir",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Arid Regions Institute - IRA,"The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the benefits of reintroducing traditional grazing systems practices for improving arid rangelands. Grazing is the most extensive land use in southern Tunisia, but the rangelands have suffered many decades of severe degradation due to profound socioeconomic changes and the emergence of an agro-pastoral society in place of the former pastoral one. Traditional grazing systems (gdel and herd mobility), which had historically allowed for grazing deferment and control of grazing livestock were abandoned. Yet grazing management strategies are important tools to sustain integrated livestock rangeland production systems in dry areas in the face of ongoing climate change and human pressure. 
Design/methodology/approach – This study assesses the revival of traditional best practices of rangeland resting in a representative community. Total plant cover, species composition, flora richness and range production were determined in six rangeland sites subjected respectively to one, two and three years of rest; one and two years of light grazing after rest; and free grazing (control). 
Findings – Results showed that dry rangelands keep their resilience to the negative effects of climate change once human pressure is controlled. A maximum of two years of rest is enough to sustainably manage the rangelands in southern Tunisia, as this protection showed considerable and positive effects on the parameters scored. 
Originality/value – The revival of the traditional best practices under new arrangements adapted to current biophysical and socioeconomic conditions would be an excellent tool to mitigate the negative effects of frequent droughts and reduce the animal feed costs that poor farmers face.",International Livestock Research Institute - ILRI,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJCCSM-02-2018-0019,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/10219,,2019-11-18,International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management,1756-8692,Emerald Publishing Limited,11,5,,production; tunisia; plant cover; arid rangelands; rest duration,TN

atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases (GHGs), namely carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), as a result of human activities after 1750
(preindustrial era). During 1750 the concentrations for these gases were 280 ppm, 715
ppb, and 270 ppb, respectively which increased to 379 ppm, 1774 ppb, and 319 ppb,
respectively in 2005. It showed an increase of 0.23, 0.96, and 0.12% annually. The same
has further increased to 385 ppm, 1797 ppb, and 322 ppb, respectively in 2008
representing 1.6, 1.2, and 0.9% increase, respectively from 2005 levels at an annual
increase of 0.53, 0.43, and 0.31%, annually. Increase in atmospheric CO2 promotes
growth and productivity of plants with C3 photosynthetic pathway but the increase in
temperature, on the other hand, can reduce crop duration, increase crop respiration
rates, affect the survival and distribution of pest populations, and may hasten nutrient
mineralization in soils, decrease fertilizer-use efficiency, and increase evapotranspiration.
The water resources which are already scarce may come under enhanced stress.
Thus, the impact of climate change is likely to have a significant influence on agriculture
and eventually on the food security and livelihoods of large sections of the urban
and rural populations globally. The developing countries, particularly in South Asia and
Latin America, with diverse agroclimatic regions, challenging geographies, growing
economies, diverse agricultural production systems, and farm typologies are more
vulnerable to the effect of climate change due to heavy dependence on agriculture for
livelihood. These regions also are demonstrating poor coping mechanisms to adapt to
these challenges, and as a result there is evidence of negative impacts on productivity
of wheat, rice, and other crops to varying extent depending on agroecologies.
Upscaling of modern technologies such as conservation and climate smart agriculture,
judicious utilization of available water for agriculture through microirrigation and
water saving technologies, developing multiple stress-tolerant crop cultivars and
biotypes through biotechnological tools, restoration of degraded soils and waters, use, and conservation of biodiversity must be promoted at regional and country level
to ensure durable food and nutritional security. Reliable early warning system of
environmental changes, their spatial and temporal magnitude, coupled with policies
to support the diffusion of this information, can help interpret these forecasts in terms
of their agronomic and economic implications for the benefit of farmers and to
provide agriculture-dependent industries and policymakers with more informed
options to support farmers. These countries need to formulate both short-term
and long-term policies for improvement, sustenance, and protection of natural
resources. There is an urgent need for capacity building through international collaboration
in order to develop databases and analysis systems for efficient weather
forecasting as well as preparing contingency plans for vulnerable areas. The objectives
of this paper are to summarize the available information on adaptation strategies and
the mitigation options for climate change to meet the food security in South Asia

Savannas cover c. 20%of the Earth’s land surface and changes in the structure and dynamics of savanna vegetation may stronglyinfluence local people’s living conditions, as well as the climate system and global biogeochemical cycles.In this study, we use a dynamic vegetation model, the aDGVM, to explore interactive effects of climateand land use on the vegetation structure and distribution of West African savannas under current andanticipated future environmental conditions. We parameterized the model for West African savannas andextended it by including sub-models to simulate fire management, grazing, and wood cutting. The modelprojects that under future climate without human land use impacts, large savanna areas would shifttoward more wood dominated vegetation due to CO2fertilization effects, increased water use efficiencyand decreased fire activity. However, land use activities could maintain desired vegetation states thatensure fluxes of important ecosystem services, even under anticipated future conditions.

The present studies were undertaken to understand the effects of elevated CO2 on enzymatic activity and secondary metabolites in chickpea in relation to expression of resistance to pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera. Fifteen-day-old chickpea plants [ICCL 86111—resistant and JG 11—commercial cultivar] grown in the greenhouse were transferred to open-top chambers (OTC) and kept under 350, 550 and 750 ppm of CO2. Twenty neonates of H. armigera were released on each plant at 7 days after shifting the pots to the OTCs. Un-infested plants were maintained as controls. After 7 days of infestation, the activities of defensive enzymes [peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL)] and amounts of total phenols and condensed tannins increased with an increase in CO2 concentration in chickpea.

The adoption of the germplasms will however depend on the effective demand of wheat growers. This study investigates the preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for frost and yellow rust resistance, grain yield, grain color, plant height, and length of maturity traits of wheat in Ethiopia. A choice experiment method was used to generate 8181 observations from a random sample of 303 smallholder farm households. We report mean WTP values, preference heterogeneity and attribute non-attendance patterns based on different formulations of the mixed logit model. The results revealed that farmers are willing to pay for yellow rust resistance, frost resistance, increase in grain yield, and white grain color (cf. brown). Farmers showed disinterest in increase in length of maturity and black grain color (cf. brown). Farmers have high WTP for yellow rust resistance and frost resistance traits, which is nearly 10 times the value they are willing to pay for increase in grain yield of 100 kg per hectare. Similarly, farmers are willing to pay for harvesting wheat yield a month earlier a price four times the value they attach to increase in grain yield of 100 kg per hectare. The weight farmers attach to climate related traits of wheat show the importance farmers implicitly give to the climatic factors they must consider in their wheat production.

However, no framework exists for assessing and comparing different CSA research investments. Several aspects make it challenging to prioritise CSA research, including its multi-dimensional nature (productivity, adaptation and mitigation), the uncertainty surrounding many climate impacts, and the scale and temporal dependencies that may affect the benefits and costs of CSA adoption. Here we propose a framework for prioritising agricultural research investments across scales and review different approaches to setting priorities among agricultural research projects.

Wheat production and breeding in Sub-Saharan Africa: Challenges and opportunities in the face of climate change,"Tadesse, Wuletaw; Bishaw, Zewdie; Gizaw Assefa, Solomon",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; African Development Bank - AfDB,"Purpose – This paper aims to review the current status of wheat production, farming systems, production constraints and wheat demand-supply chain analysis; the role of international and national breeding programs and their approaches in wheat genetic improvement including targeting mega environments, shuttle breeding, doubled haploids, marker-assisted selection and key location phenotyping; and future prospects and opportunities of wheat production in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). 

Design/methodology/approach – Relevant literature works have been used and cited accordingly. 

Findings – Though traditionally wheat was not the leading staple crop in SSA, it is becoming an important food crop because of rapid population growth associated with increased urbanization and change in food preference for easy and fast food such as bread, biscuits, pasta, noodles and porridge. In 2013, total wheat consumption in SSA reached 25 million tons with import accounting for 17.5 million tons at a price of USD 6 billion, while during the same period the region produces only 7.3 million tons on a total area of 2.9 million hectares. The low productivity (2t/ha) in the region is principally because of abiotic (drought and heat) and biotic (yellow rust, stem rust, septoria and fusarium) stresses which are increasing in intensity and frequency associated with climate change. Furthermore, increased cost of production, growing populations, increased rural-urban migration, low public and private investments, weak extension systems and policies, and low adoption rates of new technologies remain to be major challenges for wheat production in SSA. Wheat breeding in SSA is dominantly carried out by National Agricultural Research Systems, in partnership with the international research centers [International center for improvement of maize and wheat (CIMMYT) and International center for agricultural research in the dry areas (ICARDA),to develop high yielding and widely adapted wheat genotypes with increased water-use efﬁciency, heat tolerance and resistance to major  diseases and pests. Most of the cultivars grown in SSA are originated from the international research centers, CIMMYT and ICARDA.

Drought Early Warning in Agri-Food Systems,"van Ginkel, Maarten; Biradar, Chandrashekhar",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,"Droughts will increase in frequency, intensity, duration, and spread under climate change. Drought affects numerous sectors in society and the natural environment, including short-term reduced crop production, social conflict over water allocation, severe outmigration, and eventual famine. Early action can prevent escalation of impacts, requiring drought early warning systems (DEWSs) that give current assessments and sufficient notice for active risk management. While most droughts are relatively slow in onset, often resulting in late responses, flash droughts are becoming more frequent, and their sudden onset poses challenging demands on DEWSs for timely communication. We examine several DEWSs at global, regional, and national scales, with a special emphasis on agri-food systems. Many of these have been successful, such as some of the responses to 2015–2017 droughts in Africa and Latin America. Successful examples show that early involvement of stakeholders, from DEWS development to implementation, is crucial. In addition, regional and global cooperation can cross-fertilize with new ideas, reduce reaction time, and raise efficiency. Broadening partnerships also includes recruiting citizen science and including seemingly subjective indigenous knowledge that can improve monitoring, data collection, and uptake of response measures. More precise and more useful DEWSs in agri-food systems will prove even more cost-effective in averting the need for emergency responses, improving global food security.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli9090134,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/13615,,2021-08-26,Climate,2225-1154,MDPI,9,9,,climate change; drought; food security; mitigation; drought early warning systems,
Cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) utilization for rehabilitating rangelands in arid regions of Tunisia,"Ghouhis, Fethi; Louhaichi, Mounir; Nefzaoui, Ali",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Office of Livestock and Pasture Authority - OEP; Independent / Not associated,"Proceeding paper on Cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) utilization for rehabilitating rangelands in arid regions of Tunisia:
 Currently, rangelands contribute 10-25% of livestock feed requirements, compared to 65% in the 1960s, reflecting important rangeland degradation and loss. Direct factors responsible for the loss/degradation of rangelands include expansion of cultivated land, illicit wood collection, overgrazing contributing toward erosion, frequent droughts, inappropriate development of policies and regulations around resource utilization, and climate change. In light of this, a national strategy for rangeland rehabilitation was launched by the Tunisian Ministry of Agriculture in 1990, and included cultivating, among others, atriplex, acacia and spineless cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) shrubs on a large scale. This strategy was implemented by the Livestock and Rangeland Authority (OEP), focusing on private rangelands, with a contract established between OEP and farmers. The OEP provides the cactus pads and the equivalent of US$70 ha-1 as an incentive to cover costs related to planting. In addition, the OEP provides technical assistance to farmers. So far, the non-planted areas have produced 0.2-0.5 t dry matter (DM) ha-1 as feed, while herbaceous biomass has increased by 3000 kg DM ha-1. Feed biomass has also increased to 6-12 t DM ha-1, with other benefits including increased fruit production for self-consumption or sale, reduction of soil erosion, improvement of biodiversity, shelter for wildlife, and improved carbon sequestration. Because land cover, feed and water resources are low on Tunisian rangelands and other such dry areas, the cultivation of cactus presents an opportunity to restore degraded areas, while livestock production stands to benefit, as it is also an important feed resource during barren and dry periods.",International Livestock Research Institute - ILRI,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1247.13,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/10394,,2019-08-12,Acta Horticulturae,0567-7572,International Society for Horticultural Science (ISHS),1247,,95-102,biodiversity; climate change; drylands; cactus; agropastoral; rangeland rehabilitation,TN

Innovations in wheat breeding and agronomy have delivered enormous gains over the past few
decades, with the average global yield increasing from just over 1 tonne per hectare in the early 1960s
to around 3.5 tonnes in the past decade. These gains are threatened by climate change, the rapidly
rising financial and environmental costs of fertilizer, and pesticides, combined with declines in water

The FIGS (Focused Identification of Germplasm Strategy) Approach Identifies Traits Related to Drought Adaptation in Vicia faba Genetic Resources,"Khazaei, Hamid; Street, Kenneth; Bari, Abdallah; Mackay, Michael; Stoddard, Frederick L.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; University of Helsinki - UoH; University of Queensland - UQ,"Efficient methods to explore plant agro-biodiversity for climate change adaptive traits are urgently required. The focused
identification of germplasm strategy (FIGS) is one such approach. FIGS works on the premise that germplasm is likely to
reflect the selection pressures of the environment in which it developed. Environmental parameters describing plant
germplasm collection sites are used as selection criteria to improve the probability of uncovering useful variation. This study
was designed to test the effectiveness of FIGS to search a large faba bean (Vicia faba L.) collection for traits related to
drought adaptation. Two sets of faba bean accessions were created, one from moisture-limited environments, and the other
from wetter sites. The two sets were grown under well watered conditions and leaf morpho-physiological traits related to
plant water use were measured. Machine-learning algorithms split the accessions into two groups based on the evaluation
data and the groups created by this process were compared to the original climate-based FIGS sets. The sets defined by trait
data were in almost perfect agreement to the FIGS sets, demonstrating that ecotypic differentiation driven by moisture
availability has occurred within the faba bean genepool. Leaflet and canopy temperature as well as relative water content
contributed more than other traits to the discrimination between sets, indicating that their utility as drought-tolerance
selection criteria for faba bean germplasm. This study supports the assertion that FIGS could be an effective tool to enhance
the discovery of new genes for abiotic stress adaptation.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0063107,Open access,CC-BY-NC-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/7234,,2013-05-04,PLoS ONE,1932-6203,Public Library of Science,8,5,1-10,climate change; figs; abiotic stress; fig; drought adoptation,FI
Implementing the strategy for the conservation through use of underutilised crops in the Pacific,"Taylor, Mary; Paroda, Raj; Jaenicke, Hannah; Mathur, Prem N.",The Pacific Community - SPC; Asia Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions - APAARI; International Society for Horticultural Science - ISHS; Bioversity International - Bioversity,"The Pacific region, home to an estimated 9.5 million people, is geographically, ecologically, sociologically and economically diverse. The region also faces numerous social and physical challenges simply by nature of the size of the islands, and their geographical isolation. The increasing reliance on imported food products has significantly affected the health of Pacific communities. Climate change poses further challenges to food security, through its impact on food production, health, infrastructure, the ability of countries to import food, and the ability of households to purchase food. In 2009, members of the Pacific Plant Genetic Resources Network (PAPGREN) met to identify the constraints which specifically impact on the development of underutilised species as significant part of food and nutrition security strategy of the region. As a result, the regional strategy “Crops for the Future in the Pacific” that supports the conservation through use of specific underutilised species was put in place. The regional strategy contained the following six key elements: i) Generation and collection of knowledge/research; ii) Communication and dissemination; iii) Policy advocacy; iv) Market development; v) Partnerships; vi) Capacity building and institutional strengthening. At the same time, the network identified the following crops as the target species important in food and nutrition security, breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), bananas of the Fe’i group and/or Pacific plantain, Polynesian chestnut (Inocarpus fagifer), Pometia pinnata, giant swamp taro (Cyrtosperma merkusii), bele (Abelmoschus manihot), the lesser aroids Alocasia and Xanthosoma and, particularly for the atoll islands, Pandanus spp. Research and development activities were similarly prioritised to include increased regional exchange of information to determine gaps and identify areas of future research focus. Increasing capacity for plant breeding and the use of traditional knowledge for the conservation and utilisation of these important crops were also seen as key to effective utilisation of these crops.

Soil organic carbon stocks in semi-arid West African drylands: implications for climate change adaptation and mitigation,"Tondoh, Jerome; Ouedraogo, Issa; Bayala, Jules; Tamene, Lulseged; Sila, Andrew; Vagen, Tor-Gunnar; Kalinganire, Antoine","World Agroforestry Center - ICRAF; Centre National de Recherche Scientifique et Technologique, Institut de l'Environement et de Recherche Agricole - CNRST- INERA; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT","In the West African drylands, SOC sequestration is seen as one of the prominent strategies to both enhance the resilience of agro-ecosystems and mitigate global greenhouse effects. However, there is a dearth of baseline data that impede the design of site-appropriate recommended management practices (RMPs) to improve and sustain SOC accrual. In this study, the Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF), a nested hierarchical sampling design was used to assess SOC and its spatial variability across the semi-arid zones of Ghana (Lambussie), Burkina Faso (Bondigui) and Mali (Finkolo). Soil samples were collected from three sites of 100 km2 stratified into 16 clusters and 160 plots and thereafter soil parameters were then analyzed using MIR spectroscopy. Regardless of soil strata, SOC storage with 95 % confidence level in semi-arid landscapes potentially ranged between 112 200 ± 14 000 and 253 000 ± 34 000 Mg C corresponding to 411 400 ± 51 333 Mg CO2-eq and 927 666.7 ± 124 666.7 Mg CO2-eq in the entire study area. On the other hand, investigation on the potential of climate change mitigation through SOC revealed contrasted figures as accumulation rates in cultivated lands ranged from 0.04 to 0.18 MgC ha−1 yr−1 and are balanced by higher depletion rates of −0.004 to −0.73 Mg ha−1 yr−1. This indicates the potential of semi-arid soils to store carbon through improved land management practices.

Why Self-fertilizing Plants Still Exist in Wild Populations: Diversity Assurance through Stress-Induced Male Sterility May Promote Selective Outcrossing and Recombination,"van Ginkel, Maarten; Flipphi, Ronald",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center - CIMMYT; Independent / Not associated,"Climate change creates challenges for wild species, but plants have survived and adapted
to similar changes in their evolutionary past. Most plants were originally outcrossing, one theoretical
genetic reason being that self-fertilization does not create novel recombinants that allow adaptation.
Thus selfing seems an evolutionary “dead end”. Nevertheless, self-fertilizing plants make up 14%
of seed plant species. We offer a new interpretation of a response by self-fertilizing wild species to
extreme existential threats, which creates novel recombinant progeny. This proposed mechanism
goes beyond reproductive assurance, the usual explanation of selfing. Extreme stress, such as
excessive heat within a specific window, first makes plants male-sterile, while female organs remain
functional and can receive wind-borne pollen from any of the few nearby stress-tolerant individuals.
Thus stress-induced male sterility enables and/or enhances outcrossing in selfing plants. Although in
practice this proposed mechanism requires very special circumstances and operates only in certain
species with conducive floral traits, we posit that over evolutionary time even such rare events
can make a significant lasting impact on a species’ survival in changing conditions. This proposed
mechanism, which we call Diversity Assurance, allows a population subject to severe stress to
sample preferentially those genes that underpin tolerance to that specific stress. These genes are
then recombined in subsequent generations, along with the male-sterility-under-stress trait of the
female parent. This contributes in part to explain the effective evolution and hence persistence of
self-fertilizing species. Diversity Assurance, we propose, is an adaptive mechanism that has been
selected under extreme stress, underpinned by a simple loss-of-function of the male reproductive
system. It may be triggered not only by heat, but also by other stressors. This proposed mechanism
helps to explain why even highly self-fertilizing plant species remain able to respond to environmental
changes through triggered outcrossing.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10030349,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/11857,,2020-03-03,Agronomy,2073-4395,MDPI,10,3,,adaptation; climate change; cross-pollination; genetic diversity; self-fertilization,

This is especially true in the Khorezm, an irrigated agricultural region near the Aral Sea Basin (Uzbekistan) which represents eight million of irrigated land in Central Asia. Water scarcity requires research and introduction of alternative crops into a common winter wheat–cotton rotation. Mung bean (Vigna radiata) is considered as a drought-tolerant crop that could be implemented in Khorezm and other similar drought prone areas. The main objective of this study was modeling the triple rotation sequenced the winter wheat (WW), summer mung bean (MB) and cotton (C) as a single cropping system. Specific objectives were to (1) update the parameterization of the irrigated winter wheat and cotton modules in CropSyst to identify the key variables impacting the triple rotation (WW–MB–C) on overall crop yield; (2) to parameterize and validate the developed (CropSyst-based) model using controlled triple rotation data and (3) carry out scenario analyses to capture the influence of soil fertility levels and irrigation water shortage on crops growth, development and yields. The results revealed, for the first time, the impact of different soil-ecological factors such as high soil fertility (HSF) and low soil fertility (LSF) varying levels of irrigation water availability on crops in the triple crop rotation. Compared to LSF simulated yields of winter wheat and cotton under HSF were increased with 0.58 Mg ha−1 for WW grain and 0.21 Mg ha−1 for cotton while mung bean grain yields were not affected by different soil fertility levels.
Scenario analyses showed the possibility of reduced (by 20%) irrigation for triple crop without the effect on yield. However, compared to full irrigation scenario, reduction of irrigation for 40 and 60% could decrease the rotation crops yields up to 33% and 40%, respectively. The developed model could be useful to increase the understanding of the nexus of food, energy and water in Khorezm and comparable regions of Central Asia, and to inform decision-making about sustainable use of available water resources.",International Food Policy Research Institute - IFPRI,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42106-019-00083-3,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/10579,,2019-12-17,International Journal of Plant Production,1735-6814,Springer Verlag (Germany),,,,climate change; wheat; water scarcity; mungbean; cropsyst; cotton rotation,KZ; KG; TJ; TM; UZ

Impact of climate change and agricultural practices on irrigation water requirements under Nile delta conditions,"Swelam, Atef; El-Marsafawy, Samia","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Agricultural Research Center, Soil, Water and Environment Research Institute - ARC - SWERI","Agriculture in Egypt consumes about 80% of the available water resources. With an ever-increasing demand and a relatively fixed supply of fresh water, every drop of water should be treated as a drop of life. Consequently, effective on-farm irrigation management becomes a must. The present study aims to estimate amounts of irrigation water (IW) requirements for crops grown in the Nile Delta Region over three decades (1985-2015). In addition, the impact of weather variability on the irrigation water needs from year to year is assessed using the FAO CROPWAT 8.0 model. Results showed that the mean IW requirements for winter crops ranged between 3,812 m3ha-1 (kidney beans) and 5,610 m3 ha-1 (sugar beet). On the other hand, IW requirements for summer crops are much higher with mean values ranging between 5,483 m3 ha-1 (kidney beans) to 25,411 m3ha-1 (sugarcane). For orchards, the mean amount of IW requirement ranged between 11,728 m3ha-1 (grapes) to 24,059 m3.ha-1 (banana). Variability of IW requirements due to climate variability ranged between -14% and +27% for winter field crops, between -6% and +17% for winter vegetable crops, between -6% and +19% for summer field crops, between -6% and +20% for summer vegetable crops, and between -5% and +20% for orchards. Summer cultivation of the same vegetable crops results in an increase in water consumption ranging between 44 and 145%.

Understanding Changes in the Hydrometeorological Conditions towards Climate-Resilient Agricultural Interventions in Ethiopia,"Sahoo, Satiprasad; Govind, Ajit",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; International Institute of Geospatial Science & Technology - IIGST,"Climate resilient agriculture (CRA) is very important to achieve long-term improvement in productivity and farm incomes under climate uncertainty. The present study focuses on investigating the plausible changes in the hydrometeorological conditions using big-data analysis techniques in the study of Ethiopia. The original contribution of this work envisages the importance of the CRA system in water-scarce areas for sustainable agriculture planning and management under changing climatic conditions. In the present research, a TerraClimate model was the basis for weather (precipitation and temperature) and hydrological data (runoff, actual evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration, vapor pressure deficit and climate water deficit); these data were used to determine the spatial distribution of the standardized anomaly index (SAI) and the slope of the linear regression for long-term (1958–2020) trend analysis. Future climate trend analysis (2021–2100) has been performed through the CMIP6 (EC-Earth3) shared socio-economic pathway (SSP 2) 4.5 dataset. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) with CSR and JPL data were utilized for the generation of water storage heat maps from 2002 to 2021. The results show that the average annual rainfall data for over 62 years was found to be 778.42 mm and the standard deviation is 81.53 mm. The results also show that the western part of the study area has the highest temperature trend, which diminishes as one moves eastward; the minimum temperature trend has been found in the western part of the study area. It was found that the equivalent water thickness (EWT) range of both CSR and JPL products was −15 to 40 cm. These results can help local climate-resilient development planning and enhance coordination with other institutions to access and manage climate finance.","Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation; CGIAR Trust Fund",en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13020387,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/68781,2023-01-28,2023-01-28,Agronomy,0065-4663,MDPI,13,2,,climate change; food security; gis; climate resilient agriculture; hydrological conditions,ET
A participatory method to enhance the collective ability to adapt to rapid glacier loss: the case of mountain communities in Tajikistan,"Christmann, Stefanie; Aw-Hassan, Aden A.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,"The rapid loss of small glaciers worldwide might result in mountain villages changing from having plenty of water during the growing season, to facing a scarcity even in scenarios with adaptation. Climate-change effects might cause the need for significant changes in rural mountain economies that currently rely on irrigated agriculture, pastoralism and labor migration. Previous research mainly focuses on geophysical aspects and little is known about the local ability to understand climate-change indicators or local collective adaptive capacity. A 2010 participatory case study in the Zerafshan Range, Tajikistan, disclosed a local lack of awareness of climate change and its consequences. We present a social learning method based on scenarios and visualization. The process exposed a remarkable potential for comprehensive adaptation, including in water harvesting, choice of crops and livestock, environmental enhancement, skills and conflict management. We recommend the approach as a model to promote local collective adaptive capacity development. The case study revealed high risks of massive out-migration from mountain villages if adaptation starts too late: countries with a high proportion of mountain agriculture might see significant losses of agricultural area, a reduction in food production and an increase in conflicts in areas where immigration occurs.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-015-1468-1,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/8327,2015-11-30,2015-07-23,Climatic Change,0165-0009,Springer Verlag (Germany),133,2,267-282,adaptive capacity; labor migration; adaptation option; ecologic dynamic; bonding social capital,TJ
"Simulation analysis of factors affecting sorghum yield at selected sites in eastern and southern Africa, with emphasis on increasing temperatures","Turner, Neil; Rao, Karuturi","International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics - ICRISAT; The University of Western Australia, Institute of Agriculture - UWA - IOA","Global warming is widely predicted to decrease crop yields in tropical, sub-tropical and Mediterranean climatic regions as a result of a speeding up of phenological development and shortening of the time to maturity. We used a well-tested simulation model, APSIM-Sorghum, to evaluate the impact of temperatures +1 °C, +2 °C, +3 °C, +4 °C and +5 °C above current temperatures measured over the past ∼50 years at four sites in eastern and southern Africa, namely, Katumani and Makindu in Kenya, Chitala in Malawi and Beitbridge in Zimbabwe, on the yield, aboveground biomass, transpiration and soil evaporation of short-, medium- and long-duration sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] cultivars given, 0, 20, 40, and 80 kg nitrogen (N) ha−1. When fertilized with 80 kg N ha−1, warming temperatures decreased average yields at Chitala and Beitbridge and yields were unchanged at Makindu and Katumani, but with no added fertilizer average yields increased with increase in temperature at all sites except the hottest and driest site, Beitbridge, where the simulated yields decreased with increasing temperature. Simulation of the changes in soil organic carbon showed that the higher temperatures increased the rate of loss of soil organic carbon and increased nitrogen uptake at all except the driest and hottest site. A micro-dose (20 kg N ha−1) of added nitrogen increased the simulated yields by an average of 19% at Beitbridge, 36% at Makindu, 59% at Katumani and 72% at Chitala, considerably greater than any increase from increased temperatures. The use of longer-duration cultivars and lower or higher populations could not consistently be used to overcome any reductions in yield from warming temperatures. We conclude that low-input, small-holder farmers will not immediately have reduced sorghum yields as a consequence of global warming, but micro-dosing with nitrogen fertilizer will significantly increase yields even in the hottest and driest locations.",,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2013.06.002,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/5231,2013-10-01,2013-07-25,Agricultural Systems,0308-521X,Elsevier Masson,121,,53-62,crops; global warming; simulation modeling; apsim-sorghum; probability distributions; higher inputs; adaptation to climate change,KE; MW; ZW

worldwide, the impact of all factors affecting the gross
irrigation requirements (GIR) are not properly accounted

Groundwater contribution, leaching requirements, losses
in the irrigation system through feld application and conveyance and effective rainfall were included in GIR estimates. The GIR varied signifcantly among IRUs [average
of 851 mm (±143 mm)] with a maximum (1051 mm) in
IRU-12 and a minimum (629 mm) in IRUs-15, 16. Owing to varying groundwater levels in each IRU, the groundwater contribution played a key role in the estimation of the
GIR. The maximum groundwater contribution occurred in
IRUs dominated by cotton–fallow rotations as evidenced
by an average value of 159 mm but a maximum of 254 mm

A geo-informatics approach for estimating water resources management components and their interrelationships,"Liaqat, Umar Waqas; Awan, Usman; McCabe, Matthew Francis; Choi, Minha",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; King Abdullah University of science and technology - kaust; Hanyang University; Sungkyunkwan University,"A remote sensing based geo-informatics approach was developed to estimate water resources management (WRM) components across a large irrigation scheme in the Indus Basin of Pakistan. The approach provides a generalized framework
for estimating a range of key water management variables and provides a management tool for the sustainable operation
of similar schemes globally. A focus on the use of satellite data allowed for the quantification of relationships across
a range of spatial and temporal scales. Variables including actual and crop evapotranspiration, net and gross irrigation,
net and gross groundwater use, groundwater recharge, net groundwater recharge, were estimated and then their interrelationships explored across the Hakra Canal command area. Spatially distributed remotely sensed estimates of actual
evapotranspiration (ETa) rates were determined using the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model and evaluated
against ground-based evaporation calculated from the advection-aridity method. Analysis of ETa simulations across two
cropping season, referred to as Kharif and Rabi, yielded Pearson correlation (R) values of 0.69 and 0.84, Nash-Sutcliffe
criterion (NSE) of 0.28 and 0.63, percentage bias of −3.85%  and 10.6% and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 10.6 mm
and 12.21 mm for each season, respectively. For the period of study between 2008 and 2014, it was estimated that an
average of 0.63 mm day−1 water was supplied through canal irrigation against a crop water demand of 3.81 mm day−1.
Approximately 1.86 mm day−1 groundwater abstraction was estimated in the region, which contributed to fulfil the gap
between crop water demand and canal water supply. Importantly, the combined canal, groundwater and rainfall sources
of water only met 70% of the crop water requirements. As such, the difference between recharge and discharge showed
that groundwater depletion was around −115 mm year−1 during the six year study period. Analysis indicated that monthly
changes in ETa were strongly correlated (R = 0.94) with groundwater abstraction and rainfall, with the strength of this
relationship significantly (p < 0.01 and 0.05) impacted by cropping seasons and land use practices. Similarly, the net
groundwater recharge showed a good positive correlation (R) of 0.72 with rainfall during Kharif, and a correlation of 0.75
with canal irrigation during Rabi, at a significance level of p < 0.01. Overall, the results provide insight into the interrelationships between key WRM components and the variation of these through time, offering information to improve the

The first scenario presented 25% reduction in Nile flow, while the second scenario suggested adaptation measures to comply with flow reduction. The measures included leveling 100,000 feddans, serving 70,000 feddans with sprinkler irrigation, and lining 2,977 km of canals. The WB Model estimated WB components. The WSQI was a new index suitable for Egypt's conditions considering water quality. The water supply from High Aswan Dam (HAD) was predicted by the BlueM model for hydrological simulations of Nasser Lake. The study found that the current water shortage was fulfilled by drainage reuse and shallow groundwater, and the WQSI indicated a low water insecurity. The flow reduction increased the water shortage and reuse quantity. As a result, the WSQI indicated high water insecurity. The suggested measures improved agricultural water use efficiency from 51% to 63%, reduced water shortage, and improved the water insecurity level from high to medium. This study concluded that adaptation measures can improve the future water system and water security in the Qena Governorate.

Economic valuation of cactus pear production in semi-arid regions of Tunisia,"Louhaichi, Mounir; Hamdeni, Imtinene; Slim, Slim; Hassan, Sawsan; Harbeg, Lamia; Ghouhis, Fethi",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Office of Livestock and Pasture Authority - OEP; National Agronomic Institute of Tunisia - INAT; Ecole Supérieure d'Agriculture de Mateur - ESAM,"Arid and semi-arid lands are considered unsuitable for crop production because they require substantial amounts of water and additional nutrients. However, certain species can perform well and enhance the livelihoods of poor farmers. In the semi-arid regions of Tunisia, cactus pear (Opuntia ficus indica L. Mill.) is a potential subsistence fruit and forage plant. Sixty questionnaire surveys were conducted in Kairouan and Sidi Bouzid Provinces to assess the cost and benefits of cactus pear cultivation for feed and fruit production. Results showed that cactus pear production systems are characterized by low inputs; 85% of the farmers surveyed are using cactus pear for animal feed during the summer and fall compared to 26 and 37% in winter and spring. Fifty percent of the annual cactus pear cladode production (between 10 and 40 t ha‑1) is used for livestock feeding. Fruit productivity ranged between 1 to 5 t ha‑1 with an average of 2.5 t ha‑1. Both fruits and cladodes are harvested manually. The estimated net profitability of 1 ha of cactus pear is about 800 USD (32% fodder production and 62% fruit production). Farmers in semi-arid regions of Tunisia are practicing traditional production system techniques. However, with the new technologies available, a wide range of products based on fruits and cladodes can be obtained, which can increase cactus pear profitability.

Despite considerable effort by both national and international agricultural organizations to promote CSAPs in India, adoption of these practices is low. This study aims to examine the elements that affect the likelihood and intensity of adoption of multiple CSAPs in Bihar, India.

Design/methodology/approach
The probability and intensity of adoption of CSAPs are analyzed using multivariate and ordered probit models, respectively.

Findings
The results show significant correlations between multiple CSAPs, indicating that their adoptions are interrelated, providing opportunities to exploit the complementarities. The results confirm that both the probability and intensity of adoption of CSAPs are affected by numerous factors, such as demographic characteristics, farm plot features, access to market, socio-economics, climate risks, access to extension services and training. Farmers who perceive high temperature as the major climate risk factor are more likely to adopt crop diversification and minimum tillage. Farmers are less likely to adopt site-specific nutrient management if faced with short winters; however, they are more likely to adopt minimum tillage in this case. Training on agricultural issues is found to have a positive impact on the likelihood and the intensity of CSAPs adoption.

Practical implications
The major policy recommendations coming from of our results are to strengthen local institutions (public extension services, etc.) and to provide more training on CSAPs.

Originality/value

Modeling-based performance assessment of an indigenous macro-catchment water harvesting technique (Marab) in the Jordanian Badia,"Renzi, Niccolò; Villani, Lorenzo; Haddad, Mira; Strohmeier, Stefan; Hilali, Muhi El-Dine; Al Widyan, Jafar; Bresci, Elena; Castelli, Giulio",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; National Agricultural Research Center Jordan - NARC Jordan; Utrecht University - UU; University of Natural Resources and LIfe Science - BOKU; University of Florence - UniFi; University of Geneva; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Water resources management is fundamental for rural communities in drylands, where water harvesting technologies (WHT) can be used for intercepting surface runoff and storing water in soils. The so-called “Marab” WHT was initially developed by Middle Eastern agro-pastoralists that reside or commute in semi-arid and arid rangelands. The Marab WHT is a macro-catchment measure consisting of earth dams and stone spillways along the contours of a lowland depression or floodplain. Dependent on the local context (i.e., climate, soil, management, etc.), the established Marabs show highly variable effectiveness and little scientific evidence is supporting the scaling out of the technology. This study aims at filling the knowledge gap on the Marab performance in different environments by simulating its hydro-agrological effects for different soils and climatic conditions using the AquaCrop model. A case study performed for a Jordanian Marab over three seasons (2019–2022) confirms its huge improvement potential for barley production. Through Marab-based farming, barley production reached 8.37 t ha 1 on average, versus highly variable 0.34 t ha 1 without the WHT. The simulation-based assessment of soil textures identified that silty soils have the largest potential for producing up to 9.25 t ha 1 barley, compared to 6.60 t ha 1 produced in clay soils. Assessing different climate scenarios, a slight increase in daily average temperatures (+0.5 C) led to a considerable production decline of 4%–8%, while a significant reduction of precipitation ( 20%) decreased biomass production by a similar rate (4%–10%). This underlines the robustness of the “Marab” WHT to rainfall amount variation. However, simulations also highlight the sensitivity of timing and frequency of flood events: removing the last and the first flood event reduced biomass production by approximately 50% and 80%, respectively, while the barley fails to develop if both events were suppressed.","United States Department of Agriculture, US Forest Service - USDA-USFS",en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4838,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/69072,2023-11-01,2023-07-26,Land Degradation and Development,1085-3278,Wiley (24 months - No Online Open),34,17,5191-5206,climate change; drylands; rangelands; modelling; rainwater harvesting; aquacrop,JO

Past domestication processes resulted in a high degree of relatedness between modern varieties of crops, leading to a narrower genetic base of cultivated germplasm prone to pests and diseases. Crop wild relatives (CWRs) harbor genetic diversity tested by natural selection in a range of environments. To fully understand and exploit local adaptation in CWR, studies in geographical centers of origin combining ecology, physiology, and genetics are needed. With the advent of modern genomics and computation, combined with systematic phenotyping, it is feasible to revisit wild accessions and landraces and prioritize their use for breeding, providing sources of disease resistances; tolerances of drought, heat, frost, and salinity abiotic stresses; nutrient densities across major and minor elements; and food quality traits. Establishment of hybrid populations with CWRs gives breeders a considerable benefit of a prebreeding tool for identifying and harnessing wild alleles and provides extremely valuable long-term resources. There is a need of further collecting and both ex situ and in situ conservation of CWR diversity of these taxa in the face of habitat loss and degradation and climate change.

the three main tree species of the agroforestry parkland
system. Sorghum biomass and grain yield in different
influence zones (sub-canopy, outside edge of canopy,
open field) was affected by the amount of precipitation
but also by tree canopy density, the latter depending
itself on the ecological zone. The harvest index (grain
as part of total biomass) was highest under the tree
canopy and in the zone furthest from the tree, an effect
that according to the model reflects relative absence of
stress factors in the later part of the growing season.
While simulating the effects of different management
options under current and future climates still requires
further empirical corroboration and model improvement,
the options of tree canopy pruning to reduce
shading while maintaining tree root functions probably
is key to parkland adaptation to a changing

Moench) is an important staple food in semi-arid tropics which contribute to food security and poverty alleviation in Benin. However, its production is seriously facing enormous abiotic and biotic stresses including climate variability. To document its cultivar diversity, the impact of climate change on its production and diversity, the adaptation strategies developed by farmers and the performance of landraces, 22 villages were randomly selected and surveyed in the Department of Atakora in the northwest of Benin using participatory research appraisals (fields and granaries visit, individual and group survey using questionnaires, Four cells or distribution and extent analysis, etc.). Data were analysed through descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages, means, etc.) to generate summaries and tables at different (villages, individuals) levels and also through multivariate analysis (cluster analysis) and the results figures. In total 8 constraints affecting sorghum production were recorded among which striga proliferation, soil poverty and climate change effects (drought; excess of rain; delay, insufficient and irregular rainfall, etc.) were the most important. Subject to synonyms, 89 sorghum landraces were inventoried and their number varied from 4 to 17 (7 on average) per village. The Shannon–Weaver diversity index (H) estimated at 3.02 indicated high sorghum diversity in the study area. Many landraces were threatened. The relatively high rates (16.7–88.2 %; 40.9 % on average) of cultivars loss recorded per village are proofs of menace of genetic erosion and necessity of developing conservation strategies. Inadaptability of cultivars to climate variability (39.6 % of abandoned landraces) was among others the most important reason justifying the loss of diversity. Crop rotations, growing of early maturing and/or drought tolerant landraces, establishment of fields in lowlands are the most important strategies developed by farmers to mitigate impacts of climate change (low productivity, increase of damages from storage insects, early drying of plant leaves etc.) on the crop. Participatory evaluation of the existing landraces led to the identification of some high-performing ones that are resistant/tolerant to diverse abiotic and biotic stresses. Farmers’ cultivars preference criteria were identified and prioritized. Results of this study are useful to policy makers, agricultural extension services of the different districts, genetic resources specialists and breeders in order to improve sorghum production in Benin.",,en,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-015-0310-y,Limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/4602,2016-10-31,2015-09-01,Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution,1573-5109,Springer Verlag (Germany),63,7,1181-1201,agriculture; plant genetic resources; policies; seed systems,BJ

Rapid large-scale land use changes, poaching, climate change, rising population pressures, governance, policy, economic and socio-cultural transformations and competition with livestock all contribute to the declines in abundance. Here we analyze the population dynamics of 15 wildlife and four livestock species monitored using aerial surveys from 1977 to 2011 within Kajiado County of Kenya, with a rapidly expanding human population, settlements, cultivation and other developments. The abundance of the 14 most common wildlife species declined by 67% on average (2% / yr) between 1977 and 2011 in both Eastern (Amboseli Ecosystem) and Western Kajiado. The species that declined the most were buffalo, impala, wildebeest, waterbuck, oryx, hartebeest, Thomson’s gazelle and gerenuk in Eastern Kajiado (70% to 88%) and oryx, hartebeest, impala, buffalo, waterbuck, giraffe, eland and gerenuk in Western Kajiado (77% to 99%). Only elephant (115%) and ostrich (216%) numbers increased contemporaneously in Eastern and Western Kajiado, respectively. Cattle and donkey numbers also decreased on average by 78% in Eastern Kajiado and by 37% in Western Kajiado. Sheep and goats decreased the least in Eastern (28%) but increased in Western (96%) Kajiadio. Livestock dominated (70-80%) the total large herbivore biomass throughout the 1977-2011 monitoring period. The distribution of wildlife contracted dramatically during 1977-2011, most especially for wildebeest, giraffe and impala. Only zebra and ostrich distributions expanded in the county. However, livestock distribution expanded to densely cover most of the county. Our findings point to recurrent droughts, intensifying human population pressures, land use changes and other anthropogenic impacts, decades of ineffective or failed government policies, legislations, law enforcement, management institutions and strategies as the salient causes of the declines and range compressions. We recommend several urgent measures to rehabilitate the depleted wildlife populations and habitat richness, restore their ecological resilience to droughts and secure pastoral livelihoods.",,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1874213001407010009,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/5294,,2014-11-30,The Open Ecology Journal,2590-2776,Bentham Open,7,,1874-2130,climate change; governance; livestock; policies; pastoralism; wildlife; population dynamics; land use change; human wildlife-conflicts; rainfall influences,KE

Pre‐breeding using wild relatives can supply useful traits for durum wheat improvement to adapt to major abiotic and biotic stresses. Sixty‐seven lines issued from backcrosses of Cham5 and Haurani durum wheat varieties with accessions of Triticum aegilopoides, T. dicoccoides, T. urartu, and Aegilops speltoides were evaluated for drought and heat tolerance. The trials were conducted during two seasons (2016‐17 and 2017–18) at Tessaout‐Morocco under full irrigation (optimal conditions) and rainfed conditions (drought stressed) and at Wed Medani ‐Sudan under full irrigation combined with heat stress. The recurrent parents along with eight best cultivars and elite breeding lines were used as checks. Drought reduced the grain yield by 62%, grain yield and drought tolerance index were used to identify lines to be used by breeding programs to enhance drought and heat tolerance. The derivatives lines 142014 (Cham5*3/T. aegilopoides), 142074 (Cham5*3/T. dicoccoides) and 142015 along with the checks Icarachaz and Gidara 2 ranked among the best under heat stress. Under drought stress, the lines 141972 (Haurani*2/T. urartu) and 141973 (Cham5*2/T. dicoccoides) yielded 196% and 142% of their recurrent parents, respectively. High variation was found for agronomic and phenology traits, with heading time explaining 16% of grain yield under drought while thousand kernel weight accounted for 18% of the yield under heat.

Process-based dynamic growth models are important tools to estimate crop yields based on minimum inputs of climate, soil, crop management, and crop cultivar parameters. Using region-specific cultivar parameters is critical when applying crop models at a global scale because cultivars vary in response to climate conditions, soils, and crop management. In this study, parameters were developed for modern cultivars representing all 17 CIMMYT wheat Mega Environments (MEs) using field experimental data and genetic cultivar relationships for the CROPSIM-CERES model in DSSAT v 4.5 (Decision-Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer). Cultivar performance was tested with independent CIMMYT breeding trial field experiments across several locations. Then crop simulations were carried out at 0.5 x 0.5 degrees pixels for global wheat-growing areas, using cultivars representing MEs, soil information, region-specific crop management, and initial soil conditions. Aggregated simulated wheat yields and production were compared to reported country yields and production from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) statistics, resulting in a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.3 t/ha for yield and 2.2 M ticountry for country production. Some of the simulated errors are relatively large at country level because of uncertainties in pixel information for climate, soil, and crop management input and partly because of crop model uncertainties. In addition, FAO yield statistics have uncertainties because of incomplete farm reports or poor estimates. Nevertheless, this new cultivar-specific, partially-validated global baseline simulation enables new studies on issues of food security, agricultural technology, and breeding advancement impacts combined with climate change at a global scale.","International Food Policy Research Institute - IFPRI; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security - CCAFS; CGIAR Research Program on Wheat - WHEAT",en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2016.06.010,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/66948,2017-02-15,2016-08-04,Field Crops Research,0378-4290,Elsevier (12 months),202,,122-135,wheat; dssat; grass; global wheat production; geo-spatial crop modeling; cropsim-ceres,
A review of crop water productivity in the Mediterranean basin under a changing climate: Wheat and barley as test cases,"Un-Nisa, Zaib; Govind, Ajit; Marchetti, Marco; Lasserre, Bruno",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Tuscia University - UNITUS; University of Molise - UNIMOL,"The ever-increasing water demands in the agricultural sector of the Mediterranean basin region (MBR) under climate change warrants that crop water productivity (WP) is a relevant topic for discussion. Considering this need, this study aims to synthesize the body of knowledge on WP focusing on the MBR. The study is based on two test cases: (1) wheat, because it is a basic staple food in high dietary demand in the region and (2) barley, because it is a climate-resilient alternative that is extensively cultivated in severe water- and salinity-stress conditions. These staple crops are strategically important for regional food security in the MBR, which covers southern Europe, North Africa and western Asia. The study tries to investigate the plausible reasons for yield and WP gaps in the region. Our meta-analysis revealed that wheat and barley are very different in their spatial distributions, productions and stress resiliencies in the MBR. Under the large gamut of biophysical and socio-economic constraints that affect crop production, it is observed that the northern and southern parts of the MBR have large capacity differences (institutional, infrastructural and technical) in cereal production. It is noted that the role of soil-water management in improving WP is vital and plays a critical role in closing yield gaps across the MBR. Moreover, the scaling of stress-tolerant varieties along with a package of agronomic practices can enhance WP, and thereby we can make the region adaptive to climate change, especially in terms of water stress. The literature revealed that the MBR, especially the southern parts encompassing North Africa and western Asia, critically lacks comprehensive experimental/observational evidence on the dynamics of field water balance. This knowledge is key to enhancing WP assessments using modelling approaches. The paper concludes that the MBR does have water-saving potential; it simply needs planned adaptation measures to enhance WP at the local and regional scales with effective benchmark studies in future.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ird.2710,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/68235,2022-10-01,2022-04-17,Irrigation and Drainage,1531-0353,Wiley (12 months),71,S1,51-70,crop water productivity; wheat and barley,

Within rain fed winter wheat areas of Turkey and Iran, unusual weather patterns may prevent attaining maximum potential increases in winter wheat genetic gains. This is primarily related to the fact that the yield ranking of tested genotypes may change from one year to the next. Changing weather patterns may interfere with the decisions breeders make about the ideotype(s) they should aim for during selection. To inform breeding decisions, this study aimed to optimize major traits by modeling different combinations of environments (locations and years) and by defining a probabilistic range of trait variations [phenology and plant height (PH)] that maximized grain yields (GYs; one wheat line with optimal heading and height is suggested for use as a testing line to aid selection calibration decisions). Research revealed that optimal phenology was highly related to the temperature and to rainfall at which winter wheat genotypes were exposed around heading time (20 days before and after heading). Specifically, later winter wheat genotypes were exposed to higher temperatures both before and after heading, increased rainfall at the vegetative stage, and reduced rainfall during grain filling compared to early genotypes. These variations in exposure to weather conditions resulted in shorter grain filling duration and lower GYs in long-duration genotypes. This research tested if diversity within species may increase resilience to erratic weather patterns. For the study, calculated production of a selection of five high yielding genotypes (if grown in five plots) was tested against monoculture (if only a single genotype grown in the same area) and revealed that a set of diverse genotypes with different phenologies and PHs was not beneficial. New strategies of progeny selection are discussed: narrow range of variation for phenology in families may facilitate the discovery and selection of new drought-resistant and avoidant wheat lines targeting specific locations.",International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center - CIMMYT,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2018.00563,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/8234,,2018-05-01,Frontiers in Plant Science,1664-462X,Frontiers Media,9:563,,,heading; reproductive stage; vegetative stage; wheat; low rainfall; within species diversity,IR; TR

Particularly in industrialized countries pollinator diversity is in decline. The bulk of research is on entomological or plant‐pollinator network related topics, but the broad range of impacts of pollinator loss on coupled human and natural systems is not yet studied. As 87% of all flowering plants depend on pollinators, they are basic for all ecosystem services to some extent. Therefore, pollinator loss might cause simultaneous degradation of ecosystem services inducing counterproductive human responses and interlinked poverty spirals. The interaction of climate change, a main risk factor for pollinators, and unadvised human responses to pollinator decline are rarely studied. Tipping points of pollinator loss are not yet identified. Can counterproductive human responses to pollinator deficiency upscale pollinator decline toward a pollinator‐loss syndrome in the course of climate change?

Potential of grassland rehabilitation through high density-short duration grazing to sequester atmospheric carbon,"Chaplot, Vincent; Dlamini, Phesheya; Chivenge, Pauline",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement - IRD; University of KwaZulu-Natal - UKZN; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics - ICRISAT,"According to the World Resources Institute (2000), a relative increase of carbon (C) stocks in world soils by 0.4% per year would be
sufficient to compensate all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Several land management practices such as the suppression of
tillage in agroecosystems and livestock exclusion in grasslands had initially been thought to store more carbon into the soil, but recent
research puts this into question. In a context where finding effective C sequestration methods is urgent, the main objective of this study
was to assess the ability of an innovative grassland management practice based on high density and short duration (HDSD) grazing to
sequester atmospheric C into soils. The study was performed in a degraded communal rangeland in South Africa where soil organic C
(SOC) depletion ranged from 5 to 95% depending on the degradation level, which varied from nondegraded
(ND; with grass above
ground coverage, Cov of 100%), degraded (D1; 50 < Cov < 75%), D2 (25 < Cov < 50%) and HD (highly degraded: Cov < 5%). The
ability of HDSD (1200 cows ha− 1 for 3 days a year) to replenish SOC stocks was compared to four commonly used strategies: (1)
livestock exclosure (E); (2) livestock exclosure with topsoil tillage (ET); (3) livestock exclosure with NPK fertilization (2:3:3, 22 at 0.2 t
ha− 1) (EF); (4) annual burning (AB); all treatments being compared to traditional free grazing control. A total of 540 soil samples were
collected in the 0–0.05 m soil layer for all treatments and degradation intensities. After two years, topsoil SOC stocks were significantly
increased under EF and HDSD, by an average of 33.4 ± 0.5 and 12.4 ± 2.1 g C m2 y− 1, respectively. In contrast, AB reduced SOC
stocks by 3.6 ± 3.0 g C m2 y− 1, while the impact of E and ET was not significant at P < 0.05. HDSD replenished SOC stocks the
most at D1 and D2 (6.7 and 7.4% y− 1) and this was explained by grass recovery, i.e. a significant increase in soil surface coverage by
grass and grass production. HDSD is costeffective,
and thus has great potential to be widely adopted by smallholder farmers.",,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2016.02.010,Limited access,CC-BY-NC-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/5587,,2016-02-19,Geoderma,0016-7061,Elsevier,271,,10-17,climate change; degradation; rehabilitation; grazing; grassland; sequestration,ZA

The frequency of leaf rust and stripe rust occurrence was stable over time with marked increases in severity in 2001-2010 especially in Europe and Central and West Asia. Substantial global reductions in stem rust occurrence were recorded and attributed primarily to use of resistance genes although the recent emergence of race Ug99 makes wheat more vulnerable. The occurrence of powdery mildew remained globally stable over time. It was the most important foliar disease in Western and Southern Europe, where the frequency was very high for all time periods coupled with slight increases in severity during 2001-2010. The durable resistance of variety Bezostaya 1 to all four diseases was demonstrated in the study using comparisons of disease severities of Bezostaya 1 and the most susceptible entries. The Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 pleiotrophic set possessed by Bezostaya 1 is currently an important target for selection because it is now amenable to molecular selection. Increased use of genes like Lr34 combined with strategies to minimize cultivation of extremely susceptible varieties will contribute to long term maintenance of low and non-damaging disease levels. The durable disease resistance of Bezostaya 1, combined with its adaptability and good end-use quality, was a significant reason for its huge impact in agriculture over the last 50 years.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-011-9879-y,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/12061,2012-03-01,2011-11-06,European Journal of Plant Pathology,0929-1873,Springer,132,3,323-340,breeding; climate change; diseases; cereals; durable resistance,
Index-based insurance for climate risk management and rural development in Syria,"Bobojonov, Ihtiyor; Aw-Hassan, Aden A.; Sommer, Rolf",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies - IAMO,"Improving the adaptive capacity of rural producers to climate and weather risks may become an urgent issue in the early stages
of political stabilization in Syria. Therefore, this study analyses the agro-ecological, economic and social benefits of – and the
institutional challenges to – establishing index-based insurance markets to catalyse rural development in Syria. The paper
examines the potential of three index insurance schemes for minimizing risk: (1) a statistical index, (2) an index based on
agro-meteorological approach and (3) a remote sensing-based index. It also discusses how index-based insurance markets
contribute to rural development in scenarios of increasing climate risks. The study identifies that all three insurance
schemes have a very high potential to cope with increasing climate risk. Insurance schemes designed according to these
indexes performed very well in terms of covering revenue losses in most of the extreme drought years observed in the
country. Farmers purchasing an insurance contract may have better access to credit and find it easier to invest in
agricultural production and improve productivity. Because such alternative index-based insurance programmes are low
cost, they are more affordable for poor farmers and thus can potentially make an excellent contribution to economic
growth in rural areas.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2013.844676,Limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/7272,,2013-10-21,Climate and Development,1756-5529,"Taylor &amp; Francis: STM, Behavioural Science and Public Health Titles",6,,166-178,climate change; food security; ndvi; rainfall deficit; income stabilization,SY
Seasonal and climatic variation of weighted VPD for transpiration estimation,"Ghanem, Michel Edmond; Kehel, Zakaria; Marrou, Hélène; Sinclair, Thomas R.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; North Carolina State University - NC State; Montpellier SupAgro - SupAgro; Mohammed VI Polytechnic University - UM6P,"Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is one of the critical variables that drives evapotranspiration, and is of fundamental importance in crop physiology and modeling in the face of climate change. Unfortunately, direct records of atmospheric moisture are rarely available at short temporal scales, e.g. hourly, and country or regional scales. Most models use approximations to estimate daily transpiration-weighted VPD. Tanner and Sinclair (1983) suggested an approach to calculate weighted daily VPD as a fraction (0.75) of the difference between daily maximum and minimum vapor pressure based on estimates calculated from daily maximum and minimum temperatures, respectively. A test of the Tanner-Sinclair suggestion is reported by obtaining daily weighted VPD from hourly measurements of humidity and temperature. The objective of this study was to assess the fractional value to obtained daily weighted VPD estimations.

Cotton leaf curl virus disease a principle cause of decline in cotton productivity in Pakistan (a mini review),"Farooq, Jehanzeb; Riaz, Muhammad; Hussain, Tassawar; Farooq, Muhammad; Batool, Asia; Hussain, Tariq; Mahmood, Abid","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Independent / Not associated; Ayub Agriculture Research Institute, Cotton Research Institute, multan - AARI - CRI; Ayub Agriculture Research Institute, Pulses Research Institute - AARI-PRI","Among most serious threats of last two decades with reference to cotton crop in Pakistan is Cotton leaf Curl Virus. This disease inflicted huge losses not only to the cotton crop but also to the economy of Pakistan. It first appeared in 1967 on few plants in Multan and in 1992-93, caused a decline in production down to 9.05 million bales and during 1993-94, to 8.04 million bales well below the estimated targets in Pakistan. Various disease inducing procedures like grafting, delayed sowing, whitefly mediated disease transfer were exploited to screen out material against this notorious disease. Climate change and weather fluctuations have a profound influence on the spread of Cotton Leaf Curl Virus. Climate change is altering temperature and precipitation patterns, resulting in the shift of some insect/pest from small population to large population thus effecting crops yield. The abiotic factors like temperature and plant age influence cotton leaf curl virus disease epidemiology. Fiber quality traits like Ginning out turn, fiber length, fiber uniformity index, fiber fineness, fiber bundle strength, maturity ratio also deteriorated because of change in composition of major fiber components including cellulose, protein, wax and pectin. The ambiguity about inheritance is also prevailing whether it could be through dominant or recessive genes which may be monogenic or polygenic whereas Extrachrmosomal inheritance is also under discussion. The resistance break down depends upon the evolutionary potential of the pathogen and possibility of recombinations, by which new variants of viruses evolved. The resistance gained for Multan-CLCuV became susceptible to Burewala-CLCuV due to virus mutation and lack of durable resistance. Virus tolerant cultivars along with management practices like changing sowing dates, proper crop nutrition, better cultural practices, efficient vector control and buffer crops are the ways that can help to get better crop. Systemic poisoning of cotton seed by seed treatment may make the cotton crop safe in initial 40-50days after sowing. Biotechnology can also help in controlling this disease through transcriptional gene silencing.

Globally, the demand for food legumes is increasing as they complement cereals in protein requirements and possess a high percentage of digestible protein. Climate change has enhanced the frequency and intensity of drought stress, posing serious production constraints, especially in rainfed regions where most legumes are produced. Genetic improvement of legumes, like other crops, is mostly based on pedigree and performance-based selection over the past half century. To achieve faster genetic gains in legumes in rainfed conditions, this review proposes the integration of modern genomics approaches, high throughput phenomics, and simulation modelling in support of crop improvement that leads to improved varieties that perform with appropriate agronomy. Selection intensity, generation interval, and improved operational efficiencies in breeding are expected to further enhance the genetic gain in experimental plots. Improved seed access to farmers, combined with appropriate agronomic packages in farmers’ fields, will deliver higher genetic gains.

UAV-Based Multispectral Phenotyping for Disease Resistance to Accelerate Crop Improvement under Changing Climate Conditions,"Chivasa, Walter; Mutanga, Onisimo; Biradar, Chandrashekhar",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; University of KwaZulu-Natal - UKZN; Seed Co Group - Seed-CO,"Accelerating crop improvement for increased yield and better adaptation to changing climatic conditions is an issue of increasing urgency in order to satisfy the ever-increasing global food demand. However, the major bottleneck is the absence of high-throughput plant phenotyping methods for rapid and cost-effective data-driven variety selection and release in plant breeding. Traditional phenotyping methods that rely on trained experts are slow, costly, labor-intensive, subjective, and often require destructive sampling. We explore ways to improve the efficiency of crop phenotyping through the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral remotely sensed data in maize (Zea maysL.) varietal response to maize streak virus (MSV) disease. Twenty-five maize varieties grown in a trial with three replications were evaluated under artificial MSV inoculation. Ground scoring for MSV infection was carried out at mid-vegetative, flowering, and mid-grain filling on a scale of 1 (resistant) to 9 (susceptible). UAV-derived spectral data were acquired at these three different phenological stages in multispectral bands corresponding to Green (0.53-0.57 mu m), Red (0.64-0.68 mu m), Rededge (0.73-0.74 mu m), and Near-Infrared (0.77-0.81 mu m). The imagery captured was stitched together in Pix4Dmapper, which generates two types of multispectral orthomosaics: the NoAlpha and the transparent mosaics for each band. The NoAlpha imagery was used as input into QGIS to extract reflectance data. Six vegetation indices were derived for each variety: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), Rededge NDVI (NDVIrededge), Simple Ratio (SR), green Chlorophyll Index (CIgreen), and Rededge Chlorophyll Index (CIrededge). The Random Forest (RF) classifier was used to evaluate UAV-derived spectral and VIs with and without variable optimization. Correlations between the UAV-derived data and manual MSV scores were significant (R = 0.74-0.84). Varieties were classified into resistant, moderately resistant, and susceptible with overall classification accuracies of 77.3% (Kappa = 0.64) with optimized and 68.2% (Kappa = 0.51) without optimized variables, representing an improvement of similar to 13.3% due to variable optimization. The RF model selected GNDVI, CIgreen, CIrededge, and the Red band as the most important variables for classification. Mid-vegetative was the most ideal phenological stage for accurate varietal phenotyping and discrimination using UAV-derived multispectral data with RF under artificial MSV inoculation. The results provide a rapid UAV-based remote sensing solution that offers a step-change towards data availability at high spatial (submeter) and temporal (daily/weekly) resolution in varietal analysis for quick and robust high-throughput plant phenotyping, important for timely and unbiased data-driven variety selection and release in plant breeding programs, especially as climate change accelerates.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12152445,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/11852,,2020-07-30,Remote Sensing,2072-4292,MDPI (Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute),12,15,,climate change; remote sensing; maize; unmanned aerial vehicles; maize streak virus; high-throughput phenotyping; random forest; multispectral data,ZW

farmers are facing food insecurity challenge, especially in arid regions. The objective of this paper 
is to examine the resilience of households to food insecurity and to identify the determinants of 
this resilience in two study areas: Kairouan (in the center) and Zaghouan (in the northeast). The 
study relied on a cross-sectional database collected from 671 smallholder farmers. Multivariate 
techniques including factor analysis and linear regression models were used to measure resilience 
and identify its determinants. The results indicate that the levels of vulnerability and resilience are 
different depending on the specificity of the region. In Zaghouan, 63% of agricultural households 
are vulnerable, 5.5% are moderately vulnerable, 3% are resilient and 28% of households are very 
resilient. On the other hand, 51% of households surveyed are vulnerable in Kairouan, about 3% 
are moderately vulnerable, 4% are resilient and 42% of households are very resilient. The results 
reveal that the most important determinants of household resilience to food insecurity and climate 
change are “income and access to food”, “ownership of assets”, “access to basic services” followed 
by “adaptative capacity”, and “Social Safety Networks”. The “climate change” negatively affect 
household resilience and should be further investigated in the long term. Interventions must target 
strategies that address the different levels of resilience reflected by the resilience estimators.

stress conditions. Similarly, selection for pod set in the crop subjected to heat stress
during reproductive stage has helped in the development of heat‐tolerant varieties.

traits has been introgressed into several popular cultivars using marker‐assisted

At the same time, the growth of urban livestock markets both nationwide and in neighbouring countries is creating opportunities for producers. However, few studies have examined the role of markets in the adaptive strategies of livestock producers in West Africa, the changes in strategies for capturing market opportunities and the social interactions that lead to changes in market access and functioning. This paper addresses the question of how livestock producers and traders have transformed their producing and marketing strategies in response to climate variability and land access constraints. Our proposed conceptual framework on markets, vulnerability and adaptation considers that adaptive strategies include the social construction of markets through which market access is based on social networks and follows the norms and rules embedded in the complexity of these networks. This proactive strategy of stakeholders, through a socially constructed market access, allows traders to harness opportunities and livestock producers to adapt to climatic and land access constraints. We apply the framework in a case study in the region of Niono and Segou in the Niger Inner delta in Mali. Results show that livestock producers and traders have changed their livestock-raising and marketing strategies in response to the challenges faced by livestock producers and the emerging market opportunities. This study highlights the importance of considering the social construction of livestock market systems and marketing behaviours as adaptive strategies of livestock producers to multiple changes. Although livestock markets can support the adaptive strategies of several types of producers, their functioning as institutions has been understudied and scantily addressed in policy.","The French Agricultural Research Center for International Development - CIRAD; Center for International Forestry Research - CIFOR; CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry - FTA",en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geoj.12115,Open access,CC-BY-NC-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/68725,,2016-06-02,The Geographical Journal,0016-7398,Wiley (12 months),182,2,153-164,climate change; livestock; sahel; land tenure; adaptive strategies; social construction of markets,ML
On-farm water energy food carbon-footprint nexus index for quantitative assessment of integrated resources management for wheat farming in Egypt,"Omar, Mohie; Nangia, Vinay",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; National Water Research Center - NWRC,"To improve the farming efficiency, Egypt has been struggling to narrow the water, energy, and yield gaps owing to exacerbated water shortage. For quantitative diagnosis of farming performance, the paper presented an on-farm water, energy, food, and carbon-footprint (WEFC) nexus index made up of four equally pillars. The arithmetic average preserved the multi-centric approach and equal importance of the four pillars.
The index was applied to test and rank 2,042 wheat-based farmer fields in Egypt representing diverse inputs, agronomic and irrigation practices, soil types, and agroecological conditions. The water metric was the ratio of saved water, difference between maximum water consumption recorded in the country and actual water consumption, to the maximum water consumption. Likewise, the energy metric was obtained. The food metric was the ratio of actual yield to maximum yield in the country. The carbon footprint metric was the ratio of difference between maximum CO2 emission in the country and actual emission to the maximum emission. The index values showed a wide range from 18.69% to 87.33% with a high standard deviation emphasizing the diversity of farming practices, soil types, and agroecological conditions. The highest ten values were recorded in fields with sandy soils, relatively large area, drip irrigation,
recommended seeding and fertilization rates, well drainage, weeds removal, and tillage. The drip irrigation system in 51 out of 52 fields had above average value. The lowest ten values were in fields with clay soils and flood irrigation, where 18.7% of 1,780 fields exceeded the above average value. Raised beds
with furrow irrigation in 83.15% of 184 fields exceeded the above average value. Fertilization rates of nitrogen and phosphorus in 61% and 53% of fields respectively exceeded the recommended rates with no significant reflection on the food metric. The low index values in fields with flood irrigation were
attributed to high water losses causing high water consumption, energy consumption, and CO2 emission.
The index was a good indicative of input resources consumption and output production as it varied inversely with water and energy consumption and CO2 emission and proportionally with yield. Since the highwater consumption was the main entry point for low index values in fields with flood irrigation, changing
the irrigation to drip system or revisiting the irrigation scheduling and the estimated applied irrigation water amount were recommended.

The first objective is to measure the technical efficiency of mixed crop-livestock (CL) smallholder producers operating under conservation agriculture systems in Tunisian rainfed areas. The second objective is to explore complementarities, synergies, and economies of diversification across the different production system components of these crop-livestock producers using the cross-partial derivative framework of output variables in the distance function. A simple random sampling process was employed to select and survey 59 CL smallholders operating under conservation agriculture. The collected data were analyzed using a stochastic input distance function in which synergies were estimated based on the second cross-partial derivative concept of output variables in the distance function. Results show that technical inefficiencies are significant in integrated crop-livestock systems, and there is evidence that economic diversification provides a productivity buffer against climate change threats. As a sustainable intensification strategy, this integrated system also offers a potential advantage. The results further contribute to the debate on crop diversification vs. specialization. Although an enhanced system integration could be a financially and ecologically viable option for mixed crop-livestock systems, more pathways for profitable and viable diversification of cereal-based or orchard-based systems remain to be explored.",International Fund for Agricultural Development - IFAD; CGIAR Trust Fund,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2022.1022213,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/67886,2023-01-04,2023-01-04,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,2571-581X,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,6,,,"barley; conservation agriculture; forage; oats; sheep; goats; vetches; beef cattle; wheats; fenugreek; goal 2 zero hunger; goal 17 partnerships for the goals; goal 12 responsible production and consumption; goal 8 decent work and economic growth; goal 6 clean water and sanitation; triticosecale; wheat; vetch (vicia spp.); oat (avena sativa); triticale; cattle; technical efficiency; reduce inequality; integrated crop-livestock farming; climate adaptation and mitigation; environmental health and biodiversity; nutrition, health and food security; poverty reduction, livelihoods and jobs; gender equality, youth and social inclusion; economies of diversification; input distance function",TN

However, consequential soil water and vegetation dynamics have been rarely assessed, which constrains further  out- scaling of the rehabilitation practice to complex environments. In Jordan, an experiment was set up to study the linkages between local rainfall characteristics, soil moisture, and the development of out-planted shrub-seedlings. Soil moisture was recorded at approximately weekly time-interval during the rainy and dry season 2017/2018 using a manually operated soil water sensor.

Within the context of climate change and its adverse effect on agrobiodiversity, conservation of CWRs in Lebanon is essential to prevent the loss of potentially useful genetic diversity and to facilitate their use in crop breeding. To establish a comprehensive conservation plan for Lebanese CWR belonging to Poaceae and Fabaceae, in this study we prioritized 16 taxa based on their value for world security and local economy, gene pool (primary and secondary) and genome type (A, B and D for Triticum genera). Georeferenced occurrence data of populations belonging to the prioritized taxa list were retrieved from different sources and imported into QGIS to visualize by mapping their distribution in-situ and ex-situ on the Lebanese territory, highlighting sites with highest density per genus and sites characterised by the highest taxa richness. The analysis allowed to identify Lebanese areas that still need further surveying actions (mainly the south-west parts of the country) and showed that priority taxa had different distribution pattern independently from genus. Bekaa and Baalbak governorates were evaluated to include sites represented with highest taxa richness, which makes them preliminary contenders to be included within in-situ conservation actions.

For any crop improvement program, the selection of suitable gene pools among the germplasms is first needed. Drought and salinity traits are the most difficult ones to monitor for being polygenic. Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is the most commonly grown cereal grain. To predict new EST-SSR markers, 6717 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) expressed in drought and salinity stress conditions were collected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) then clustered and assembled. Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have been researched from all unigenes, and then characterization and functional annotation (GO, KEGG, enzymes, TFs, and conserved motifs) for SSR-containing unigenes have been achieved. Fifty primer pairs were selected and synthesized. A polymorphism comparison between the in-silico and real PCR results was conducted. High drought and salinity-tolerant genotypes were grouped in cluster B. Interaction networks between the predicted genes were explored. Out of the polymorphic primer pairs, two primers were identified as unique primers, which may be more related to drought and salinity tolerance and could be further used in quantitative trait locus (QTLs) mapping and marker-assisted selection (MAS).

Characterising the variability in root architectural traits in a core collection of chickpea germplasm will provide the basis for breeding new germplasm with suitable root traits for the efficient acquisition of soil resources and adaptation to drought and other abiotic stresses. This study used a semi-hydroponic phenotyping system for assessing root trait variability across 270 chickpea genotypes. The genotypes exhibited large variation in rooting patterns and branching manner. Thirty root-related traits were characterised, 17 of which had coefficients of variation ≥0.3 among genotypes and were selected for further examination. The Pearson correlation matrix showed a strong correlation among most of the selected traits (P≤0.05). Principal component analysis revealed three principal components with eigenvalues >1 capturing 81.5% of the total variation. An agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis, based on root trait variation, identified three genotype homogeneous groups (rescaled distance of 15) and 16 sub-groups (rescaled distance of 5). The chickpea genotypes characterised in this study with vastly different root properties could be used for further studies in glasshouses and field trials, and for molecular marker studies, gene mapping, and modelling simulations, ultimately aimed at breeding germplasm with root traits for improved adaptation to drought and other specific environments.",Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development - AFESD,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erw368,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/8000,2017-04-01,2016-10-06,Journal of Experimental Botany,0022-0957,Oxford University Press (OUP): Policy B - Oxford Open Option A,68,8,1987-1999,adaptation; cicer arietinum; chickpeas; root system architecture; chickpea; crop phenotyping; root trait variability,IN; NP

But, the question remains ‘to what extent can breeding gains be achieved under a changing climate, at a pace sufficient to usefully contribute to climate adaptation, mitigation and food security?’. Here, we address this question by critically reviewing how model‐based approaches can be used to assist breeding activities, with particular focus on all CGIAR (formerly the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research but now known simply as CGIAR) breeding programs. Crop modeling can underpin breeding efforts in many different ways, including assessing genotypic adaptability and stability, characterizing and identifying target breeding environments, identifying tradeoffs among traits for such environments, and making predictions of the likely breeding value of the genotypes. Crop modeling science within the CGIAR has contributed to all of these. However, much progress remains to be done if modeling is to effectively contribute to more targeted and impactful breeding programs under changing climates. In a period in which CGIAR breeding programs are undergoing a major modernization process, crop modelers will need to be part of crop improvement teams, with a common understanding of breeding pipelines and model capabilities and limitations, and common data standards and protocols, to ensure they follow and deliver according to clearly defined breeding products.

Furthermore, climate change due to global warming has increased their vulnerability to emerging new insect pests and abiotic stresses that can become even more serious in the coming years. The changing climate scenario has made it more challenging to breed and develop climate-resilient smart pulses. Although pulses are climate smart, as they simultaneously adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change, their narrow genetic diversity has always been a major constraint to their improvement for adaptability. However, existing genetic diversity still provides opportunities to exploit novel attributes for developing climate-resilient cultivars. The mining and exploitation of adaptive traits imparting tolerance/resistance to climate-smart pulses can be accelerated further by using cutting-edge approaches of biotechnology such as transgenics, genome editing, and epigenetics.

These temperature increases can result in heat stress- a severe threat to crop production in most countries. Legumes are wellknown for their impact on agricultural sustainability as well as their nutritional and health benefits. Heat stress imposes challenges for legume crops and has deleterious effects on the morphology, physiology, and reproductive growth of plants. High-temperature stress at the time of the reproductive stage is becoming a severe limitation for production of grain legumes as their cultivation expands to warmer environments and temperature variability increases due to climate change. The reproductive period is vital in the life cycle of all plants and is susceptible to high-temperature stress as various metabolic processes are adversely impacted during this phase, which reduces crop yield. Food legumes exposed to high-temperature stress during reproduction show flower abortion, pollen and ovule infertility, impaired fertilization, and reduced seed filling, leading to smaller seeds and poor yields. Through various breeding techniques, heat tolerance in major legumes can be enhanced to improve performance in the field. Omics approaches unravel different mechanisms underlying thermotolerance, which is imperative to understand the processes of molecular responses toward high-temperature stress.",Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development - AFESD,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2017.01658,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/8009,,2017-10-04,Frontiers in Plant Science,1664-462X,Frontiers Media,8: 1658,,,faba bean; lentil; chickpea; cowpea; legume; food legumes; high temperature stress; functional mechanisms; reproductive function; ‘omics’ approach,IN; KE; MM
Population structure analysis and determination of neurotoxin content in a set of grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) accessions of Bangladesh origin,"Gupta, Prinyanka; Udupa, Sripada M.; Sen Gupta, Debjyoti; Kumar, Jitendra; Agrawal, Shiv Kumar","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Indian Institute of Pulses Research - ICAR-IIPR; North Dakota State University - NDSU","Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is a crop that is considered one of the more resilient to climate change. With protein-rich seeds and leaves, it has strong potential as human food as well as animal feed and fodder. However, genetic improvement in this crop remains stagnant owing to the poor characterization of its genetic resources. In this study, we characterized 118 accessions of grass pea with 18 EST-SSR markers. A total of 118 accessions, 101 of L. sativus (100 cultivated accessions from Bangladesh and one wild accession) and 17 wild accessions of other Lathyrus species, were used. A total of 67 alleles were detected, with an average of 3.72 alleles per locus and average polymorphism information content of 0.52. A dissimilarity matrix was formed and hierarchical cluster analysis performed using the UPGMA method grouped genotypes into four main clusters. Cluster analysis based on the genetic dissimilarity revealed a clear grouping of the 100 cultivated and 18 wild accessions into four main groups. Group I consisted of 20 accessions with high β-N-oxalyl-l-α,β-diaminopropionic acid (β-ODAP) concentration. Of these 20 accessions, 17 were wild accessions. Only one wild accession (L. cicera) was clustered in group II, which contained 35 accessions. Most of the group II accessions contained low β-ODAP. Group III was represented by 34 accessions, many of them with high β-ODAP. Group IV consisted of 29 accessions, a few of which had very high β-ODAP concentrations. Analysis of molecular variance of the microsatellite data showed significantly higher values of molecular variance between (83%) than within (17%) populations.

Environment suitability mapping of livestock: A case study of Ethiopian indigenous sheep and goats,"Atassi, Layal; Haile, Aynalem; Solomon, Dawit; Demissie, T.; Rischkowsky, Barbara; Biradar, Chandrashekhar; Mwacharo, Joram","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; International Livestock Research Institute - ILRI; University of Edinburgh, College of Medicine & Veterinary Medicine, The Roslin Institute - ED - CoM&VM - ROSLIN; CIFOR-ICRAF Asia Continental Program","Demand for livestock products is increasing as climate volatility threatens animal productivity and welfare. Therefore, novel technologies and approaches to meet these challenges are required. Geo-informatics and geo-visualization can address a critical question in this endeavor -where can improved indigenous, newly developed and composite breeds be introduced while retaining optimal productivity and resilience to climatic and environmental volatility? Here, a case study of four and two Ethiopian indigenous breeds of sheep (Atsbi, Doyogena, Horro, Menz) and goats (Abergelle, Yabello), and geo-informatics based spatial analytics generating, for each breed, a suitability index map is presented. The analysis reveals overlapping and breed-specific enviro-geographic and ecological suitability niches. More than 51% of Ethiopia is unsuitable for the optimal performance of the six breeds. The proportions of unsuitable land are 64.84% (Menz), 53.44% (Horro), 76.98% (Doyogena), 83.53% (Atsbi), 82.37% (Abergelle) and 63.89% (Yabello). The suitable production range for the four sheep breeds show a slight overlap, but that of the two goat breeds did not. The goats are best suited to the drylands, but the niche for Abergelle is in the north, and that of Yabello is in the south of Ethiopia. The heatmaps suggest that the mean annual temperature and precipitation have the largest contribution in the classification of geographic areas into suitability classes. Our results provide insights for targeting location specific species- and breed-interventions, and with climate change trajectories and natural resource base abundance, will be a major criterion for building resilient livestock production systems.

Among these , 16 genotypes either had ‘Precoz’ gene, an Argentine line in their pedigree or genes from introduced lines from ICARDA. Sixty five SSR markers and eight phenotypic traits were used to analyse the level of genetic diversity in these genotypes. Forty three SSR markers (66 %) were polymorphic and generated a total of 177 alleles with an average of 4.1 alleles per SSR marker. Alleles per marker ranged from 2 to 6. The polymorphic information content ranged 0.33 to 0.80 with an average of 0.57, suggesting that SSR markers are highly polymorphic among the studied genotypes. Genetic dissimilarity based a dendrogram grouped these accessions into two main clusters (cluster I and cluster II) and it ranged 33 % to 71 %, suggesting high level of genetic diversity among the genotypes. First three components of PCA based morphological traits explained higher variance (95.6 %) compared to PCA components based on SSR markers (42.7 %) of total genetic variance. Thus, more diversity was observed for morphological traits and genotypes in each cluster and sub-cluster showed a range of variability for seed size, earliness, pods/plant and plant height. Molecular and phenotypic diversity analysis thus suggested that use of germplasm of exotic lines have diversified the genetic base of lentil germplasm in India.

Role of Sustainable Wheat Production to Ensure Food Security in the CWANA region,"Tadesse, Wuletaw; Halila, Habib; Jamal, Majd; El-Hanafi, Samira; Gizaw Assefa, Solomon; Oweis, Theib; Baum, Michael",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,"Wheat is the world‟s most widely cultivated cereal. By 2050, global demand for wheat is projected to
increase by 60%. In the CWANA region which ICARDA is tasked to serve, wheat is the basic staple
and food security crop, contributing over 60% of people‟s daily calorific and protein needs. Due to the
large proportion of subsistence farmers, wheat production also has a major impact on household food
security. Despite this, the productivity of wheat in the region is very low (less than 2.5 t/ha) due largely
to the major abiotic (drought, cold, heat, salinity) and biotic (stripe rust, leaf rust, stem rust and Hessian
fly) stresses encountered. Most countries in the region are net importers of wheat for human
consumption, with regional demand predicted to continue rising. Egypt alone currently imports 9
million tons annually. The situation is further complicated by food production shortfalls associated with
climate change which can cause food crises, civil unrest and even migration. The wheat breeding
program at ICARDA has developed high yielding and heat tolerant wheat genotypes which have been
tested and released as cultivars by many countries in the CWANA region. Out-scaling and
intensification of wheat cultivars combined with other improved crop management practices have been
carried out by ICARDA in partnership with the national programs in Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan,
Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen resulting with an average increase of wheat production by
28%. The result clearly indicates that development and utilization of climate smart wheat technologies

One alternative with the potential for widespread contribution toward reducing the impact of reduced feed and water availability is the cactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica). Therefore, the aim of this study was to promote O. ficus-indica as a feed resource for livestock, as it is a drought-resistant succulent plant that is spineless and holds a large amount of water. This study examined the adoption of cactus in Pakistan, through targeting 100 households selected from three strata groups: farmers not familiar with, farmers familiar with, and farmers who had already adopted cactus. Results indicated that there is a general acceptance of cactus by farmers, while farmers stated the lack of available technical or financial means as a reason for their lack of interest in cultivating cactus. The survey also showed that a large number of smallholder farmers are familiar with cactus and are also convinced that it can be adopted for livestock feeding. In conclusion, cactus has huge potential in Pakistan as a non-conventional and valuable fodder for resource-challenged areas, especially since farmers have very positive attitudes toward cactus adoption.

Influence of CO2 and Temperature on Metabolism and Development of Helicoverpa armigera (Noctuidae: Lepidoptera),"Akbar, Mohammad S.; Sharma, Hari C.; Pavani, E.",International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics - ICRISAT,"Climate change will have a major bearing on survival and development of insects as a result of increase in CO2 and temperature. Therefore, we studied the direct effects of CO2 and temperature on larval development and metabolism in cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner). The larvae were reared under a range of CO2 (350, 550, and 750 ppm) and temperature (15, 25, 35, and 45°C) regimes on artificial diet. Elevated CO2 negatively affected the larval survival, larval weight, larval period, pupation, and adult emergence, but showed a positive effect on pupal weight, pupal period, and fecundity. Increase in temperature exhibited a negative effect on larval survival, larval period, pupal weights, and pupal period, but a positive effect on larval growth. Pupation and adult emergence were optimum at 25°C. Elevated CO2 and temperature increased food consumption and metabolism of larvae by enhancing the activity of midgut proteases, carbohydrases (amylase and cellulase), and mitochondrial enzymes and therefore may cause more damage to crop production. Elevated CO2 and global warming will affect insect growth and development, which will change the interactions between the insect pests and their crop hosts.

Country-Level Bio-Economic Modeling of Agricultural Technologies to Enhance Wheat-Based Systems Productivity in the Dry Areas,"Frija, Aymen; Telleria, Roberto",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,"Conservation Agriculture (CA) have a large potential for enhancing cereal yields in the semi-arid areas through
better management of soil moisture. The objective of the current paper is to quantify, at national level, the impact
of CA adoption in wheat-based agricultural systems in Syria. A country-level bio-economic approach was used
for this purpose. Different CA technical packages (TPs) were first developed and simulated through APSIM crop
modeling software, in order to estimate the long-term yields of wheat under different CA TPs for the period
2015-2039. The considered CA packages are a combination of zero-tillage, mulching, raised bed, fertilizer doses,
and planting dates. The simulated yields are then introduced into IMPACT model while assuming that TPs will
be adopted on 35% of the wheat areas in the countries. Results show that the comparative advantages of CA TPs
on overcoming the effect of climate change will only be significant after 2030. In 2039, the effect of different
TPs on average wheat yields in Syria will be 4% to 12% (depending on the TP) higher than the average yields
under climate change and no CA technology adoption. These yield enhancements may reduce the wheat trade
deficit with 30 up to 140%, also depending on the technical package. The combination of mulching techniques,
together with average nitrogen dose of 30kg/ha, and late planting date of wheat provides the best prospective for

However, phylogenetic relationships within Prunus at low taxonomic level, particularly in the subgenus Amygdalus L. s.l., remain poorly investigated. This paper attempts to document the evolutionary history of Amygdalus s.l. and establishes a temporal framework, by assembling molecular data from conservative and variable molecular markers. The nuclear s6pdh gene in combination with the plastid trnSG spacer are analyzed with bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. Since previous phylogenetic analysis with these markers lacked resolution, we additionally analyzed 13 nuclear SSR loci with the delta A mu(2) distance, followed by an unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages algorithm. Our phylogenetic analysis with both sequence and SSR loci confirms the split between sections Amygdalus and Persica, comprising almonds and peaches, respectively. This result is in agreement with biogeographic data showing that each of the two sections is naturally distributed on each side of the Central Asian Massif chain. Using coalescent based estimations, divergence times between the two sections strongly varied when considering sequence data only or combined with SSR. The sequence-only based estimate (5 million years ago) was congruent with the Central Asian Massif orogeny and subsequent climate change. Given the low level of differentiation within the two sections using both marker types, the utility of combining microsatellites and data sequences to address phylogenetic relationships at low taxonomic level within Amygdalus is discussed. The recent evolutionary histories of almond and peach are discussed in view of the domestication processes that arose in these two phenotypically-diverging gene pools: almonds and peaches were domesticated from the Amygdalus s.s. and Persica sections, respectively.

Efficiency of Plant Breeding,"Ceccarelli, Salvatore",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,"Participatory plant breeding (PPB) has been practiced for several reasons, including sociological, humanitarian, and egalitarian. This paper aims to demonstrate that PPB should be practiced simply because it increases plant breeding efficiency, which is defined as (i) the ratio between the number of varieties adopted and the number of crosses made, (ii) the response to selection, and (iii) the benefit/cost ratio, not only as often done by public breeding programs, by the number of varieties released by public breeding programs. After reviewing the reasons for the lack of adoption of several of the varieties released, and the theoretical basis justifying the use of correlated response to measure selection gains, the issue of the benefit/cost ratio is discussed within the context of adoption rates. The assumption is that without adoption, no benefit will occur. Ways to increase the three measures of breeding efficiency are discussed in detail, and the conclusion is made that the three measures can be increased by combining decentralized selection with farmers' participation in a PPB program. The essential features of a PPB program are reviewed, including the experimental designs and statistical analysis used to increase the precision of on-farm trials. The findings show that PPB increases breeding efficiency, both in terms of response to selection measured over the time from the initial cross to adoption and in terms of the benefit/cost ratio as a consequence of a higher adoption rate. In a PPB program, adoption starts during the process of selection and precedes variety release. In a conventional plant breeding (CPB) program, the sequence is reversed. Other differences between a PPB and a CPB program include the increase of agrobiodiversity, which in a PPB program is higher because of the rapid spatiotemporal turnover of varieties, and because the seed of new varieties is readily available to farmers, thus contributing to food security. Because of its decentralized nature, PPB can accommodate organic farms and become easily adopted by both national and international public breeding programs as one way of adapting crops to climate changes.","European Union, European Commission - EU-EC",en,https://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2014.02.0158,Open access,CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/13054,2015-02-01,2015-01-01,Crop Science,0011-183X,Crop Science Society of America,55,1,87-97,wheat; selection; landraces; adoption; environments; grain-yield; and the conclusion is made that the three measures can be increased by combining decentralized selection with farmers' participation in a ppb program. the essential features of a ppb program are reviewed; articipatory crop improvement; agricultural-research; adaptation strategy; biodiversity loss,
Application of systematic monitoring and mapping techniques: Assessing land restoration potential in semi-arid lands of Kenya,"Winowiecki, Leigh; Vagen, Tor-Gunnar; Kinnaird, Margaret; O'Brien, Timothy",World Agroforestry Center - ICRAF; World Wildlife Fund - WWF; Wildlife Conservation Society - WCS,"Drylands cover over 40% of the earth's surface and support over 2 billion people, globally (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). In East Africa alone, over 250 million people depend on drylands for their livelihoods (De Leeuw et al., 2014) and in Kenya, 70% of the total land area is classiﬁed as arid- and semi-arid (Batjes, 2004). Over the last several decades, an increasing and more sedentary human population has resulted in more pressure on these lands, and an expansion of agricultural production into marginal dryland areas that were traditionally rangelands. The result is widespread soil loss and land degradation, as well as increased pressure on protected areas and more frequent human-wildlife conﬂict in Kenya (Laikipia Wildlife Forum, 2012;Nyamwamu,2016).Thesefactors,combinedwithclimate change and erratic rainfall, continue to increase the vulnerability ofdrylands in East Africa (Darkoh, 1998). However, drylands are also considered to have an important role in mitigating climate change (Lal, 2004; Neely et al., 2009; Neely and De Leeuw, 2008), are important biodiversity hot-spots and support a diversity of livelihoods (Mortimore, 2009). While land degradation is recognized as a major cause of low agricultural and rangeland productivity, estimates of land degradation within the drylands remain poor and hence also vary widely.

Soil-landscape modeling and land suitability evaluation: the case of rainwater harvesting in a dry rangeland environment,"Al-Shamiri, Anwar; Ziadat, Feras M.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; University of Jordan - JU,"The arid to semi-arid region is characterized by a scarcity of land and water resources, which threatens the livelihoods of the inhabitants. Rainwater harvesting is an important practice to improve water and land productivity and to cope with climate change in the drier marginal environments. The accurate determination of the location and types of rainwater harvesting interventions through a land suitability assessment is key to successful implementation. However, adequate information about land resources is needed. Unfortunately, the arid areas suffer from a scarcity of detailed soil information and preparation of this data is often costly and time consuming. This research examines the utility of modern soil-landscape modeling techniques to provide soil and topographic information that improves land suitability assessment. The suitability of the land for two types of rainwater harvesting – contour ridges and runoff strips – to grow range crops (Atriplex – Atriplex halimus) or field crops (barley – Hordeum vulgare) was examined. Two methods were compared for an area of 26 km2 – spatial interpolation between observations (inverse distance weighted) using 108 points, and a soil-landscape prediction model that used terrain attributes derived from a digital elevation model (DEM). Soil depth was predicted to within ±40 cm for 89% of the field observations and surface stoniness was predicted to within ±20% for 82% using the soil-landscape model. The corresponding values using the spatial interpolation model were 81% and 73%. The agreement between the suitability classes derived from field observations and those derived from the soil-landscape prediction model was slightly better than those derived from the interpolation model. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the suitability classification derived from the soil-landscape prediction model shows a more realistic pattern and better identification of extreme land characteristics, such as rocky areas and deep soils.

Spatiotemporal patterns of paddy rice croplands in China and India from 2000 to 2015,"Zhang, Geli; Xiao, Xiangming; Biradar, Chandrashekhar; Dong, Jinwei; Qin, Yuanwei; Menarguez, Michael Angelo; Zhou, Yuting; Zhang, Yao; Jin, Cui; Wang, Jie; Doughty, Russell; Ding, Mingjun; Moore III, Berrien","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; University of Oklahoma - OU; University of Oklahoma, Center for Spatial Analysis - OU - CSA; University of Oklahoma, College of Arts and Sciences - OU - CAS; University of Oklahoma, College of Atmospheric and Geographic Science - OU - AGS","Due to rapid population growth and urbanization, paddy rice agriculture is experiencing substantial changes in the spatiotemporal pattern of planting areas in the two most populous countries—China and India—where food security is always the primary concern. However, there is no spatially explicit and continuous rice-planting information in either country. This knowledge gap clearly hinders our ability to understand the effects of spatial paddy rice area dynamics on the environment, such as food and water security, climate change, and zoonotic infectious disease transmission. To resolve this problem, we first generated annual maps of paddy rice planting areas for both countries from 2000 to 2015, which are derived from time series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and the phenology- and pixel-based rice mapping platform (RICE-MODIS), and analyzed the spatiotemporal pattern of paddy rice dynamics in the two countries. We found that China experienced a general decrease in paddy rice planting area with a rate of 0.72 million (m) ha/yr from 2000 to 2015, while a significant increase at a rate of 0.27 m ha/yr for the same time period happened in India. The spatial pattern of paddy rice agriculture in China shifted northeastward significantly, due to simultaneous expansions in paddy rice planting areas in northeastern China and contractions in southern China. India showed an expansion of paddy rice areas across the entire country, particularly in the northwestern region of the Indo-Gangetic Plain located in north India and the central and south plateau of India. In general, there has been a northwesterly shift in the spatial pattern of paddy rice agriculture in India. These changes in the spatiotemporal patterns of paddy rice planting area have raised new concerns on how the shift may affect national food security and environmental issues relevant to water, climate, and biodiversity.",CGIAR System Organization - CGIAR,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.223,Limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/6314,2017-02-01,2016-11-17,Science of the Total Environment,0048-9697,Elsevier,579,,82-92,agriculture; food security; india; china; modis; rice; paddy rice; phenology-based algorithm,CN; IN

approach. Yet, to what extent the projects are guided by ecological restoration principles remains largely
unknown. To analyse this issue, we built an on-line survey addressed to restoration practitioners. We analysed 36 restoration projects, mostly from drylands (86%). The projects used mainly soil from local
sources. The need to comply with legislation was more important as a restoration motive for European Union
(EU) than for non-EU countries, while public opinion and health had a greater importance in the latter. Non-
EU countries relied more on non-native plant species than EU countries, thus deviating from ecological restoration
guidelines. Nursery-grown plants used weremostly of local or regional provenance,whilst seedsweremostly
of national provenance. Unexpected restoration results (e.g. inadequate biodiversity)were reported for 50% of
the projects and restoration success was never evaluated in 22%. Long termevaluation (N6 years) was only performed
in 31% of cases, and based primarily on plant diversity and cover. The use of non-native species and species
of exogenous provenances may: i) entail the loss of local genetic and functional trait diversity, critical to cope
with drought, particularly under the predicted climate change scenarios, and ii) lead to unexpected competition
with native species and/or negatively impact local biotic interactions. Absent or inappropriate monitoring may
prevent the understanding of restoration trajectories, precluding adaptive management strategies, often crucial
to create functional ecosystems able to provide ecosystem services. The overview of ecological restoration projects
in theMediterranean Basin revealed high variability among practices and highlighted the need for improved
scientific assistance and information exchange, greater use of native species of local provenance, and more longterm

multifunctional landscapes of the Mo river basin in Togo. We (1) quantified the potential storages of SOC

(2) highlighted the relationships among these soil chemical properties, in-situ ecological conditions, and
other hypothesized controlling factors. We used soil data from 75 sample sites to determine the quantity
of SOC and TN at two depths (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm). In-situ ecological variables were collected
simultaneously during soil sampling. Spatial information on biophysical conditions of the study sites
were obtained from satellite images and most updated global topographic and soil databases. The results
showed that SOC and TN varied significantly according to land cover types, soil depths, topographical
positions and land protection regime. Generally, forests and woodland contain highest SOC (4%) and TN
(0.3%). Agricultural fields (fallowed and cultivating farms) exhibited the lowest values of SOC and TN,
except in some selected farm sites where these chemicals are still high. Topsoil layer (0–10 cm) contribute
up to 60% of the total nutrient contents in soils. The sequential multivariate statistical approach
unpacked and quantified the effects of inter-dependent ecological, management and landform drivers

Rainwater harvesting for restoring degraded dry agro-pastoral ecosystems: a conceptual review of opportunities and constraints in a changing climate,"Oweis, Theib","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Tottori University, the International Platform for Dryland Research and Education - Tottori - IPDRE","Water resources in dry environments are becoming scarcer, especially under the changing climate. In response, rainwater harvesting (RWH) is being reemphasized with calls to revive the practice. Ancient knowledge on RWH - mainly the collection through runoff, storage, and use of rainwater for various purposes - is still relevant, especially for dry environments. However, many old practices and technologies may not be suitable or feasible for the present and future. Little has been done to modernize and (or) develop new practices and technologies based on ancient indigenous knowledge. Modernizing old practices or developing new ones and using them in integrated rangelands restoration packages with enabling policy environment can unlock their potential in many water-scarce regions of the world. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of micro-catchment rainwater harvesting (MIRWH) in dry environments and discusses the opportunities available and the major obstacles faced in using it to restore degraded agro-pastoral ecosystems and support their sustainability. The review highlights the knowledge behind it, the practices developed over the years, and their relevance to today and the future. The paper indicates areas of modernization that can make it more feasible for the future of the dry environments, especially their role in mitigating and adapting to climate change. Conventional and passive approaches to restoring/rehabilitating degraded dry agro-pastoral ecosystems are either too slow to show an obvious impact or not progressing satisfactorily. One main reason is that, because of land degradation, the majority of rain falling on such ecosystems and needed for revegetation is lost with little benefit being gained. Adopting a more progressive intervention to alter the processes of degradation and move towards new system equilibrium is required. MIRWH can enable a large portion of this otherwise lost rainwater to be stored in the soil, and, if used in an integrated packages including suitable plant species and sound grazing management, it may support meaningful vegetation growth and help system restoration. The Badia Benchmark project, implemented by ICARDA in Jordan and Syria, has demonstrated the potential for adoption at large scale in similar environments.

under different management practices. Results show high model accuracy with excellent agreement between simulated
and observed values for crop phenology and leaf number per plant. The prediction of grain yield and total biomass of
an early maturing variety was fair RMSEn (22.9 and 23.1%), while that of the medium maturing was highly accurate
RMSEn (14.9 and 11.9%). Sensitivity analysis performed by changing the calibrated variables of key plant traits in the
model, showed higher significant yield change by+or - 10 % changed in radiation use efficiency, (RUE), coefficient
extinction (Coeff_ext) and Phyllocron (Phyllo) for early maturing variety while +or - 10 % changed in phyllochron
and RUE showed a significant yield change for the medium maturing variety. Under climate change scenerios using
RCP 8.5, the simulated yield for the early–maturing variety revealed high inter-annual variability and potential yield
loss of 3.3% at Bamako and 1% at Kano in the near-future (2010–2039) compared to baseline (1980–2009). The midcentury
(2040–2069) projected yield decline by 4.8% at Bamako and 6.2% at Kano compared to baseline (1980–2009).
On the contrary, the medium maturing variety indicated significantly yield gain with high yielding potential in both climate regimes compared to the baseline period (1980–2009). The simulated grain yield increased by 7.2% at Bamako and 4.6% at Kano, in the near-future (2010–2039) while in the mid-century (2040–2069) projected yield increase of 12.3% and 2% at Bamako and Kano compared to baseline (1980–2009). Adaptation strategies under climate change for varying sowing dates in the near-future (2010–2039, indicated that June sowing had a higher positive yield gained over July and August sowing for early maturing variety; July sowing simulated positive gained by 5 -11% over June and August sowing for medium maturing variety in both locations. Similarly, under the mid-century (2040–2069), among the sowing dates and in both locations, June sowing indicates lowest negative yield change over July and August sowing for early maturing variety. However, for medium maturing variety, July sowing had the highest yield gain of 16% over June and August sowing at Bamako and June highest positive yield gained of 11.4% over July and August at Kano.

Besides providing basic nutrition, they have great potential for boosting human health. The balanced consumption of vegetables is highly recommended for supplementing the human body with better nutrition density, dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and bioactive compounds. However, the production and quality of fresh vegetables are influenced directly or indirectly by exposure to high temperatures or heat stress (HS). A decline in quality traits and harvestable yield are the most common effects of HS among vegetable crops. Heat-induced morphological damage, such as poor vegetative growth, leaf tip burning, and rib discoloration in leafy vegetables and sunburn, decreased fruit size, fruit/pod abortion, and unfilled fruit/pods in beans, are common, often rendering vegetable cultivation unprofitable. Further studies to trace down the possible physiological and biochemical effects associated with crop failure reveal that the key factors include membrane damage, photosynthetic inhibition, oxidative stress, and damage to reproductive tissues, which may be the key factors governing heat-induced crop failure. The reproductive stage of plants has extensively been studied for HS-induced abnormalities. Plant reproduction is more sensitive to HS than the vegetative stages, and affects various reproductive processes like pollen germination, pollen load, pollen tube growth, stigma receptivity, ovule fertility and, seed filling, resulting in poorer yields. Hence, sound and robust adaptation and mitigation strategies are needed to overcome the adverse impacts of HS at the morphological, physiological, and biochemical levels to ensure the productivity and quality of vegetable crops. Physiological traits such as the stay-green trait, canopy temperature depression, cell membrane thermostability, chlorophyll fluorescence, relative water content, increased reproductive fertility, fruit numbers, and fruit size are important for developing better yielding heat-tolerant varieties/cultivars. Moreover, various molecular approaches such as omics, molecular breeding, and transgenics, have been proved to be useful in enhancing/incorporating tolerance and can be potential tools for developing heat-tolerant varieties/cultivars. Further, these approaches will provide insights into the physiological and molecular mechanisms that govern thermotolerance and pave the way for engineering “designer” vegetable crops for better health and nutritional security. Besides these approaches, agronomic methods are also important for adaptation, escape and mitigation of HS protect and improve yields.",Indian Council of Agricultural Research - ICAR,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.878498,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/68219,,2022-06-28,Frontiers in Plant Science,1664-462X,Frontiers Media,13,,,climate change; environment; heat; vegetables; high temperature; rice; lentil,

To investigate changes in SOC under conservation agriculture (CA), we measured SOC concentrations after seven years of rice (Oryza sativa L.)–wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotations in the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of India under various combinations of tillage and crop establishment methods. The six treatments were as follows: conventional till transplanted rice followed by conventional till wheat (CTR-CTW), CTR followed by zero-till wheat (CTR-ZTW), ZT direct-seeded rice followed by CTW (ZTDSR-CTW), ZTDSR followed by ZT wheat both on permanent raised beds with residue (PBDSR-PBW+R), and ZTDSR followed by ZTW both with (ZTDSR-ZTW+R) and without residues (ZTDSR-ZTW). We hypothesized that CA systems (i.e. ZT with residue retention) would sequester more carbon (C) than CT. After seven years, ZTDSR- ZTW+R and PBDSR-PBW+R increased SOC at 0–0.6 m depth by 4.7 and 3.0 t C/ha, respectively, whereas the CTR-CTW system resulted in a decrease in SOC of 0.9 t C/ha. Over the same soil depth, ZT without residue retention (ZTDSR-ZTW) only increased SOC by 1.1 t C/ha. There was no increase in SOC where ZT in either rice or wheat was followed by CT in the next crop (i.e. CTR- ZTW and ZTDSR-CTW), most likely because the benefit of ZT is lost when followed by tillage. Tillage and crop establishment methods had no significant effect on the SOC stock below the 0.15-m soil layer. Over the seven years, the total carbon input from above-ground residues was ca. 14.5 t/ha in ZTDSR-ZTW+R and PBDSR-PBW+R, almost sixfold greater than in the other systems.

Research has shown that precise water management, coupled with improved soil and crop management and decision tools and efficient mechanization with accurate weather forecast can more than double agricultural productivity in rainfed areas with currently low yields. Abiotic stresses aggravated by climate change pose a serious threat to the sustainability of crop yields and account for substantial yield reductions. Plant breeding was highly successful during the second half of the 20th century, contributing substantially to keeping production ahead of population growth. Improved varieties and efficient crop husbandry practices in dryland agriculture resulted in significant increases in the productivity of cereals, grain legumes, and fodder crops. Breeding achievements in yield and yield stability under dryland agriculture are attributable predominately to genetic improvement of crop species. However, future research to increase the level of drought tolerance in crops needs to address the interaction between a number of traits and assemble those combinations of traits to maximize crop productivity in drought-prone environments. In drylands, timely decision is the most critical to mitigate the risk where efficient mechanization synchronized with accurate weather forecast is the essential component of crop production. Although changes in tillage systems and crop practices can improve production by conserving water, enhancement of the genetic tolerance of crops to drought stress is considered an essential strategy for addressing moisture deficits. Therefore, the main strategies should be focused on capturing the potential of both beneficial genetic adaptations and new technologies for higher productivity in drylands that are increasingly affected by climate change.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1293440,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/69593,,2023-10-04,Frontiers in Environmental Science,2296-665X,Frontiers Media,11,,,crop production; modelling; adaptability; rainfed areas; soil fertility 12 13,

The North Africa region falls under an arid or semi-arid climate and is considered as a hot spot for climate change. To combat feed shortages, increase the income of the rural poor and mitigate the effect of climate change, around 1 million ha of cactus crop has been planted in Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco. Aware of the importance of germplasm, ex-situ collections are being initiated in the region, where promising accessions have been introduced from many countries. The objective of this contribution was to assess the genetic diversity of 20 cactus pear accessions from the ex-situ collection located at the INRA Morocco research station in Agadir using morphological characterization based on FAO Cactusnet descriptors. The data were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) using the XLSTAT 2015 package. The results showed that the accessions can be discriminated by some of the morphological descriptors. Many of these morphological descriptors were significantly correlated, such as number of cladodes and number of fruits (r=0.73), number of cladodes and plant diameter (r=0.73), length of the cladode and plant height (r=0.7), and length of spines and number of areoles (r=0.67). Cladode shape and the number of spines and areoles are the recommended descriptors, since they were capable of discriminating accessions with suitable accuracy. Other descriptors do not seem to influence the morphological characterization, including cladode thickness, number of spines, plant height, and cladode shape index. Therefore, PCA and AHC are efficient tools for segregating accessions using a reduced number of morphological descriptors. Another important finding is that the number of morphological descriptors may be reduced without potential risk of reducing the accuracy of the phenotypic characterization for this particular collection and location.",International Livestock Research Institute - ILRI,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1247.23,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/10399,,2019-08-12,Acta Horticulturae,0567-7572,International Society for Horticultural Science (ISHS),1247,,163-170,multivariate analysis; cactus pears; phenotypic characterization; genetic diversity; morphological descriptors,MA

Large-scale assessments have become an important tool to quantify the impacts of global climate change and water use changes on water resources sustainability. The major components comprising the water demand and the supply are estimated by such assessments using  global earth system models and national level census datasets. The selection of appropriate spatial and temporal scales for the major components of water demand and supply is critical. The grid-based global earth system models enable various spatial resampling of water information over the country/political boundaries. Recent studies observed that by refining temporal scale from annual (the most commonly used temporal scale of assessment) to monthly time steps, water scarcity is better captured due to the distinctive seasonality of water availability and demand. In addition, the major drivers of water scarcity are discussed as an important criterion. Although both changing climate and increase in water demand contribute to the sustainability of water use, the majority of the literature concludes that the magnitude of demand driven fresh water scarcity is much greater than that by climate. Further, many studies neglect the environmental flows in large-scale assessments which results in under estimation of water scarcity.

"Impact of rangeland enclosure and seasonal grazing on protected and  unprotected rangelands in Chakwal region, Pakistan","Islam, Muhammad; Razzaq, Abdul; Zubair, Muhammad; Hassan, Sawsan; Ahmad, Sarfraz; Gul, Shamim; Rischkowsky, Barbara; Louhaichi, Mounir",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; International Livestock Research Institute - ILRI; Pakistan Agricultural Research Council - PARC; McGill University; Bahauddin Zakariya University - BZU; University of Balochistan - UOB Pakistan,"Scrub rangelands support livestock grazing and provide ecosystem services to their inhabitants. The present study was conducted in Chakwal, an important tract of the Pothwar Plateau, which sustains herds of small domestic and nomadic ruminants. Urbanization and uncontrolled grazing practices have reduced rangeland productivity and increased soil erosion and resulted in poor land conditions. This study assessed the influence of two years of rangeland protection on aboveground vegetation biomass and the chemical composition of plants and aimed to determine the influence of seasonal grazing on the live-weight gain of small ewes. Using the line intercept method, vegetation data from protected and unprotected plots in 2015 and 2016 were collected at two sites, Dhulli and Begal. Vegetation cover was assessed from images using VegMeasure. Results showed that protected study sites displayed higher vegetation biomass (834 and 690 kg ha-1) compared to the unprotected study site (477 and 326 kg ha-1) during April and August of both years. In the seasonal grazing trial, the experimental ewes that grazed on protected rangelands showed higher live-weight gain (33–63 g day-1) compared to live weight of ewes (17–21 g day-1) that grazed on unprotected rangelands during the experimental period of 127 days at both sites. The results suggest that the Chakwal rangeland has tremendous potential to improve vegetation productivity but modern livestock management and seasonal grazing practices are needed to improve carrying capacity and livestock productivity.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; United States Agency for International Development - USAID; CGIAR System Organization - CGIAR,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-021-6761-z,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/67727,,2022-04-13,Journal of Mountain Science,1672-6316,Springer (part of Springer Nature),19,,46-57,climate change; productivity; rangelands; goal 13 climate action; seasonal grazing; climate adaptation and mitigation; protected area,PK
Quantification of the Land Potential for Scaling Agroforestry in South Asia,"Ahmad, Firoz; Uddin, Md. Meraj; Goparaju, Laxmi; Rizvi, Javed; Biradar, Chandrashekhar",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; World Agroforestry Center - ICRAF; Vindhyan Ecology and Natural History Foundation; Ranchi University,"Trees are an integral part of the sustainable farming practices that can withstand extreme weather events, pest risks, and optimize land and water productivity to achieve food, fuel, fodder and nutritional security while safeguarding the environmental flows. This study was undertaken to analyze the landscape potential for the South Asian region in the geospatial domain utilizing the FAO’s land suitability criteria. The key datasets were derived from satellite remote sensing at a global and regional scale for land, soil, climate, and topography and were used to model the agroforestry suitability across South Asia. Furthermore, the agroforestry suitability categories and tree cover dominance were investigated with respect to the total geographical area, agriculture land cover and with climate variables to understand the present and future trends. The comprehensive analysis revealed that 69% of the total geographical area retains 55% and greater suitability for agroforestry. The analysis revealed that nearly 73.4% of the landscape is absent (0%) of tree cover, 7.1%, shows 1–10% and 19.5% area having more than 10% tree cover. The tree dominance/hotspot analyses in the agriculture land were found notably high in 
the multiple farming components such as home gardens. The single crop of irrigated and rain-fed croplands showed high land suitability towards agroforestry. Such land can be utilized to enhance the tree cover that suits locally as per the farmer’s need based on a community-driven participatory approach to bring the sustainability and resilience in degraded landscapes (FAO in Agroforestry for landscape restoration, 2017). The future climate data analysis showed a significant change in the distribution of temperature and precipitation that will influence future farming practices in South Asia. The agroforestry
suitability and tree cover mapping results/analysis will assist crucially the agroforestry policymakers/planners in the various South Asian countries to implement and extend it to the new area. The analysis clearly shows that the advent of big data, remote sensing and GIS provide insights into the agroforestry interventions and scaling which further helps in building resilient landscapes for sustainable agri-food systems, livelihoods, safeguarding the environmental security and supporting some of the important sustainable development goals (SDGs).",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42489-020-00045-0,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/12448,,2020-05-04,KN - Journal of Cartography and Geographic Information,2524-4957,Springer Nature Switzerland,70,,71-89,agroforestry; climate change; gis; south asia; land evaluation; tree cover,BD; IN; NP; PK; AF
"Towards the conservation of crop wild relative diversity in North Africa: checklist, prioritisation and inventory","Lala, Sami; Amri, Ahmed; Maxted, Nigel",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Independent / Not associated; Birmingham City University - BCU,"Crop wild relatives (CWR) are wild species that are more or less genetically related to crops that can be used to introgress useful genes for improvement of productivity, resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and quality of cultivated crops. They are important in crop improvement to achieve food security for an increasing population and to overcome the challenges caused by climate change and the new virulence of major diseases and pests. These genetic resources are increasingly threatened in their natural habitats through over-exploitation and land reclamation and degradation. Therefore, their efficient and effective conservation would be taxonomically and genetically valuable and will contribute to maintaining and promoting the sustainability of crop diversity, facilitating agricultural production and supporting the increasing demand for food, feed and natural resources. A checklist of 5780 Crop Wild Relatives (CWR) taxa from North Africa was obtained using the CWR Catalogue for Europe and the Mediterranean (PGR Forum). Of which consists 76% of the flora of North Africa. The checklist contains 5588 (~97%) native taxa and 192 introduced. Families with higher taxa richness are Fabaceae, Asteraceae, and Poaceae. These three families constitute more than 33% of the total taxa included in the checklist. About 9% (502) CWR taxa identified as a priority for conservation in North Africa using four criteria, the economic value of the crop, the relatedness degree of wild relatives to their crop, threat status using IUCN red list assessment, and finally the centre of origin and/or diversity of the crop. Of these, 112 taxa were assigned high, 268 medium and 122 low priorities for effective conservation. Those assessed as threatened using IUCN Red list and national assessment represent approximately 2% (119 taxa) of the CWR in the region. However, 21 taxa are assessed as critically endangered (CR), 53 as endangered (EN), and 45 as vulnerable (VU). Wild relatives of some globally important crops are present, with those related to wheat (Triticum aestivum L. and T. durum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgareL.) among the highest priority crops for the North Africa region. Amongst CWR assessed as threatened, only 8 (6.7%) CWR are related to food crops, Avena agadiriana B.R. Baum. et G. Fedak (VU), A. atlantica B.R. Baum et G. Fedak (VU), A. murphyi Ladiz. (EN), Beta macrocarpa Guss. (EN), Olea europaea subsp. maroccana Guss. (VU), Rorippa hayanicaMaire (VU) and Aegilops bicornis (Forssk.) Jaub. et Spach (VU).

Phenotypic and Genotypic Diversity Among Symbiotic and Non-symbiotic Bacteria Present in Chickpea Nodules in Morocco,"Benjelloun, Imane; Thami Alami, Imane; Douira, Allal; Udupa, Sripada M.","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; National Institute of Agronomic Research Morocco - INRA Morocco; Ibn Tofail University, Faculty of Sciences - UIT - FS; Ibn Tofail University - UIT Morocco","Environmental pollution problems and increased demand for green technologies in production are forcing farmers to introduce agricultural practices with a lower impact on the environment. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) in arid and semi-arid environments is frequently affected by harsh environmental stresses such as heat, drought and salinity, which limit its growth and productivity and affect biological nitrogen ﬁxation ability of rhizobia. Climate change had further aggravated these stresses. Inoculation with appropriate stress tolerant rhizobia is necessary for an environmentally friendly and sustainable agricultural production. In this study, endophytic bacteria isolated from chickpea nodules from different soil types and regions in Morocco, were evaluated for their phenotypic and genotypic diversity in order to select the most tolerant ones for further inoculation of this crop. Phenotypic characterization of 135 endophytic bacteria from chickpea nodules showed a wide variability for tolerance to heavy metals and antibiotics, variable response to extreme temperatures, salinity, pH and water stress. 56% of isolates were able to nodulate chickpea. Numerical analysis of rep-PCR results showed that nodulating strains fell into 22 genotypes. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene of endophytic bacteria from chickpea nodules revealed that 55% of isolated bacteria belong to Mesorhizobium genus. Based on MLSA of core genes (recA, atpD, glnII and dnaK), tasted strains were distributed into six clades and were closely related to Mesorhizobium ciceri, Mesorhizobium opportunistum, Mesorhizobium qingshengii, and Mesorhizobium plurifarium. Most of nodulating strains were belonging to a group genetically distinct from reference Mesorhizobium species. Three isolates belong to genus Burkholderia of the class β- proteobacteria, and 55 other strains belong to the class γ- proteobacteria. Some of the stress tolerant isolates have great potential for further inoculation of chickpea in the arid and semiarid environments to enhance biological nitrogen ﬁxation and productivity in the context of climate change adaptation and mitigation.",Government of Morocco - Morocco,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01885,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/10285,,2019-09-18,Frontiers in Microbiology,1664-302X,Frontiers Media,10:1885,,1-19,cicer arietinum; mlsa; rhizobia; endophytic bacteria; gamma proteobacteria; beta proteobacteria,MA

This study aims to uncover the mechanisms underlying heat and drought tolerance in lentil accessions. To achieve this objective, twelve accessions were subjected to high-temperature stress (32/20 °C), while seven accessions underwent assessment under drought stress conditions (50% of field capacity) during the reproductive stage. Our findings revealed a significant increase in catalase activity across all accessions under both stress conditions, with ILL7814 and ILL7835 recording the highest accumulations of 10.18 and 9.33 under drought stress, respectively, and 14 µmol H2O2 mg protein−1 min−1 under high temperature. Similarly, ascorbate peroxidase significantly increased in all tolerant accessions due to high temperatures, with ILL6359, ILL7835, and ILL8029 accumulating the highest values with up 50 µmol ascorbate mg protein−1 min−1. In contrast, no significant increase was obtained for all accessions subjected to water stress, although the drought-tolerant accessions accumulated more APX activity (16.59 t to 25.08 µmol ascorbate mg protein−1 min−1) than the sensitive accessions. The accessions ILL6075, ILL7814, and ILL8029 significantly had the highest superoxide dismutase activity under high temperature, while ILL6363, ILL7814, and ILL7835 accumulated the highest values under drought stress, each with 22 to 25 units mg protein−1. Under both stress conditions, ILL7814 and ILL7835 recorded the highest contents in proline (38 to 45 µmol proline/g FW), total flavonoids (0.22 to 0.77 mg QE g−1 FW), total phenolics (7.50 to 8.79 mg GAE g−1 FW), total tannins (5.07 to 20 µg CE g−1 FW), and total antioxidant activity (60 to 70%). Further, ILL7814 and ILL6338 significantly recorded the highest total soluble sugar content under high temperature (71.57 and 74.24 mg g−1, respectively), while ILL7835 achieved the maximum concentration (125 mg g−1) under drought stress.

encouraging the adoption of ‘climate-smart’ agricultural technologies, such as conservation
agriculture (CA). However, there is little rigorous evidence that demonstrates the effect of CA
on production or climate resilience, and what evidence exists is hampered by selection bias.
Using panel data from Zimbabwe, we test how CA performs during extreme rainfall events -
both shortfalls and surpluses.We control for the endogenous adoption decision and find that
use of CA in years of average rainfall results in no yield gains, and in some cases yield loses.
However, CA is effective in mitigating the negative impacts of deviations in rainfall. We conclude
that the lower yields during normal rainfall seasons may be a proximate factor in low

Modeling genotype × environment × management interactions for a sustainable intensification under rainfed wheat cropping system in Morocco,"Mamassi, Achraf; Balaghi, Riad; Devkota, Krishna; Bouras, Hamza; El‑Gharous, Mohamed; Tychon, Bernard",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Institute of Agronomy and Veterinary Hassan II - IAV HASSAN II; National Institute of Agronomic Research Morocco - INRA Morocco; Mohammed VI Polytechnic University - UM6P; University of Liège - ULIEGE,"Under the conditions of Moroccan rainfed agricultural areas, wheat cropping systems—the population’s basic staple food—are subject to a set of limitations that seasonally impact crop production and farmers’ incomes, thus national food security. In the last decades, the major constraints were often related to the country’s Mediterranean-type climate, through the intense recurrence of drought events and high inter- and intra-annual rainfall fluctuations. Similarly, various forms of soil degradation inhibit the potential of this slowly renewable resource to support wheat crop intensification and ensure livelihoods. However, the limitations sometimes surpass the environmental factors to implicate the inappropriate crop management strategies applied by farmers. In Moroccan rainfed areas, production problems linked to crop management practices result principally from a shortage in the provision of knowledge to Moroccan small farmers, or their indigent economic situation that limits farmers’ capacity to adopt, qualitatively and quantitatively, efficient strategies. Advanced technologies (remote sensing or crop modeling) play key roles in assessing wheat cropping systems in Moroccan rainfed areas. Due to the difficulties of using conventional experience-based agronomic research to understand Genotype × Environment × Management (G × E × M) interactions, the substantial benefits of crop modeling approaches present a better alternative to provide insights. They allow the provision of simpler, rapid, less expensive, deep, and potentially more accurate predictive knowledge and understanding of the status of cropping systems. In the present study, we highlight the constraints that surround wheat cropping systems in Moroccan rainfed conditions. We emphasize the efficiency of applying crop modelling to analyze and improve wheat cropping systems through three main themes: (i) preserving food security, (ii) supporting general adaptation strategies to face climate change effects and extreme events, and (iii) recommending within-season and on-farm crop management advice. Under Moroccan context, crop modeling works have mainly contributed to increase understanding and address the climate change effects on wheat productivity.

It has particularly adverse effects on the ability of the breed to maintain homeothermy. Developing countries are advised to protect and prepare their animal resources in the face of potential threats such as climate change. The current study was conducted in Egypt’s three hot and dry agro-ecological zones. Three local sheep breeds (Saidi, Wahati, and Barki) were studied with a total of 206 ewes. The animals were exercised under natural heat stress. The heat tolerance index of the animals was calculated to identify animals with high and low heat tolerance based on their response to meteorological and physiological parameters. Genomic variation in these breeds was assessed using 64,756 single nucleotide polymorphic markers (SNPs). From the perspective of comparative adaptability to harsh conditions, our objective was to investigate the genomic structure that might control the adaptability of local sheep breeds to environmental stress under hot and dry conditions. In addition, indices of population structure and diversity of local breeds were examined. Measures of genetic diversity showed a significant influence of breed and location on populations. The standardized index of association (rbarD) ranged from 0.0012 (Dakhla) to 0.026 (Assuit), while for the breed, they ranged from 0.004 (Wahati) to 0.0103 (Saidi). The index of association analysis (Ia) ranged from 1.42 (Dakhla) to 35.88 (Assuit) by location and from 6.58 (Wahati) to 15.36 (Saidi) by breed.

"GM Crops, Organic Agriculture and Breeding for Sustainability","Ceccarelli, Salvatore",Rete Semi Rurali,"The ongoing debate about the use of genetically-modified (GM) crops in
agriculture has largely focused on food safety and genetic contamination issues. Given that
the majority of GM crops have been produced to respond to the problem of crop yield
reductions caused by diseases, insects and weeds, the paper argues that in those cases, the
currently used GM crops are an unstable solution to the problem, because they represent
such a strong selection pressure, that pests rapidly evolve resistance. Organic agriculture
practices provide a more sustainable way of producing healthy food; however, the lower
yields often associated with those practices, making the resultant healthy food more
expensive, open the criticism that such practices will not be able to feed human
populations. Evolutionary plant breeding offers the possibility of using the evolutionary
potential of crops to our advantage by producing a continuous flow of varieties better

Safeguarding a global seed heritage from Syria to Svalbard,"Westengen, Ola T.; Lusty, Charlotte; Yazbek, Mariana; Amri, Ahmed; Asdal, Åsmund",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Norwegian University of Life Sciences - NMBU; Global Crop Diversity Trust - GCDT; Nordic Genetic Resources Center (NordGen),"Crop diversity underpins food security and adaptation to climate change. Concerted conservation efforts are needed to maintain and make this diversity available to plant scientists, breeders and farmers. Here we present the story of the rescue and reconstitution of the unique seed collection held in the international genebank of International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) in Syria. Being among the first depositors to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, ICARDA managed to safety duplicate more than 80% of its collection before the last staff had to leave the genebank in 2014 because of the war. Based on the safety duplicates, ICARDA since 2015 have rebuilt their collections and resumed distribution of seeds to users internationally from their new premises in Morocco and Lebanon. We describe the multifaceted and layered structure of the global system for the conservation and use of crop diversity that enabled this successful outcome.

Nowadays, these categories become questionable in regard to the evolution of the pattern life of families in southern Morocco. How do we link past and present mobility? What have been the changes? In this article, we question the relevance of the aforementioned categories of mobility, as defined by the actors of scientific research and development, to analyze and classify pastoral mobility management that condition the way of life and the adaptive capacities of Saharan societies, by mobilizing different corpus such as ‘récit de vie’ and typology. This study was conducted downstream in the Drâa Valley (Morocco). If the majority of breeders claim to be nomads as soon as they practice a pattern of living in a tent over the course of a year, the typology of mobility pattern reveals intra- and inter-annual fluctuations of its management embedded in their adaptive strategies to climate variability or economic constraints which makes difficult to classify breeders according to the mobility only. In this context, developing climate change mitigation interventions for pastoral societies need to understand and integrate the permanent changing pattern of mobility management in these pastoral societies.",International Livestock Research Institute - ILRI,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2021.104501,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/13183,,2021-04-05,Journal Of Arid Environments,0140-1963,Elsevier (12 months),189,,,farming systems; nomadism; morocco; camels; pattern of mobility,MA
Introgression of striga resistance into popular Sudanese sorghum varieties using marker assisted selection,"Ali, Rasha; Hash, Charles; Odeny, Damaris; Elhussein, Adil; Mohammed, Abdalla",International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics - ICRISAT; Agricultural Research Corporation - ARC Sudan; University of Khartoum - UofK,"Witchweed (Strigaspp.) is one of the most important cereals production constraints globally and is projected to worsen with anticipated climate change. It is especially a devastating parasitic weed in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. Integrated management strategies that depend mainly on host plant resistance provide the most effective control mechanism for Striga. We used molecular marker-assisted backcrossing to introgress Striga resistance from a resistant genotype, N13, into agronomically important genetic backgrounds (Tabat, Wad and Ahmed). Backcross populations BC3S3 were generated and genotyped using Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) and Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers. A total of 17 promising backcross progenies were selected and screened in Striga infested field alongside their parents. The Area Under Striga Progress Curve (AUSPC) showed significant decrease in Striga count (920-7.5) resulting in a 97-189% increase in yield under Striga pressure.

Targeting perennial vegetation in agricultural landscapes for enhancing ecosystem services,"Asbjornsen, Heidi; Hernandez-Santana, Virginia; Liebman, Matt; Bayala, Jules; Chen, Jiquan; Helmers, Matthew; Schulte, Lisa A","University of New Hampshire, College of Life Sciences and Agriculture - UNH-COLSA; The Spanish National Research Centre,  Institute of Natural Resources and Agrobiology of Seville - CSIC - IRNAS; Iowa State University, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences - IASTATE-CALS; World Agroforestry Center - ICRAF; University of Toledo, College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics - UTOLEDO-NSM","Over the past century, agricultural landscapes worldwide have increasingly been managed for the primary purpose of
producing food, while other diverse ecosystem services potentially available from these landscapes have often been
undervalued and diminished. The incorporation of relatively small amounts of perennial vegetation in strategic locations
within agricultural landscapes dominated by annual crops—or perennialization—creates an opportunity for enhancing
the provision of a wide range of goods and services to society, such as water purification, hydrologic regulation,
pollination services, control of pest and pathogen populations, diverse food and fuel products, and greater resilience to
climate change and extreme disturbances, while at the same time improving the sustainability of food production. This
paper synthesizes the current scientific theory and evidence for the role of perennial plants in balancing conservation with
agricultural production, focusing on the Midwestern USA as a model system, while also drawing comparisons with other
climatically diverse regions of the world. Particular emphasis is given to identifying promising opportunities for

Economic diagnosis showed that no-till system performed best with a gross margin difference of $ 84/ha in comparison with conventional tilled wheat. Moreover, no-till recorded less work time and fuel consumption, with 241 minutes/ha and 42 liters/ha against 624 minutes/ha and 99 liters/ha for conventional tillage. Though, no-till still faced some local social and technical constraints that are relatively easy to overcome. If Algeria put forward its best efforts through increasing no-till in the suitable zones, many objectives could be achieved in the context of preserving natural resources and building up farming sustainability.

Field response of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) to high temperature,"Devasirvatham, V.; Gaur, Pooran",International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics - ICRISAT; University of Sydney,"High temperature is an important factor affecting chickpea growth, development and grain yield. Understanding the plant response to high temperature is a key strategy in breeding for heat tolerance in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). This study assessed genetic variability for heat tolerance in chickpea and identified sources of heat tolerance that could be used for crop improvement. One hundred and sixty-seven genotypes were grown in two environments (heat stressed/late sown and non-stressed/optimal sowing time) in 2 years (2009–2010 and 2010–2011) at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, India. Large genetic variation was observed for phenology, growth, yield components and grain yield. While phenology (assessed as days to first flower, days to 50% flowering and days to first pod) was negatively correlated with grain yield at high temperature; plant biomass, pod number, filled pod number and seed number per plant were positively correlated. Genotypes were classified into short and long duration groups based on their maturity. Days to first flowering (DFF) of long duration genotypes were negatively associated with grain yield under stressed conditions in both years compared with medium to short duration genotypes. However, genotypes varied in their heat sensitivity and temperatures ≥35 °C produced yield losses up to 39%. A heat tolerance index (HTI) classified the genotypes into five groups: (i) stable heat tolerant (>0.5), (ii) moderately heat tolerant (0.1–0.49), (iii) stable heat sensitive (−ve values), (iv) heat tolerant to moderately sensitive (−0.10 to 1) and (v) heat sensitive to moderately tolerant (−0.5 to 0.4). Pod characteristics, including days to first pod and pod number per plant, were correlated with grain yield whereas canopy temperature depression (CTD) was generally not correlated. Heat tolerant genotypes in a range of maturities were identified that could be used to improve the heat tolerance of chickpea.",,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2014.11.017,Limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/7397,,2015-01-23,Field Crops Research,0378-4290,Elsevier,172,,59-71,climate change; crop production; resilience; phenology; canopy temperature depression; genetic variability; high temperature; chickpea; heat tolerance index,

particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Vegetable and legume production and consumption are a potent
mechanism for small-scale, disadvantaged farmers to obtain the required nutrients in their diets and
to generate much-needed income through trade. Vegetables and legumes are key sources of nutrients
and health-promoting phytochemicals, providing higher micronutrient contents and a wider
spectrum of essential compounds to meet nutritional and health needs than other food sources.
Diversifying diets with vegetables and legumes is a cheaper, surer, and more sustainable way to
supply a range of nutrients to the body and combat malnutrition and associated health problems
than other approaches that target only a single or a few nutritional factors. Furthermore, vegetables
and legumes often accompany staple crops in meals, and most staple crops are less palatable without
vegetable or legume accompaniments. As a growing world population demands more and higher

Land degradation drivers of anthropogenic sand and dust storms,"Zucca, Claudio; Fleiner, Renate; Bonaiuti, Enrico; Kang, Utchang","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification - UNCCD; University of Bern, Centre for Development and Environment - CDE; University of Sassari - UNISS","Sand and Dust Storms (SDS) are often considered as a natural phenomenon typical of the remote desert regions. It is becoming clear, however, that human activities also contribute to the increasing global impacts of SDS. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification has recently recognized the global relevance of the anthropogenic SDS sources. These are directly and/or indirectly linked to human activities that make the soils more susceptible to wind erosion, such as unsustainable agricultural practices, overgrazing, deforestation, and misuse of water resources: in other words, the drivers of land degradation. Human activities that contribute to climate change can also be considered as indirect drivers of SDS, as they affect SDS factors like drought patterns and wind regimes. Although the contribution of anthropogenic source areas to total global dust emissions is relatively limited as amount of dust emitted (19–25%), these sources are widespread in almost all environments including drylands, sub-humid and humid areas, and high latitudes.

This article reviews the scientific evidence on the contribution of anthropogenic activities to SDS generation in a variety of SDS hotspots. The contexts considered in this study are associated with different levels of aridity (arid to humid) and with a wide range of land use systems and management practices, human drivers, and land health conditions. On one extreme, like in the Thar Desert of India, SDS are a manifestation of chronic and extensive historical land degradation in arid climatic conditions. On another extreme SDS are occasional events caused by a combination of exceptional weather conditions (e.g., drought spells, windstorms) and of factors increasing soil erodibility locally (e.g., bare fallow or soil disturbance after harvest) and in specific times of the year, as often observed in humid central Europe. Drivers linked to technological activities such as mining, industry, and military operations were also reviewed. Anthropogenic source areas are often of smaller size compared to the natural ones and marked by more scattered distribution patterns. SDS originated from these sources are in some cases occasional and relatively small but can have severe or cumulative impacts on local communities, local residential and transportation structures, and on downwind urban areas.

The majority of SDS studies have mostly addressed large scale events and rarely addressed the distinction between natural and anthropogenic sources. The relationships between the observed impacts of the SDS events and the respective drivers have been poorly studied, as well as the interactions among the SDS drivers, also due to the lack of high resolution and field data on land use and land degradation conditions in the dust source areas. More in-depth research would be needed to understand to what extent the increasing frequency and severity of anthropogenic SDS can be considered as indicators of increasing desertification and reduced land resilience to climate change.","University of Bern, Centre for Development and Environment - CDE",en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106575,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/67629,,2022-08-26,CATENA,0341-8162,Elsevier (12 months),219,,,desertification; sustainable land management; overgrazing; wind erosion; deforestation; slm; bare soil; unsustainable farming,
Soil fertility and crop nutrition research at an international center in the Mediterranean region: achievements and future perspective,"Ryan, John; Sommer, Rolf",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,"The Mediterranean climate allows for rainfed cropping in the relatively moist cool period from autumn to late spring/early summer. Drought has a constant influence. Soil fertility was partly maintained by fallowing, nitrogen-fixing plants, and animal manures. Considerable changes have occurred due to land use pressure, i.e. decreasing fallow and increasing crop diversification, irrigation, and chemical inputs, especially chemical fertilizers. Generally, N use has increased about 20-fold, while phosphate has also increased significantly. Due to adequate reserves in the soils, there is a limited potassium fertilizer use. Awareness of the significance of micronutrients has developed. This presentation gives a broad overview of nutrients in relation to soil properties and crops, emphasizing nutrient dynamics in agroecosystems and nutrient use efficiency. Chemical fertilizers have contributed significantly to increasing crop output in the Mediterranean region.

The simultaneous occurrence of drought and heat stress is also likely to increase, influencing various agronomic characteristics, such as biomass and other growth traits, phenology, and yield-contributing traits, of various crops. At the same time, vital physiological traits will be seriously disrupted, including leaf water content, canopy temperature depression, membrane stability, photosynthesis, and related attributes such as chlorophyll content, stomatal conductance, and chlorophyll fluorescence. Several metabolic processes contributing to general growth and development will be restricted, along with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that negatively affect cellular homeostasis. Plants have adaptive defense strategies, such as ROS-scavenging mechanisms, osmolyte production, secondary metabolite modulation, and different phytohormones, which can help distinguish tolerant crop genotypes. Understanding plant responses to combined drought/heat stress at various organizational levels is vital for developing stress-resilient crops. Elucidating the genomic, proteomic, and metabolic responses of various crops, particularly tolerant genotypes, to identify tolerance mechanisms will markedly enhance the continuing efforts to introduce combined drought/heat stress tolerance.

Effect of protection on plant community dynamics in the Mediterranean arid zone of southern Tunisia: a case study from Bou Hedma national park,"Ouled Belgacem, Azaiez; Tarhouni, Mohamed; Louhaichi, Mounir",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Arid Regions Institute - IRA,"Ecosystems protected from heavy grazing impacts, such as national parks and refuges, are generally considered to sustain higher plant species diversity and better ecosystem composition and structure compared to heavily grazed areas. To evaluate the impact of livestock grazing, we sampled vegetation characteristics from two areas having different grazing intensity levels. The first site has high protection from grazing and is located inside the Bou Hedma National Park in Southern Tunisia. The second site has a low protection from grazing and is situated within an open area located immediately outside the park boundary where human populations and their livestock have unrestricted access to ecosystem resources. Total plant cover, density, perennial species cover and their contribution were compared between the two grazing level sites. Results show that considerable positive effects occur in the areas protected from grazing. As compared to the overgrazed (open) sites. Several species known for their high palatability, such as Cenchrus ciliaris L., Salvia aegyptiaca L., Echiochilon fruticosum Desf. and Helianthemum sessiliflorum Desf., are more abundant inside the park than outside.

Aboveground biomass and carbon content of five perennial shrubs were studied inside and outside Sidi Toui National Park, southern Tunisia. The effect of long-term protection on aboveground biomass and carbon content was assessed. The main results indicated that both methods provided similar aboveground biomass and carbon values. Aboveground biomass and carbon content were strongly correlated with canopy cover and biovolume (R2 ˃ 0.7). Positive linear relationships were found for all the studied species. Apart from the large canopy cover of Haloxylon schmittianum and Haloxylon scoparium, the obtained results showed that long-term protection had no significant effect on aboveground biomass and carbon content for the other species.

The demand for potable and productive water is ever increasing due to population growth, climate change, increasing numbers of refugees hosted by the country, as well as heightened demand from a growing economy and its different sectors. Household greywater filtration systems (HGWFS) are ideal for repurposing greywater, from wastewater into productive use for small-scale agricultural production. Given that 50 to 80% of residential wastewater is in the form of greywater, there is significant potential for saving fresh potable water and improving household livelihood systems through effective utilization of treated greywater for productive purposes. However, broad uptake of the technology is not forthcoming.  This comparative study examines two technology dissemination pathways and their role in influencing household decisions to adopt, not to adopt, and dis-adopt the HGWFSs.

Lentil is an important staple crop, especially in South Asia and Africa, and has been associated with the prevention of chronic illnesses, including type II diabetes, obesity, and cancer. Lentil, a cool‐season food legume, is rich in protein and micronutrients while also containing a range of prebiotic carbohydrates, such as raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs), fructooligosaccharides, sugar alcohols (SAs), and resistant starch (RS), which contribute to lentil's health benefits. Prebiotic carbohydrates are fermented by beneficial microorganisms in the colon, which impart health benefits to the consumer. Prebiotic carbohydrates are also vital to lentil plant health, being associated with carbon transport/storage and abiotic stress tolerance. Important to both human and plant health, prebiotic carbohydrates in lentil are a prominent candidate for nutrigenomic breeding efforts. New lentil cultivars could help to combat global health problems, while also proving resilient to climate change. The objectives of this review are to: (a) discuss the benefits lentil prebiotic carbohydrates confer to human and plant health; (b) describe the biosynthesis pathways of two prominent prebiotic carbohydrate families in lentil, RFOs and SAs; and (c) consider the potential of prebiotic carbohydrates in terms of future nutritional breeding efforts.",CGIAR System Organization - CGIAR,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.10103,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/11071,,2020-03-22,Plants People Planet,2572-2611,Wiley Open Access,,,,breeding; health; nutrition; lentils; biosynthesis; lentil; genetics and biosynthesis; prebiotic; raffinose family oligosaccharides (rfos); sugar alcohols (sas),

The consequences of mineral/micronutrient deficiencies or the hidden hunger in the developing world are indeed alarming and need urgent attention. In addressing the problems associated with mineral/micronutrient deficiency, grain legumes as an integral component of the farming systems in the developing world have to play a crucial role. For resource-poor populations, a strategy based on selecting and/or developing grain legume cultivars with grains denser in micronutrients, by biofortification, seems the most appropriate and attractive approach to address the problem. This is evident from the on-going global research efforts on biofortification to provide nutrient-dense grains for use by the poorest of the poor in the developing countries. Towards this end, rapidly growing genomics technologies hold promise to hasten the progress of breeding nutritious legume crops. In conjunction with the myriad of expansions in genomics, advances in other 'omics' technologies particularly plant ionomics or ionome profiling open up novel opportunities to comprehensively examine the elemental composition and mineral networks of an organism in a rapid and cost-effective manner. These emerging technologies would effectively guide the scientific community to enrich the edible parts of grain legumes with bio-available minerals and enhancers/promoters.

We applied Weibull theoretical model to compare measured and expected diameter classes’ densities. The tallest and largest individuals were recorded in fields while old fallows had the maximum tree density and regeneration across sites. In over-all, the tree densities across sites as well as regeneration were low in fields and young fallows. We also found that the land management regime significantly influenced regeneration particularly the coppices. On the other hand, the distribution of diameter classes showed that shea agroforests was represented by small diameter classes implying a stable and regenerating population in 92 % of visited sites, irrespective of the land management regime. Thus, the state of regeneration in shea parklands appeals for an improvement in the management of juveniles, a guaranty of future stable population.",,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-015-9787-9,Timeless limited access,Copyrighted; all rights reserved,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/4555,,2015-01-13,Agroforestry Systems,0167-4366,Springer (part of Springer Nature),89,,511-523,fallow; v. paradoxa; shea agroforests; land management regime,BF

Increasing water demand accompanied by a changing climate can lead to unsustainable use of freshwater resulting in water scarcity. Several studies have quantified sustainable water use and water scarcity at a continental-to-global scale in the past. This review focuses on the large-scale water resources assessments and the methods by which sustainable water use and water scarcity are quantified. The review is structured based on a framework that comprises the main components of water demand and supply and other aspects of sustainable water use including virtual water trade and future projections of sustainable water use. The major components of water demand and supply in such assessments are increasingly derived from global earth system models and national-level census datasets. These assessments conclude that the selection of appropriate spatial and temporal scales is critical. The grid-based global earth system models enable better spatial resampling of water information across country/political boundaries. Similarly, by refining the temporal scale from annual (the most commonly used temporal scale of assessment) to monthly time steps, water scarcity is better captured due to the distinctive seasonality of water availability and demand. This paper also discusses the role of major drivers of water scarcity. Although both changing climate and increasing water demand contribute to water scarcity, the majority of the literature concludes that the demand-driven freshwater scarcity has a much greater impact than that induced by climate change.",International Water Management Institute - IWMI,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40899-020-00379-7,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/12030,,2020-02-11,Sustainable Water Resources Management,2363-5037,Springer Nature,6,,,water scarcity; water demand; water footprint; water withdrawal; environmental flow; water consumption; sustainable water use,
"Crops that feed the world 11. Pearl Millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.): an important source of food security, nutrition and health in the arid and semi-arid tropics","Jukanti, A. K .; Gowda, CL Laxmipathi; Rai, K.N.; Manga, Vinod Kumar; Bhatt, R.K.",Central Arid Zone Research Institute  - CAZRI; Global Research-for-development Support Ventures - GRSV; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics - ICRISAT,"Pearl millet is a major cereal in the arid and semiarid
regions of Asia and Africa. It is primarily cultivated for
grain production, but its stover is also valued as dry fodder.
Pearl millet is resilient to climate change due to its inherent
adaptability to drought and high temperatures. It is also tolerant
of saline and acid soils, and is well adapted to marginal
lands with low productivity. Pearl millet germplasm exhibits
large genetic variability for yield components; and various
agronomic, adaptation and nutritional traits. Open pollinated
varieties and hybrids are two important cultivar options, but
higher productivity is realized through hybrids. Pearl millet
has fewer pest and disease problems compared to other cereals
and is suited to different cropping systems. It is highly responsive
to improved crop management practices, as witnessed in
parts of India where it is grown as an irrigated summer crop
that produces higher yields and better quality grain. Pearl millet
has high nutritional value in terms of high levels of energy,
dietary fibre, proteins with a balanced amino acid profile,
many essential minerals, some vitamins, and antioxidants.
These play a significant role in prevention of important human
ailments such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative
diseases. There is great potential for harnessing
these positive attributes through genetic improvement, improved
crop management, and grain processing and food products technologies. These should help to develop greater
global awareness of the importance of this crop for food and
nutritional security",,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-016-0557-y,Limited access,CC-BY-NC-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/6523,,2016-03-08,Food Security,1876-4517,Springer Verlag (Germany),8,2,307-329,health; nutrition; crop management; pearl millet; adaptations; production constraints,IN
"EFFECT OF RAINFALL INTENSITY, SLOPE, LAND USE AND ANTECEDENT SOIL MOISTURE ON SOIL EROSION IN AN ARID ENVIRONMENT","Ziadat, Feras M.; Taimeh, Awni",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; University of Jordan - JU,"Most climate change scenarios predict a significant increase in the frequency of high intensity rainfall events especially in the dry areas, which will increase runoff and soil erosion. Understanding the factors that control soil erosion is crucial to recommending appropriate measures to protect soils and reduce their vulnerability. The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of rainfall intensity, slope, land use and antecedent soil moisture on soil erosion and runoff. Twelve sites from Al-Muwaqqar watershed, Jordan, were selected to represent six slope angles: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9%. Two sites, one cultivated with barley and one as rangeland, were selected within each slope. Erosion was measured under three rainfall intensities: 3, 5 and 10 mm h−1; and three different antecedent soil moisture contents: dry, wet and very wet; using a rotating disk rainfall simulator. Regression equations indicated that rainfall intensity was the most important factor affecting soil erosion and that erosion could occur at a relatively small intensity on wet soils as a result of subsequent rainfall events. Soil erosion on cultivated land was primarily affected by moisture content, while on uncultivated land, it was mostly affected by slope steepness. Rainfall intensity, slope and antecedent moisture explained 84–89 and 59–66% of the variation in runoff and soil loss, respectively. The results indicated the significant influence of cultivating the land on soil erosion.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.2239,Limited access,CC-BY-NC-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/7278,,2013-12-29,Land Degradation and Development,1085-3278,Wiley: 12 months,24,6,582-590,jordan; rainfall simulator; sediment concentration; soil erodibility; surface crust; runoff strips,JO
Genome-wide association mapping of lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) prebiotic carbohydrates toward improved human health and crop stress tolerance,"Johnson, Nathan; Boatwright, J. Lucas; Bridges, William; Thavarajah, Pushparajah; Agrawal, Shiv Kumar; Shipe, Emerson; Thavarajah, Dil",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Clemson University,"Lentil, a cool-season food legume, is rich in protein and micronutrients with a range of prebiotic carbohydrates, such as raffinose-family oligosaccharides (RFOs), fructooligosaccharides (FOSs), sugar alcohols (SAs), and resistant starch (RS), which contribute to lentil's health benefits. Beneficial microorganisms ferment prebiotic carbohydrates in the colon, which impart health benefits to the consumer. In addition, these carbohydrates are vital to lentil plant health associated with carbon transport, storage, and abiotic stress tolerance. Thus, lentil prebiotic carbohydrates are a potential nutritional breeding target for increasing crop resilience to climate change with increased global nutritional security. This study phenotyped a total of 143 accessions for prebiotic carbohydrates. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was then performed to identify associated variants and neighboring candidate genes. All carbohydrates analyzed had broad-sense heritability estimates (H2) ranging from 0.22 to 0.44, comparable to those reported in the literature. Concentration ranges corresponded to percent recommended daily allowances of 2–9% SAs, 7–31% RFOs, 51–111% RS, and 57–116% total prebiotic carbohydrates. Significant SNPs and associated genes were identified for numerous traits, including a galactosyltransferase (Lcu.2RBY.1g019390) known to aid in RFO synthesis. Further studies in multiple field locations are necessary.

There are hundreds of technical options for improving the sustainability of land management and preventing or reversing degradation, but there are many sociocultural, institutional, economic, and policy barriers hindering their adoption at large scale. To tackle this challenge, the Dryland Systems Program of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification convened an expert group to consider barriers and incentives to scaling technologies, processes, policies, or institutional arrangements. The group reviewed existing frameworks for scaling sustainable land management (SLM) interventions across a range of contexts and identified eight critical actions for success: (a) plan iteratively; (b) consistently fund; (c) select SLM options for scaling based on best available evidence; (d) identify and engage with stakeholders at all scales; (e) build capacity for scaling; (f) foster institutional leadership and policy change to support scaling; (g) achieve early benefits and incentives for as many stakeholders as possible; and (h) monitor, evaluate, and communicate. Incentives for scaling were identified for the private sector, farmers and their communities, and policy makers. Based on these findings, a new action framework for scaling is presented that analyses the contexts where specific SLM interventions can be scaled, so that SLM options can be screened and adapted to these contexts, piloted and disseminated.

gene-based markers for various adaptive and quality traits. Mean diversity index (DI) estimates
revealed synthetic hexaploids to be genetically more diverse (DI= 0.284) than elites
(DI = 0.267) and landraces (DI = 0.245). GBS markers discovered thousands of new SNP
variations in the landraces which were well known to be adapted to drought (1273 novel

In
such areas, heat stress is one of the most important production challenges for wheat. The
expected rising global temperature of 1-4°C over the next 50 years will have an effect on the
production of wheat in the tropics through heat stress (Hansen, 2006). Heat stress affects
more than 30 million hectares of wheat annually in the world and leading to significant grain
yield reduction (Battisti and Naylor, 2010). High temperature is reported to decrease yields by
3 to 5 per cent per every 1°C increase above 15°C in plants under controlled conditions
(Gibson and Paulsen, 1999). In addition, the effect of climate change is also evident on the
quality of wheat, as increased heat results in shriveled wheat grains (Tadesse et al., 2013). To
adapt new crop varieties to the future climate, we need to understand how crops respond to
elevated temperatures and how tolerance to heat can be improved (Halford, 2009). Success in
crop improvement generally depends on the magnitude of genetic variability and the extent
to which the desirable characters are important. Germplasm evaluation will be of great

An Integrated Framework for Assessment of Hybrid Water Supply Systems,"Sapkota, Mukta; Arora, Meenakshi; Malano, Hector; Moglia, Magnus; Sharma, Ashok; George, Biju Alummoottil; Pamminger, Francis","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organisation - CSIRO; The University of Melbourne, Department of Infrastructure Engineering; Yarra Valley Water; Victoria University, Institute of Sustainability and Innovation","Urban water managers around the world are adopting decentralized water supply
systems, often in combination with centralized systems. While increasing demand for water
arising from population growth is one of the primary reasons for this increased adoption of
alternative technologies, factors such as climate change, increased frequency of extreme weather
events and rapid urbanization also contribute to an increased rate of adoption of these technologies.
This combination of centralized-decentralized water systems approach is referred to as “hybrid
water supply systems” and is based on the premise that the provision of alternative water sources
at local scales can both extend the capacity of existing centralized water supply infrastructures,
and improve resilience to variable climatic conditions. It is important to understand, however,
that decentralized water production and reuse may change the flow and composition of wastewater
and stormwater, thereby potentially also having negative impacts on its effectiveness and
performance. This paper describes a framework to assess the interactions between decentralized
water supply systems and existing centralized water servicing approaches using several analytical
tools, including water balance modelling, contaminant balance modelling and multi-criteria
decision analysis. The framework enables the evaluation of impacts due to change in quantity
and quality of wastewater and stormwater on the existing centralized system arising from the
implementation of hybrid water supply systems. The framework consists of two parts: (1) Physical
system analysis for various potential scenarios and (2) Ranking of Scenarios. This paper includes the
demonstration of the first part of the framework for an area of Melbourne, Australia by comparing

Assessing the impacts of livestock production on biodiversity in rangeland ecosystems,"Alkemade, Rob; Reid, Robin; van den Berg, Maurits; de Leeuw, Jan; Jeuken, Michel","PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency; Colorado State University, Center for Collaborative Conservation - COLOSTATE - Collaborate Conservation; World Agroforestry Center - ICRAF","Biodiversity in rangelands is decreasing, due to intense utilization
for livestock production and conversion of rangeland into cropland;
yet the outlook of rangeland biodiversity has not been
considered in view of future global demand for food. Here we
assess the impact of future livestock production on the global
rangelands area and their biodiversity. First we formalized existing
knowledge about livestock grazing impacts on biodiversity,
expressed in mean species abundance (MSA) of the original
rangeland native species assemblages, through metaanalysis of
peer-reviewed literature. MSA values, ranging from 1 in natural
rangelands to 0.3 in man-made grasslands, were entered in the
IMAGE-GLOBIO model. This model was used to assess the impact
of change in food demand and livestock production on future
rangeland biodiversity. The model revealed remarkable regional
variation in impact on rangeland area and MSA between two
agricultural production scenarios. The area of used rangelands
slightly increases globally between 2000 and 2050 in the baseline
scenario and reduces under a scenario of enhanced uptake of
resource-efficient production technologies increasing production
[high levels of agricultural knowledge, science, and technology
(high-AKST)], particularly in Africa. Both scenarios suggest a global
decrease in MSA for rangelands until 2050. The contribution of
livestock grazing to MSA loss is, however, expected to diminish
after 2030, in particular in Africa under the high-AKST scenario.

What plant breeding may (and may not) look like in 2050?,"Bassi, Filippo; Sanchez-Garcia, Miguel; Ortiz, Rodomiro",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences - SLU,"At the turn of 2000 many authors envisioned future plant breeding. Twenty years
after, which of those authors’ visions became reality or not, and which ones may
become so in the years to come. After two decades of debates, climate change is
a “certainty,” food systems shifted from maximizing farm production to reducing environmental impact, and hopes placed into GMOs are mitigated by their low appre ciation by consumers. We revise herein how plant breeding may raise or reduce genetic gains based on the breeder’s equation. “Accuracy of Selection” has signif icantly improved by many experimental-scale field and laboratory implements, but also by vulgarizing statistical models, and integrating DNA markers into selection. Pre-breeding has really promoted the increase of useful “Genetic Variance.” Short ening “Recycling Time” has seen great progression, to the point that achieving a denominator equal to “1” is becoming a possibility. Maintaining high “Selection Intensity” remains the biggest challenge, since adding any technology results in a higher cost per progeny, despite the steady reduction in cost per datapoint. Further more, the concepts of variety and seed enterprise might change with the advent of cheaper genomic tools to monitor their use and the promotion of participatory or cit izen science. The technological and societal changes influence the new generation of plant breeders, moving them further away from field work, emphasizing instead the use of genomic-based selection methods relying on big data.

A possible alternative to minimize the effects of climate change is to introduce species with better tolerance to salt and drought stresses. One of the options is quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.), which was grown in field trials in several Mediterranean countries, to study the effects of drought and salinity on yield and other characters. Drought stress during the vegetative growth stage leads to deep root development, and without stress conditions for the rest of the growing season allowed the plant to be able to optimize its photosynthesis and carbon translocation. Stress during seed filling recorded the lowest yields. The influence of organic matter on yield was more important under deficit irrigation than under full irrigation. The interaction between relative water content and leaf water potential indicated that regulating cellular water deficit and volume is a powerful mechanism for conserving cellular hydration under drought. In all climatic conditions, drought and use of irrigation water with salinity up to 30 dS m−1 caused slightly reduced yield as compared to full irrigation with fresh water. Highest values of water conductivity resulted in higher seed weight, and as a consequence, an increase in fibre and total saponin content, and a small decrease in free phenolic compounds in quinoa seeds.

"Performances, Policies, Challenges and Opportunities of the Tunisian Agriculture Sector from Natural Resources Management Perspective a SWOT Analysis","Dhehibi, Boubaker; Frija, Aymen; Aw-Hassan, Aden A.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,"A comprehensive assessment of the Tunisian agricultural potential, production, natural resources
management and policies has been presented using SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats)
analysis. Concerning the strengths of the agricultural sector in Tunisia, it is important to notice that the
sustained growth of this sector over the last three decades can be considered as an important factor of
agricultural development in the short and medium run. Moreover, the social role of the agricultural sector in
rural development and income generation for the poorest population made it necessary to consider this sector
from a social perspective in addition to the efficient economic perspective. Among the weaknesses, the paper
indicates that they are related to the environmental degradation (land and water). In addition, the intensification
rate in some irrigated areas is still below the targeted potentials. Local water users associations, even though
spread all over the country and taking into change the management of most of the irrigated areas in Tunisia,
are still facing a lot of social, financial and organizational difficulties. Despite these challenges, some
opportunities seem to be in favor of the Tunisian agricultural sector. The policy makers in Tunisia are willing
to modernize the sector with new educated and open minded farmer’s generation in Tunisia with their
willingness to adopt new technologies once efficiently targeted by the necessary extension services. Major
remaining threats of the Tunisian agriculture are relative to the low consciousness level of private farmers about
sustainability issues, climate change impact on rain fed agriculture and on the availability and use of water
resources, fluctuation of the international food market prices and the increase of the energy prices. Moreover,
the current weak political context after the 2011 revolution made it difficult to implement and to enforce various

To identify heat-tolerant germplasm, three different germplasm panels (“discovery,” “investigation,” and “validation”) were studied under a range of heat-stressed conditions. Grain yield (GY) and its components were recorded at each site and a heat stress susceptibility index was calculated, confirming that each 1°C temperature rise corresponds to a GY reduction in durum wheat of 4.6%–6.3%. A total of 2552 polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) defined the diversity of the first panel, while 5642 SNPs were polymorphic in the “investigation panel.” The use of genome-wide association studies revealed that 36 quantitative trait loci were associated with the target traits in the discovery panel, of which five were confirmed in a “subset” tested imposing heat stress by plastic tunnels, and in the investigation panel. A study of allelic combinations confirmed that Q.icd.Heat.003-1A, Q.icd.Heat.007-1B, and Q.icd.Heat.016-3B are additive in nature and the positive alleles at all three loci resulted in a 16% higher GY under heat stress. The underlying SNPs were converted into kompetitive allele specific PCR markers and tested on the validation panel, confirming that each explained up to 9% of the phenotypic variation for GY under heat stress.

This work has primarily been carried out in commercial breeds for which the dominant selection pressures are associated with artificial selection. As agriculture and food security are likely to be strongly affected by climate change, a better understanding of environment-imposed selection on agricultural species is warranted. Ethiopia is an ideal setting to investigate environmental adaptation in livestock due to its wide variation in geo-climatic characteristics and the extensive genetic and phenotypic variation of its livestock. Here, we identified over three million single nucleotide variants across 12 Ethiopian sheep populations and applied landscape genomics approaches to investigate the association between these variants and environmental variables. Our results suggest that environmental adaptation for precipitation-related variables is stronger than that related to altitude or temperature, consistent with large-scale meta-analyses of selection pressure across species. The set of genes showing association with environmental variables was enriched for genes highly expressed in human blood and nerve tissues. There was also evidence of enrichment for genes associated with high-altitude adaptation although no strong association was identified with hypoxia-inducible-factor (HIF) genes. One of the strongest altitude-related signals was for a collagen gene, consistent with previous studies of high-altitude adaptation. Several altitude-associated genes also showed evidence of adaptation with temperature, suggesting a relationship between responses to these environmental factors.

Using Ghana as a case study, a method for evaluating areas that are both suitable andavailable for oil palm production is presented. Our assessment used spatial data and GIS techniques, andshowed that areas with suitable climatic conditions (annual average water deficit <400 mm) is about 20%greater than was previously identified. The observed differences are the result of using different meth-ods to determine suitability, and climate change. A major climatic factor limiting suitability for oil palmproduction in Ghana is the annual water deficit, with the most suitable areas located in the rainforest andsemi-deciduous forest zones with higher rainfall in southern Ghana. Opportunities for large-scale oil palmplantation development is limited, however, because of the lack of availability of large and contiguoustracts of land that are required for commercial plantation oil palm development. A feasible strategy foroil palm expansion is therefore smallholder production, which can make use of smaller parcels of land.Alternatively, oil palm production in Ghana can be increased by yield intensification on land alreadyplanted to oil palm. This can also reduce the requirement for further land clearance for new plantationsto meet the growing demand for palm oil.

Ecogeographic survey and gap analysis of Lathyrus L. species,"Shehadeh, Ali; Amri, Ahmed; Maxted, Nigel",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Birmingham City University - BCU,"The genetic diversity of the genus Lathyrus
is of significant importance, particularly for its role
in sustaining the livelihoods of local communities

to adapt to climate change. Grasspea (L. sativus) is
the most widely used species and to a lesser extent
L. cicera and L. ochrus, each is used for animal feed in
many parts of the world and food in poorer regions, but
human over-consumption of the seeds can lead to
lathyrism, a disease caused by neurotoxins. This study
has added substantial information and accuracy to the

A Participatory GIS Approach to Identify Critical Land Degradation Areas and Prioritize Soil Conservation for Mountainous Olive Groves (Case Study),"Al-Wadaey, Ahmed; Ziadat, Feras M.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Sanaa University - Sanaa,"Climate change scenarios predict an
increase in the frequency of heavy rainfall events in
some areas. This will increase runoff and soil erosion,
and reduce agricultural productivity, particularly on
vulnerable mountainous agricultural lands that is
already exhibiting high rates of soil erosion.
Haphazard implementation of soil and water
conservation (SWC) interventions on scattered fields
is inefficient in reducing soil erosion. The objective of
this study was to identify areas at high risk of erosion
to aid the design and implementation of sustainable
SWC using GIS analysis and farmers’ participation
approach. A 25 m digital elevation model (DEM) was
used to derive layers of flow accumulation, slope
steepness and land curvature, which were used to
derive an erosion-risk (priority) map for the whole
watershed. Boundaries of farmers’ fields were
mapped and verified by the community and each field
was classified into high, moderate or low erosion risk.
Fields with low flow accumulation (top of hill) and/or
steep slope and/or convex slope were assigned high
erosion risk and therefore high implementation
priority. The study showed that more than 64% of the
fields were classified into high erosion risk areas.
Accordingly, a community-watershed plan was
established, revised and approved by the community Incentive loans to implement SWC measures were
distributed to 100 farmers based on the priorities of
their fields. Judged by local farmers and using 16
randomly selected fields, 90% of the targeted areas
were correctly identified using the erosion risk map.
After two years, the conservation measures had led to
marked improvement of soil conservation. The
approach is simple and easy to comprehend by the
community and provides scientific basis to prioritize
the implementation of SWC and to target the most
degraded areas, which amplify the impact of these in
reducing the vulnerability to land degradation.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-013-2827-x,Limited access,CC-BY-NC-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/7300,,2014-05-28,Journal of Mountain Science,1672-6316,Springer Verlag (Germany),11,3,782-791,soil erosion; olive; community-conservation plan; priority map; flow accumulation,SY
Tillage system and genotype effects on early vigor and water use in bread wheat in the Mediterranean region,"Karrou, Mohammed",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,"The southern part of the Mediterranean basin is among the regions that are characterized by recurrent
droughts and it is threatened by the effects of climate change. To deal with these problems in wheat,
improved techniques of rain water conservation and adapted varieties need to be developed.
Combining zero tillage and varieties with early vigor can reduce evaporation and improve transpiration
and water productivity and hence increase yields. To test this hypothesis, a field trial was conducted at
ICARDA’s research station at Tel Hadya, Aleppo, Syria in 2008/2009 and 2011/2012. The treatments
tested were “zero tillage vs. conventional tillage” and five genotypes of bread wheat. In 2008/2009,
results showed that zero tillage improved leaf area index, specific leaf area, above ground biomass
production and actual evapotranspiration at the beginning of stem elongation. The values increased,
respectively for these parameters, from 2.34 to 3.25, 202.9 to 226.5 cm2 g-1, 1799 to 2333 kg ha-1 and
from 91 to 101 mm. Water productivity was improved by 15%, on average. In year 2011/2012, the effect
of tillage system on all the parameters was not statistically significant. In general, all genotypes
responded positively to zero tillage for these measured variables. From this study, we can conclude
that zero tillage under dry conditions is a technique that can improve the early vigor of the seedlings.
This enhanced early growth can ensure a good canopy cover that reduces the loss of rainwater by
evaporation and increases transpiration in relatively early dry years. The non disturbance of soil by
tillage reduces water loss by evaporation. However, under wet conditions due to high rainfall, the
positive effect of zero tillage on soil moisture and plant growth disappears.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,,Open access,CC-BY-NC-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/7252,,2013-10-22,African Journal of Agricultural Research,1991-637X,Academic Journals,8,41,5069-5075,wheat; zero tillage; biomass; evapotranspiration; leaf area; genotype,SY
Unlocking the story of resistance to Zymoseptoria tritici in Tunisian old durum wheat germplasm based on population structure analysis,"Ouaja, Maroua; Bahri, Bochra; Ferjaoui, Sahbi; Medini, Maher; Udupa, Sripada M.; Hamza, Sonia",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; National Agricultural Research Institute of Tunisia - INRAT; National Agronomic Institute of Tunisia - INAT; University of Georgia - UGA; Regional Field Crop Research Center of Beja - CRRGC; Banque Nationale des Gènes - BNG,"Background
Septoria tritici blotch (STB) remains a significant obstacle to durum wheat cultivation on a global scale. This disease remains a challenge for farmers, researchers, and breeders, who are collectively dedicated to reduce its damage and improve wheat resistance. Tunisian durum wheat landraces have been recognized as valuable genetic ressources that exhibit resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and therefore play a crucial role in breeding program aimed at creating new wheat varieties resistant to fungal diseases as STB, as well as adapted to climate change constraints.

Results
A total of 366 local durum wheat accessions were assessed for resistance to two virulent Tunisian isolates of Zymoseptoria tritici Tun06 and TM220 under field conditions. Population structure analysis of the durum wheat accessions, performed with 286 polymorphic SNPs (PIC > 0.3) covering the entire genome, identified three genetic subpopulations (GS1, GS2 and GS3) with 22% of admixed genotypes. Interestingly, all of the resistant genotypes were among GS2 or admixed with GS2.

Conclusions
This study revealed the population structure and the genetic distribution of the resistance to Z. tritici in the Tunisian durum wheat landraces. Accessions grouping pattern reflected the geographical origins of the landraces. We suggested that GS2 accessions were mostly derived from eastern Mediterranean populations, unlike GS1 and GS3 that originated from the west. Resistant GS2 accessions belonged to landraces Taganrog, Sbei glabre, Richi, Mekki, Badri, Jneh Khotifa and Azizi. Furthermore, we suggested that admixture contributed to transmit STB resistance from GS2 resistant landraces to initially susceptible landraces such as Mahmoudi (GS1), but also resulted in the loss of resistance in the case of GS2 susceptible Azizi and Jneh Khotifa accessions.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-023-09395-1,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/69624,,2023-06-15,BMC Genomics,1471-2164,BioMed Central,24,,,durum wheat; genetic structure; zymoseptoria tritici; resistance; admixture; durum wheat landraces,TN
Selective organic carbon losses from soils by sheet erosion and main controls,"Müller-Nedebock, Daniel; Chivenge, Pauline; Chaplot, Vincent",University of KwaZulu-Natal - UKZN; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics - ICRISAT; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement - IRD,"Although the impact of sheet erosion on the selective transportation of mineral soil particles has beenwidely investigated,
little is yet known about the specific mechanisms of organic carbon (OC) erosion, which constitutes an important link in the global
carbon cycle. The present study was conducted to quantify the impact of sheet erosion on OC losses from soils. Erosion plots with
the lengths of 1- and 5-m were installed at different topographic positions along a hillslope in a mountainous South African region.
A total of 32 rainfall events from a three years period (November 2010 up to February 2013), were studied and evaluated for runoff
(R), particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POCL and DOCL). In comparison to the 0–0·05m bulk soil, the sediments from the
1-m plots were enriched in OC by a factor 2·6 and those from the 5-m long plots by a factor of 2·2, respectively. These findings suggest
a preferential erosion of OC. In addition, total organic carbon losses (TOCL) were incurred mainly in particulate form (~94%) and the
increase in TOCL from 14·09 ± 0·68 g C m 1 yr 1 on 1-m plots to 50·03 ± 2·89 g C m 1 yr 1 on 5-m plots illustrated an increase in
sheet erosion efficiency with increasing slope length. Both TOCL and sediment enrichment in OC correspondingly increased with a
decrease in soil basal grass cover. The characteristics of rainstorms had no significant impact on the selectivity of OC erosion. The
results accrued in this study investigating the links between sheet erosion and OC losses, are expected to be of future value in the
generation of carbon specific erosion models, which can further help to inform and improve climate change mitigation measures.

Effect of High Temperature Stress During the Reproductive Stage on Grain Yield and Nutritional Quality of Lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus),"Choukri, Hasnae; El Haddad, Noureddine; Aloui, Khawla; Hejjaoui, Kamal; El-Baouchi, Adil; Smouni, Abdelaziz; Thavarajah, Dil; Maalouf, Fouad; Agrawal, Shiv Kumar","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Clemson University; Mohammed VI Polytechnic University - UM6P; Mohammed V University, Faculty of Science - UM5 - FSR; Hassan II University, Faculty of Sciences Ben M'sik - UH2C- FSBM","High temperature during the reproductive stage limits the growth and development of lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus). The reproductive and seed filling periods are the most sensitive to heat stress, resulting in limited yield and nutritional quality. Climate change causes frequent incidents of heat stress for global food crop production. This study aimed to assess the impact of high temperature during the reproductive stage of lentil on grain yield, nutritional value, and cooking quality. Thirty-six lentil genotypes were evaluated under controlled conditions for their high temperature response. Genotypic variation was significant (p < 0.001) for all the traits under study. High temperature-induced conditions reduced protein, iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in lentils. Under heat stress conditions, mineral concentrations among lentil genotypes varied from 6.0 to 8.8 mg/100 g for Fe and from 4.9 to 6.6 mg/100 g for Zn. Protein ranged from 21.9 to 24.3 g/100 g. Cooking time was significantly reduced due to high temperature treatment; the range was 3–11 min, while under no stress conditions, cooking time variation was from 5 to 14 min. Phytic acid variation was 0.5–1.2 g/100 g under no stress conditions, while under heat stress conditions, phytic acid ranged from 0.4 to 1.4 g/100 g.

ICARDA Efforts to Promote In Situ/On-farm Conservation of Dryland Agrobiodiversity,"Amri, Ahmed; Yazbek, Mariana; Shehadeh, Ali; Nawar, Mohamed Fawzy Faraq; Tsivelikas, Athanasios; Biradar, Chandrashekhar",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,"Dryland biodiversity has only recently got due attention because of its potential to contribute in overcoming the effects of global challenges caused by land degradation and and climate change (FAO, 1989). More particularly, the non-tropical dryland agrobiodiversity is of special significance since it encompasses the four major Vavilovian centers of diversity (Mediterranean, West Asia, Central Asia and Abyssinian) where most of the world today’s major food and feed species have evolved. The Fertile Crescent (including Jordan, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, southeast Turkey and southern Iran) is considered an area of megadiversity where wheat, barley, lentil, pea, vetch, alfalfa and others
have their centers of origin, diversity and domestication and where their landraces and wild relatives are still prevailing within traditional farming systems (Harlan, 1975). This agrobiodiversity, in addition to its role in sustaining the livelihoods of poor communities living under harsh conditions, are a rich reservoir for supplying genetic resources to ensure continuous genetic gains in breeding programmes and for use in the rehabilitation/ restoration of degraded farming and eco-systems or their diversification. Despite limited information available, all indications show that this agrobiodiversity is subject to a rapid and alarming loss calling for more concerted efforts at local, national, regional and global levels for its conservation and sustainable use. The ex situ conservation in genebanks should be complemented with in situ/farm management of agrobiodiversity to ensure dynamic conservation of larger diversity including that of
recalcitrant species and their associated local knowledge Jarvis et al., 2001.
ICARDA through its coordination of the Global Environment Facility (GEF)-funded project on “conservation and sustainable use of dryland agrobiodiversity in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine and Syria” implemented during 1999-2005 has developed a holistic community based in situ conservation approach which is adopted in several initiatives promoting on-farm conservation of landraces in many countries (Amri et al., 2005).",CGIAR System Organization - CGIAR,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0976-1926.2016.00042.5,Open access,Copyrighted; Non-commercial educational use only,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/5892,,2016-12-14,Indian Journal of Plant Genetic Resources,0971-8184,Indian Society of Plant Genetic Resources,29,3,265-267,biodiversity; drylands; income; seed,DZ; EG; ET; IQ; JO; MA; SY; TN
Contribution of Wild Relatives to Durum Wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum) Yield Stability across Contrasted Environments,"Aberkane, Hafid; Amri, Ahmed; Belkadi, Bouchra; Filali-Maltouf, Abdelkarim; Valkoun, Jan; Kehel, Zakaria","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Mohammed V University, Faculty of Science - UM5 - FSR","Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum) is mostly grown in Mediterranean type environments, characterized by unpredictable rainfall amounts and distribution, heat stress, and prevalence of major diseases and pests, all to be exacerbated with climate change. Pre-breeding efforts transgressing adaptive genes from wild relatives need to be strengthened to overcome these abiotic and biotic challenges. In this study, we evaluated the yield stability of 67 lines issued from interspecific crosses of Cham5 and Haurani with Triticum dicoccoides, T. agilopoides, T. urartu, and Aegilops speltoides, grown under 15 contrasting rainfed and irrigated environments in Morocco, and heat-prone conditions in Sudan. Yield stability was assessed using parametric (univariate (e.g., Bi, S2di, Pi etc) and multivariate (ASV, SIPC)) and non-parametric (Si1, Si2, Si3 and Si6) approaches. The combined analysis of variance showed the highly significant effects of genotypes, environments, and genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI). The environments varied in yield (1370–6468 kg/ha), heritability (0.08–0.9), and in their contribution to the GEI. Several lines derived from the four wild parents combined productivity and stability, making them suitable for unpredictable climatic conditions. A significant advantage in yield and stability was observed in Haurani derivatives compared to their recurrent parent. Furthermore, no yield penalty was observed in many of Cham5 derivatives; they had improved yield under unfavorable environments while maintaining the high yield potential from the recurrent parent (e.g., 142,026 and 142,074). It was found that a limited number of backcrosses can produce high yielding/stable germplasm while increasing diversity in a breeding pipeline. Comparing different stability approaches showed that some of them can be used interchangeably; others can be complementary to combine broad adaption with higher yield.",Global Crop Diversity Trust - GCDT,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11101992,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/67361,,2021-10-01,Agronomy,2073-4395,MDPI,11,10,,crop wild relatives; yield stability; durum wheat; genotype by environment interaction,MA

Here, 19 durum wheat, 24 barley, and 24 lentil elites incorporating CWR in their pedigrees were yield
tested against commercial checks across 19 environments located in Morocco, Ethiopia, Lebanon, and
Senegal. For each crop, the combined analysis of variance showed that genotype (G), environment

matrix revealed that grain yield was mostly influenced by the maximum daily temperature and soil
moisture level during the growing stages. These climatic factors were used to define five clusters
(i.e., E1 to E5) of mega-environments. The CWR-derived elites significantly outperformed the checks
in E1, E2, and E4 for durum wheat, and in E2 for both barley and lentil. The germplasm was also
assessed for several food transformation characteristics. For durum wheat, one accession (Zeina)

three accessions originating from T. araraticum and T. urartu were superior for Zn concentration. For
barley, 21 accessions originating from H. spontaneum were superior to the checks for protein content,
six for Zn content, and eight for  -glucan. For lentil, ten accessions originating from Lens orientalis

Comprehensive knowledge of the genetic biodiversity of cultivated and wild sorghum germplasm is an important prerequisite for sustainability of sorghum production. Recurrent droughts resulting from climate change scenarios’ in many East and Central Africa countries, where sorghum is a significant arable crop, can potentially lead to genetic erosion and loss of valuable genetic resources. This study aimed at assessing the extent and pattern of genetic diversity and population genetic structure among sorghum accessions from selected countries in East and Central Africa (Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Rwanda and Burundi) using39 microsatellites markers. The studied loci were polymorphic and revealed a total of 941 alleles in 1108 sorghum genotypes. High levels of diversity were revealed with Sudan (68.5) having the highest level of genetic diversity followed by Ethiopia (65.3), whereas Burundi (0.45) and Rwanda (0.33) had the lowest level of genetic diversity. Analysis of molecular variance indicated, all variance components to be highly significant (p<0.001). The bulk of the variation was partitioned within countries (68.1%) compared to among countries (31.9%). Genetic differentiation between countries based on FST values was high and highly significant (FST=0.32). Neighbour-joining (NJ) analysis formed two distinct clusters according to geographic regions, namely the central region (Kenya, Burundi, Uganda and Rwanda) and the eastern region (Sudan, Ethiopia, and Eritrea). Population structure analysis revealed six distinct populations corresponding to NJ analysis and geographical origin of accessions. Countries clustered independently with small integration, which indicated the role of farmers’ practices in the maintenance of landrace identity and genetic diversity. The observed high level of genetic diversity indicated that germplasm from East Africa should be preserved from genetic erosion, especially in countries with the highest diversity.",,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.33865/wjb.001.03.0010,Open access,CC-BY-NC-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/6568,,2016-03-31,World Journal of Biology and Biotechnology,2518-0878,Scientific Press (SMC-Private) Limited,1,3,113-120,genetic structure; genetic erosion and simple sequence repeat,BI; ER; ET; KE; RW; UG; SD
Field-scale modeling of tree–crop interactions: Challenges and development needs,"Bayala, Jules",World Agroforestry Center - ICRAF,"Agroforestry has attracted considerable attention in recent years because of its potential to reduce poverty, improve
food security, reduce land degradation and mitigate climate change. However, progress in promoting agroforestry
is held back because decision-makers lack reliable tools to accurately predict yields from tree-crop
mixtures. Amongst the key challenges faced in developing such tools are the complexity of agroforestry, including
interactions between various system components, and the large spatial domains and timescales over which
trees and crops interact. A model that is flexible enough to simulate any agroforestry system globally should be
able to address competition and complementarity above and below ground between trees and crops for light,
water and nutrients. Most agroforestry practices produce multiple products including food, fiber and fuel, as
well as income, shade and other ecosystem services, all of which need to be simulated for a comprehensive understanding
of the overall system to emerge.
Several agroforestry models and model families have been developed, including SCUAF, HyPAR, Hi-SAFE/YieldSAFE
and WaNuLCAS, but as of 2015 their use has remained limited for reasons including insufficient flexibility,
restricted ability to simulate interactions, extensive parameterization needs or lack of model maintenance. An ef-
ficient approach to improving the flexibility and durability of agroforestry models is to integrate them into a wellestablished
modular crop modeling framework like APSIM. This framework currently focuses on field-scale crops
and pastures, but has the capability to reuse or interoperate with existing models including tree, livestock and
landscape models, it uses parameters that are intuitive and relatively easy to measure, and it allows scenario analysis
that can include farm-scale economics. Various types of agroforestry systems are currently being promoted
in many contexts, and the impacts of these innovations are often unclear. Rapid progress in reliable modeling of
tree and crop performance for such systems is needed to ensure that agroforestry fulfills its potential to contribute
to reducing poverty, improving food security and fostering sustainability.",,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-015-9787-9,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/4556,,2015-12-31,Agroforest Syst,,Elsevier,,,,agroforestry,BF

High temperatures affect plants at various organizational levels, primarily accelerating phenology to limit biomass production and shortening reproductive phase to curtail flower and fruit numbers, thus resulting in severe yield losses. Besides, heat stress also disrupts normal growth, development, cellular metabolism, and gene expression, which alters shoot and root structures, branching patterns, leaf surface and orientation, and anatomical, structural, and functional aspects of leaves and flowers. The reproductive growth stage is crucial in plants’ life cycle, and susceptible to high temperatures, as reproductive processes are negatively impacted thus reducing crop yield. Genetic variation exists among genotypes of various crops to resist impacts of heat stress. Several screening studies have successfully phenotyped large populations of various crops to distinguish heat-tolerant and heat-sensitive genotypes using various traits, related to shoots (including leaves), flowers, fruits (pods, spikes, spikelets), and seeds (or grains), which have led to direct release of heat-tolerant cultivars in some cases (such as chickpea). In the present review, we discuss examples of contrasting genotypes for heat tolerance in different crops, involving many traits related to thermotolerance in leaves (membrane thermostability, photosynthetic efficiency, chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence, stomatal activity), flowers (pollen viability, pollen germination, fertilization, ovule viability), roots (architecture), biomolecules (antioxidants, osmolytes, phytohormones, heat-shock proteins, other stress proteins), and “omics” (phenomics, transcriptomics, genomics) approaches. The traits linked to heat tolerance can be introgressed into high yielding but heat-sensitive genotypes of crops to enhance their thermotolerance. Involving these traits will be useful for screening contrasting genotypes and would pave the way for characterizing the underlying molecular mechanisms, which could be valuable for engineering plants with enhanced thermotolerance. Wherever possible, we discussed breeding and biotechnological approaches for using these traits to develop heat-tolerant genotypes of various food crops.",,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.587264,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/13067,,2020-10-22,Frontiers in Plant Science,1664-462X,Frontiers Media,11,,,agriculture; crops; tolerance; physiology; heat-stress,

The global climate change is further accelerating the process of soil salinization, particularly in dry areas of the world. Increasing genetic variability of currently used wheat varieties by introgression of exotic alleles/genes from related progenitors’ species in breeding programs is an efficient approach to overcome limitations due to the absence of valuable genetic diversity in elite cultivars. Synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) is widely regarded as donor of favourable exotic alleles to improve tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses such as salinity stress. In this study, synthetic backcross lines (SBLs) winter wheat population “Z86”, derived from crosses involving synthetic hexaploid wheat Syn86L with German elite winter wheat cultivar Zentos, was evaluated for salinity tolerance at different developmental stages under controlled and field conditions in three growing seasons. High genetic variability was detected across the SBLs and their parents at various growth stages under controlled as well as under salt stress field trials. Greater performance of Zentos over Syn86L was detected at germination stage across all salt treatments and with respect to shoot dry weight (SDW) and root dry weight (RDW) at seedling stage. Whereas for the root length (RL) and the shoot length (SL) Syn86L surpassed the elite cultivar and most of the progenies. Our experiments revealed for almost all traits that some genotypes among the SBLs showed higher performance than their parents. Furthermore, positive transgressive segregations were detected among the SBLs for germination at high salinity levels, as well as for RDW and SDW at seedling stage. Therefore, the studied Z86 population is a suitable population for assessment of salinity stress on morphological and physiological traits at different plant growth stages. The identified SBLs provide a valuable source for genetic gain through recombination of superior alleles that can be directly applied in breeding programs for efficiently breeding cultivars with improved salinity tolerance and desired agronomic traits.",International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center - CIMMYT,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222659,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/10544,,2019-09-30,PLoS ONE,1932-6203,Public Library of Science,14,9,1-24,wheat; seed germination; salt stress; seedlings; genetic polymorphism; plant beeding,
The role of science and technology in enhancing food security in Arab countries,"Solh, Mahmoud",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,"The Arab world is the largest food deficit region in the world due to the major challenges facing increasing food production despite the high potential to increase agriculture production in most Arab countries. In 2013 the Arab world imported 85.6 million tons of cereals compared to 65.3 million tons for Asia, the second largest food importer. Several factors are behind the food deficit in the Arab world including water scarcity and very low water use efficiency; serious climate change implications including more frequent droughts and high temperature; desertification or land degradation due to excessive grazing, loss biodiversity and salinity due to faulty irrigation and sea water intrusion. Political instability is another important factor that contributed to widening the gap between domestic food production and consumption. However, these challenges can be overcome through innovations in science and technology can help in growth in sustainable food production and improve food security without depleting natural resources. This paper describes some of these innovations, developed jointly by national research institutions in collaboration with the International Center for Agricultural Research Dry Areas (ICARDA) and other partners. These include improved, adapted crop varieties with high yield potential and resistance/tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses; appropriate water management and more efficient water use; diversification and sustainable intensification of production systems which increase the returns to water and land used and reduce the risk associated with variable climatic environments. The paper provides on the ground examples in several Arab countries on bridging the yield gap between farmers yield levels of wheat and the levels of improved wheat production levels following improved varieties and agronomic practices. In an average of six seasons (2010/2011-2015/2016) involving whole provinces in nine Arab countries, wheat productivity yield gap was increased up to 124% under irrigated conditions in Sudan, up to 96% under supplemental irrigation in Yemen and up to 84% under rainfed conditions in Syria.

Facing these risks is the most important issue for sustainable development. Conventional tillage (CT) practices seem to expose the soils of semi-arid regions, which are initially fragile, to degradation that is accentuated by the overuse of the environment. The benefits of conservation agriculture (CA) could mitigate the degradation of natural resources, particularly soils. The adaptation and transfer of the no-till (NT) system with mulch open new perspectives for the development of agriculture in semi-arid regions. The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of conservation agriculture, especially no-till (NT) system, on the physical properties of soil (structural stability (SS), bulk density (BD), gravimetric water content (θg), and soil organic matter (SOM)) compared to conventional tillage (CT). The main changes associated with the transition from a CT system to an NT system were evaluated at the experimental site, Merchouch (M13), which is typified by vertisol soil, and at the Ain Sbit (AS7) site, which is characterized by isohumic soil. Under a no-till system, most of the physical properties of the soil were improved in both sites, with a clear difference in the M13 site. Structural stability under NT showed a significant increase in both sites (fast wetting (FW), slow wetting (SW), and wet stirring (WS) improved by 88, 43, and 83% at the M13 site, respectively, against, 16, 23, and 7%, respectively, at the AS7 site). On the other hand, the SOM increased from 2.0 to 2.6% (an improvement of 28%) at AS7 and from 1.2% to 1.9% (an improvement of 52%) at M13.

Integrated Microbiome and Metabolomic Analysis Reveal Responses of Rhizosphere Bacterial Communities and Root exudate Composition to Drought and Genotype in Rice (Oryza sativa L.),"Li, Gege; Wang, Kexin; Qin, Qun; Li, Qi; Mo, Fei; Nangia, Vinay; Liu, Yang",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Northwest A&F University - NWSUAF,"Background As climate change events become more frequent, drought is an increasing threat to agricultural production and food security. Crop rhizosphere microbiome and root exudates are critical regulators for drought adaptation, yet our understanding on the rhizosphere bacterial communities and root exudate composition as afected by drought stress is far from complete. In this study, we performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and widely targeted metabolomic analysis of rhizosphere soil and root exudates from two contrasting rice genotypes (Nipponbare and Luodao 998) exposed to drought stress. Results A reduction in plant phenotypes was observed under drought, and the inhibition was greater for roots than for shoots. Additionally, drought exerted a negligible efect on the alpha diversity of rhizosphere bacterial communities, but obviously altered their composition. In particular, drought led to a signifcant enrichment of Actinobacteria but a decrease in Firmicutes. We also found that abscisic acid in root exudates was clearly higher under drought, whereas lower jasmonic acid and L-cystine concentrations. As for plant genotypes, variations in plant traits of the drought-tolerant genotype Luodao 998 after drought were smaller than those of Nipponbare. Interestingly, drought triggered an increase in Bacillus, as well as an upregulation of most organic acids and a downregulation of all amino acids in Luodao 998. Notably, both Procrustes analysis and Mantel test demonstrated that rhizosphere microbi ome and root exudate metabolomic profles were highly correlated. A number of diferentially abundant genera responded to drought and genotype, including Streptomyces, Bacillus and some members of Actinobacteria, were sig nifcantly associated with organic acid and amino acid contents in root exudates. Further soil incubation experiments showed that Streptomyces was regulated by abscisic acid and jasmonic acid under drought. Conclusions Our results reveal that both drought and genotype drive changes in the compositions of rice rhizos phere bacterial communities and root exudates under the greenhouse condition, and that organic acid exudation and suppression of amino acid exudation to select specifc rhizosphere bacterial communities may be an important strategy for rice to cope with drought.

effects of annual burning on CO2 output from soils and SOC stocks. The study was performed on a 62 years
old field trial comparing annual burning (AB) to no burning associated with tree encroachment (NB), and to annual
mowing (AM) with all treatments laid out in randomized block design with three replicates per treatment.
CO2 emissions from soil were continuously measured over two years and were correlated to soil chemical and
physical properties. AB and AM produced 30 and 34% greater CO2 emissions from soil than NB (1.80 ± 0.13 vs.
2.34±0.18 and 2.41±0.17 g C-CO2m−2 d−1 for NB, AB and AMrespectively). AB and AMalso produced greater
CO2 emissions fromsoil and per gramof soil carbon (1.32±0.1 and 1.35±0.1 mgC-CO2 gC−1 d−1, respectively)
than NB(1.05±0.07mgC-CO2gC−1 d−1),which corresponded to significant differences of respectively 26% and
29%. Overall, CO2 emissions fromsoil (perm2) significantly increased with soil water content (r=0.72) followed
by SOC stocks (r= 0.59), SOC content (r =0.50), soil bulk density (r= 0.49), soil temperature (r=0.47), C:N

Human plant domestication began in the Fertile Crescent around 12,000 years ago and spread throughout the world, including China, Mesoamerica, the Andes and Near Oceania, Sub-Saharan Africa, and eastern North America. Indus valley civilizations have played a great role in the domestication of grain legumes. Crops, such as pigeon pea, black gram, green gram, lablab bean, moth bean, and horse gram, originated in the Indian subcontinent, and Neolithic archaeological records indicate that these crops were first domesticated by early civilizations in the region. The domestication and evolution of wild ancestors into today’s elite cultivars are important contributors to global food supply and agricultural crop improvement. In addition, food legumes contribute to food security by protecting human health and minimize climate change impacts. During the domestication process, legume crop species have undergone a severe genetic diversity loss, and only a very narrow range of variability is retained in the cultivars. Further reduction in genetic diversity occurred during seed dispersal and movement across the continents. In general, only a few traits, such as shattering resistance, seed dormancy loss, stem growth behavior, flowering–maturity period, and yield traits, have prominence in the domestication process across the species. Thus, identification and knowledge of domestication responsive loci were often useful in accelerating new species’ domestication. The genes and metabolic pathways responsible for the significant alterations that occurred as an outcome of domestication might aid in the quick domestication of novel crops. Further, recent advances in “omics” sciences, gene-editing technologies, and functional analysis will accelerate the domestication and crop improvement of new crop species without losing much genetic diversity. In this review, we have discussed about the origin, center of diversity, and seed movement of major food legumes, which will be useful in the exploration and utilization of genetic diversity in crop improvement. Further, we have discussed about the major genes/QTLs associated with the domestication syndrome in pulse crops and the future strategies to improve the food legume crops.",CGIAR Trust Fund,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2022.932430,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/67927,,2022-07-22,Frontiers in Genetics,1664-8021,Frontiers Media,13,,,"diversification; domestication; evolution; goal 2 zero hunger; domestication syndrome; pulse crop; divergence; nutrition, health and food security",
Simulating plant water stress dynamics in a wide range of bi-specific agrosystems in a region using the BISWAT model,"Bertrand, Nicolas; Roux, Sebastien; Forey, Oswaldo; Guinet, Maé; Wery, Jacques",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; Montpellier SupAgro - SupAgro,"The ability to simulate soil and crop processes in many bi-specific systems (vineyards, orchards, silvo-arable agroforestry, strip-intercropping of arable crops…) is one of the major challenge for crop modelling in order to contribute to the design of agro-ecological cropping systems. A typical question is how soil, climate and management would influence the soil water deficit experienced by a plant grown alone or intercropped with a cover crop, with another crop or a tree, in order to improve the resilience of a cropping system to climate change and limit the use of chemical input.

This study introduces BISWAT – Bispecific Intercrop System WATer Stress dynamic model - a new water balance model designed to simulate the dynamic of Soil Water deficit Experienced (SWEP) by two Plants when grown together or separated. BISWAT has been built to simulate a large range of agrosystems (annual and perennial crops, mono- or bi-specific) cultivated in various conditions. The model is primarily based on three modelling concepts: i) a 2D generic pattern for the system’s spatial representation, ii) the use of the Radiation Interception Efficiency (RIE) to drive potential plant transpiration and soil evaporation, iii) the use of the Total Transpirable Soil Water (TTSW) concept coupled with a simple root dynamics representation. These concepts are not new but they allowed us to define a model able to simulate many crops and trees (including vineyards) using a limited number of inputs and without an explicit need for parameter calibration.

The model was evaluated on five reference agrosystems (mono-specific salads, mono-specific vineyards, bi-specific vineyards, mono-specific peach orchards and bi-specific peach orchards). The RMSE of the SWEP variable ranged from 0.049 to 0.123. A combined sensitivity and uncertainty analysis performed on typical farmer’s fields situations stressed the particular importance of model inputs related to the TTSW of the soil-crop system.

We conclude that the genericity of the BISWAT model, its method of parameterization and its performance open the perspective to use the model in a wide range of conditions where the dynamic of water stress between two species grown together is a key variable to be accessed with limited data for parameterization and a large number of fields to simulate.",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2018.06.001,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/12636,,2018-07-21,European Journal of Agronomy,1161-0301,Elsevier B.V.,99,,116-128,agroforestry; intercropping; soil water deficit; water balance model; water stress indicator; crop diagnosis,FR
Water-harvesting designs for fruit tree production in dry environments,"Tubeileh, Ashraf; Bruggeman, Adriana; Turkelboom, Francis",International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA,"Water scarcity and increasing demand coupled with climate change require maximizing the use of available resources. Water harvesting (WH) systems are currently being used in many areas to sustain crops and increase water productivity. This study investigated the effect of three treatments (S15: 50-m(2) catchment area with 15% slope, S8: 50-m(2) catchment area with 8% slope, and L8: 70-m(2) catchment area with 8% slope) on the amount of water harvested in tree basin for young olive (Olea europaea L.) trees from November 2002 to July 2003. Soil moisture was monitored weekly during the rainy season and bi-weekly afterwards. To determine moisture changes in the catchment and target areas and amount of water harvested (in liters) for each tree, volumetric soil moisture content was measured at three or four points along the slope using a neutron probe down to a maximum depth of 120 cm, as soil depth allowed. WH structures increased soil moisture content in the rootzone compared to the catchment area. The rainfall threshold for runoff generation was less than 15 mm. Land slope was more important than micro catchment size for increasing the amount of water harvested. Compared to the 8% slope, the 15% slope resulted in larger harvested amounts for small storms, but the two were comparable when storms were large. The large micro-catchment size resulted in higher amounts of harvested water only in the presence of storms greater than 26 mm. After adding the amounts lost by evapotranspiration, the net amount of water harvested in the tree basin of each tree for the 2002-2003 rainy season reached 722 and 6881 (or 361 and 344mm) for treatments S15 and S8, respectively. Deeper soil profiles (i.e., >90 cm) were important to ensure longer storage periods. By early July, soil moisture content in the tree basin for treatments S15, L8 and S8 was still higher by 38, 13, and 5% respectively, than the levels recorded at the onset of the experiment. WH increased soil moisture content during the spring and early summer, a critical period for olive production. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Coupling Process-Based Models and Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting Yield and Evapotranspiration of Maize in Arid Environments,"Attia, Ahmed; Govind, Ajit; Qureshi, Asad Sarwar; Feike, Til; Rizk, Mosa Sayed; Shabana, Mahmoud Mohamed Abd ElHay; Kheir, Ahmed M.S.","International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas - ICARDA; International Center for Biosaline Agriculture - ICBA; Agricultural Research Center, Soil, Water and Environment Research Institute - ARC - SWERI; Julius Kühn-Institut - JKI (Germany); Agricultural Research Center, Field Crops Research Institute - ARC - FCRI","Crop yield prediction is critical for investigating the yield gap and potential adaptations to environmental and management factors in arid regions. Crop models (CMs) are powerful tools for predicting yield and water use, but they still have some limitations and uncertainties; therefore, combining them with machine learning algorithms (MLs) could improve predictions and reduce uncertainty. To that end, the DSSAT-CERES-maize model was calibrated in one location and validated in others across Egypt with varying agro-climatic zones. Following that, the dynamic model (CERES-Maize) was used for long-term simulation (1990–2020) of maize grain yield (GY) and evapotranspiration (ET) under a wide range of management and environmental factors. Detailed outputs from three growing seasons of field experiments in Egypt, as well as CERES-maize outputs, were used to train and test six machine learning algorithms (linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, and XGBoost), resulting in more than 1.5 million simulated yield and evapotranspiration scenarios. Seven warming years (i.e., 1991, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2010, 2013, and 2020) were chosen from a 31-year dataset to test MLs, while the remaining 23 years were used to train the models. The Ensemble model (super learner) and XGBoost outperform other models in predicting GY and ET for maize, as evidenced by R2 values greater than 0.82 and RRMSE less than 9%. The broad range of management practices, when averaged across all locations and 31 years of simulation, not only reduced the hazard impact of environmental factors but also increased GY and reduced ET. Moving beyond prediction and interpreting the outputs from Lasso and XGBoost, and using global and local SHAP values, we found that the most important features for predicting GY and ET are maximum temperatures, minimum temperature, available water content, soil organic carbon, irrigation, cultivars, soil texture, solar radiation, and planting date. Determining the most important features is critical for assisting farmers and agronomists in prioritizing such features over other factors in order to increase yield and resource efficiency values. The combination of CMs and ML algorithms is a powerful tool for predicting yield and water use in arid regions, which are particularly vulnerable to climate change and water scarcity.",,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14223647,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/68237,,2022-11-12,WATER,2073-4441,MDPI,14,22,,water use; random forest; dssat models; xgboost; super learner; lasso regression; hyperparameters tuning; feature importance,EG

Here, we argue that to tackle the above contrasting issues dealing with land degradation, it is very much required to develop and use friendly and freely available web-based operational tools to support both the implementation of environmental and agriculture policies and enable to take positive environmental sustainability actions by all stakeholders. Our solution is the S-DSS LANDSUPPORT platform, consisting of a free web-based smart Geospatial CyberInfrastructure containing 15 macro-tools (and more than 100 elementary tools), co-designed with different types of stakeholders and their different needs, dealing with sustainability in agriculture, forestry and spatial planning. LANDSUPPORT condenses many features into one system, the main ones of which were (i) Web-GIS facilities, connection with (ii) satellite data, (iii) Earth Critical Zone data and (iv) climate datasets including climate change and weather forecast data, (v) data cube technology enabling us to read/write when dealing with very large datasets (e.g. daily climatic data obtained in real time for any region in Europe), (vi) a large set of static and dynamic modelling engines (e.g. crop growth, water balance, rural integrity, etc.) allowing uncertainty analysis and what if modelling and (vii) HPC (both CPU and GPU) to run simulation modelling ‘on-the-fly’ in real time. Two case studies (a third case is reported in the Supplementary materials), with their results and stats, covering different regions and spatial extents and using three distinct operational tools all connected to lower land degradation processes (Crop growth, Machine Learning Forest Simulator and GeOC), are featured in this paper to highlight the platform's functioning. Landsupport is used by a large community of stakeholders and will remain operational, open and free long after the project ends.

Conservation Agriculture (CA) considered as “climate-smart” agriculture, strives to achieve acceptable profits along with high and sustained production levels while concurrently conserving and regenerating soils and protecting the environment. The objectives of this paper are to review and synthesize available findings on CA, its past trends, current opportunities and challenges, evidence on potential benefits from its adaptation, to discuss its future outlook, and to make relevant recommendations for interventions and novel research needs for its wider diffusion in the region.

In MENA, major research on CA has been mainly conducted in Morocco, Tunisia, Iran, and Syria, while Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt embarked CA research fairly recently. About 25–40% out of the 53 million hectares total arable land is estimated to be suitable for CA in the region. In recent years a growing number of studies carried under a range of climatic, soil, management and cropping conditions in many countries of MENA reported several benefits including higher and more stable yields and profits, reduced risks of crop loss, labor requirements, soil erosion, and improved soil moisture and quality under CA system. Despite its benefits, adoption of CA in MENA is still very low for various reasons including: lack of affordable and well-adapted seeders, the complexity of the CA system which posed a major challenge for mostly uneducated farmers to comprehend, ill-conceived policies that promote cereal intensification hence inadvertently promote monocropping, tradeoffs between residue retention and livestock feed, lack of adequate policy and institutional framework and incentives to enhance farmers’ adoption, and the private sector's active involvement in the dissemination of CA. The wider acceptance of CA requires the development of affordable and versatile no-till seeder alongside the implementation of integrated crop management practices. CA-based bundled agronomic management practices must be tailored to the biophysical and socio-economic environment. Finally, effective strategies for upscaling CA in MENA has to be developed by taking into consideration the unique features of the region. Despite the daunting past adoption trends and current challenges, we predict a bright future for CA in the region due to several factors including: rising energy prices and wage rates, the emergence of younger and more educated farmers, the advent of climate change, the increasing awareness on the degradation of land and water resources among farmers and policy makers, changes in dietary preferences subsequently increasing trends in demand and prices of legumes are expected to increase the desirability of CA and enhance its wider diffusion in MENA.",International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center - CIMMYT,en,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.agron.2021.11.001,Timeless limited access,,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/66826,,2021-12-10,Advances in Agronomy,0065-2113,Elsevier Ltd.,172,,,conservation agriculture; drylands; soil organic matter; crop-livestock integration; crop productivity; crop-residue,

Orobanche  crenata,O.  cumana, O.  foetida, O. minor,Phelipanche aegyptiaca andP. ramoseare the most economically  damaging  species  and  cause  severe  yield losses   on   many   crops   especially   in   the   Mediterranean region. In  Tunisia, O.  foetida,  O.  crenata,  O.  cumana,and P.  ramosawere  found  parasitizing  many  cultivated  crops (Kharrat et  al.,1992;  Kharrat,  2002; Amri etal.,2012, 2013). O.  crenatawas  mentioned  for  a  long  time  as  a serious  problem  for  many  legume  crops  in  Tunisia,  but O. foetidahas  been  described  as  an  emerging  problem  for legume  production  especially  faba  bean  (Kharrat et  al.,1992; Kharrat, 2002). Nowadays, O. foetida andO. crenata have become  major  problems  not  only  for  faba  bean  but also  for  many  other  legume  crops  such  as  chickpea  (Cicer arietinumL.),  lentil  (Lens  culinaris Medik.),  grass  pea (Lathyrus sativusL.), medick (Medicago truncatulaand M.  scutellata),  common   vetch  (Vicia  sativaL.)  and narbon vetch (Vicia narbonensis L.)

The current infested area in Tunisia is estimated to cover more than 50,000 ha located in the main grain  legume  production  area  (Fig.  1).  Several  potential methods and strategies; chemical, agricultural and biological were  used  and  divulgated  to  farmers  but  unfortunately  for several   reasons,   all   strategies   resulted   in   incomplete protection   and   broomrape   remains   as   an   uncontrolled agricultural   problem.   The   most   effective   way   to   fight orobanche  is  through  an  integrated  management  approach based  mainly  on  the selection  of  genetic  material  carrying tolerance  to  orobanche.  During  the  last  decades,  several varieties/lines   were   developed   and   released   in   many countries;  Baraca,  VF1071,  VF136  and  VF172  in  Spain, Giza  4,  Giza  842,  Sakha,  Misr1  (667/153/87),  Misr3(X-1722) and Cairo 4, Cairo 5 and Cairo 25 in Egypt (Abdallaand Darwish, 2008; Attia et al.,2013; Rubiales et al., 2014). Numerous  studies  showed  that  different mechanisms  were involved   in   the   resistance   such   as   low   number   of underground    and    emerged    orobanche,    reduced    seed germination     stimulant     production,     host     plant     root architecture  and  physical  barrier (Perez-De-Luqueet  al.,2005; 2006a; Abbes et al., 2010; 2011; Fernandez-Aparicioet al., 2014; Trabelsi et al., 2015, 2017).In   Tunisia,   a   breeding   program   aiming   to   the development  of  faba  bean  varieties  tolerant  to O.  foetida was  initiated  during  the  past  several  years  at  the  Institut National   de   la   Recherche   Agronomique   de   Tunisie (INRAT). The  first  partially  resistant  faba  bean  cultivar (‘Najeh’)  was  realesed  in  2009  and  registered  it  in  the Tunisian Official Catalogue of Plant Variety (Kharrat et al., 2010). In  2014,  a  new  faba  bean  small  seeded  variety ""Chourouk""  (XAR-VF00.13-10-2-3-1-2-1)  was  registered also   in   the   Tunisian   National   Plant   Variety   Catalogue (JORT  N°42,  May  26th,  2015;  COV  N°  117,  March  02nd, 2015). It was developed from a cross performed by INRAT (National  Institute  for  Agricultural  Research  of  Tunisia) at Ariana,  Tunisia  in  2000  and  selected  after  several  years  of single  plant  selection  in  different  orobanche  infested  plots. The purpose of the present research work was to report the performances  of  the  newly  developed  variety  Chourouk under field and controlled conditions.","Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Fisheries - MARHP; Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research - MESRS",en,,Open access,CC-BY-NC-4.0,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11766/9679,,2019-01-22,International Journal of Agriculture and Biology,1560-8530,Smith and Franklin Academic Publishing,21,,499-505,tunisia; orobanche crenata; vicia faba; faba bean; orobanche foetida; resistance; chourouk,TN
