"Women, economic resilience, gender norms in a time of climate change: what do we know?","Farnworth, C.; Rietveld, A.M.; Voss, R.C.; Meentzen, A.","This literature delves into 82 research articles, published between 2016 and 2022, to develop a deep understanding of how women manage their lives and livelihoods within their agrifood systems when these systems are being affected, sometimes devastatingly, by climate change. The Findings show that four core gender norms affect the ability of women to achieve economic resilience in the face of climate change operate in agrifood production systems. Each of these gender norms speaks to male privilege: (i) Men are primary decision-makers, (ii) Men are breadwinners, (iii) Men control assets, and (iv) Men are food system actors. These gender norms are widely held and challenge women’s abilities to become economically resilient. These norms are made more powerful still because they fuse with each other and act on multiple levels, and they serve to support other norms which limit women’s scope to act. It is particularly noteworthy that many institutional actors, ranging from community decision-makers to development partners, tend to reinforce rather than challenge gender norms because they do not critically review their own assumptions. 
However, the four gender norms cited are not hegemonic. First, there is limited and intriguing evidence that intersectional identities can influence women’s resilience in significant ways. Second, gender norms governing women’s roles and power in agrifood systems are changing in response to climate change and other forces, with implications for how women respond to future climate shocks. Third, paying attention to local realities is important – behaviours do not necessarily substantiate local norms. Fourth, women experience strong support from other women in savings groups, religious organisations, reciprocal labour, and others. Fifth, critical moments, such as climate disasters, offer potentially pivotal moments of change which could permit women unusually high levels of agency to overcome restrictive gender norms without being negatively sanctioned. The article concludes with recommendations for further research.",HER PLUS CGIAR Initiative,English,,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22996,2023,,[CIMMYT],,economics; resilience; climate change; gender norms; agrifood systems; women; economic resilience; intersectional identities; women groups support
Economics of crop residue management,"Krishna, V.; Mkondiwa, M.","More than five billion metric tons of agricultural residues are produced annually worldwide. Despite having multiple uses and significant potential to augment crop and livestock production, a large share of crop residues is burned, especially in Asian countries. This unsustainable practice causes tremendous air pollution and health hazards while restricting soil nutrient recycling. In this review, we examine the economic rationale for unsustainable residue management. The sustainability of residue utilization is determined by several economic factors, such as local demand for and quantity of residue production, development and dissemination of technologies to absorb excess residue, and market and policy instruments to internalize the social costs of residue burning. The intervention strategy to ensure sustainable residue management depends on public awareness of the private and societal costs of open residue burning.",,English,10.1146/annurev-resource-101422-090019,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22942,2023,Annual Review of Resource Economics,Annual Reviews Inc.,19-39,crops; biomass; residues; environmental impact; climate change; smallholders; technology adoption; crop biomass; residue burning; environmental effects
"Sustainability evaluation of contrasting milpa systems in the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico","Gonzalez-Esquivel, C.; Briones-Guzmán, C.; Tovar López, E.; Lopez-Ridaura, S.; Arnés, E.; Camacho Villa, T.C.","The milpa agroecosystem is an intercropping of maize, beans, squash and other crops, developed in Mesoamerica, and its adoption is widely variable across climates and regions. An example of particular interest is the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, which holds highly diverse milpas, drawing on ancestral Mayan knowledge. Traditional milpas have been described as sustainable resource management models, based on long rotations within a slash-and-burn cycle in forest areas. Nevertheless, due to modernization and intensification processes, new variants of the approach have appeared. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sustainability of three milpa systems (traditional, continuous, and mechanized) in four case studies across the Peninsula, with emphasis on food self-sufficiency, social inclusion and adoption of innovations promoted by a development project. The Framework for the Evaluation of Agroecosystems using Indicators (MESMIS, for its Spanish acronym) was used for its flexible, participatory approach. A common group of indicators was developed despite regional differences between study cases, with a high level of farmer participation throughout the iterative process. The results show lower crop yields in traditional systems, but with lower inputs costs and pesticide use. In contrast, continuous milpas had higher value in terms of crop diversity, food security, social inclusion, and innovation adoption. Mechanized milpas had lower weed control costs. Profitability of cash crops and the proportion of forest were high in all systems. Highly adopted innovations across milpa types and study cases included spatial crop arrangement and the use of residues as mulches. However, most innovations are not adapted to local conditions, and do not address climate change. Further, women and youth participation is low, especially in traditional systems.",,English,10.1007/s10668-023-04281-y,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22887,2023,"Environment, Development and Sustainability",Springer,,sustainability; intercropping; food security; innovation; social inclusion; agroecosystems; case studies; milpa; intensification processes; women and youth participation
Character association study in maize hybrids developed through integration of rapid cycle genomic selection and doubled haploid technology for heat stress tolerance,"Swamy, N.; Kuchanur, P.; Patil, A.; Zaidi, P.; Vinayan, M.T.; Arunkumar, B.; Sowmya, H.C.; Dhanoji, M.M.","Heat stress is becoming a major constraint for maize production; therefore heat stress resilience has emerged as an important aspect in maize hybrids targeted for post rainy spring season. Selection of genotypes based on high grain yield under heat stress condition is often misleading and the identification of secondary traits also associated with grain yield may help in development of heat tolerant cultivars. Hence, the present research work to study the association of traits was conducted during summer and kharif 2018 and rabi 2018-19 at Bheemarayanagudi and Raichur using 111 testcross progenies of doubled haploids derived from C1, C2 and C3 cycles of multi-parental synthetic population 1 and 2 improved through rapid cycle genomic selection for heat stress tolerance. The phenotypic correlation analysis under heat stress and optimal conditions, number of kernels per cob and cob girth exhibited the strong positive association with grain yield per plant. Further, under early spring condition number of kernels per cob, cob length, cob girth and 100 grain weight recorded the strong positive association with grain yield per plant. However, when considering across heat stress, early spring and optimal conditions, the grain yield per plant showed positive and significant strong to moderate association with the traits viz., number of kernels per cob, cob length and cob girth under all the seasons. In addition, days to 50% silking showed significant negative correlation with grain yield per plant under heat stress and optimal condition. Hence, the simultaneous selection criteria for the genotypes that exerts early silking, higher number of kernels per cob, higher cob girth and lengthy cob should be the priority of breeders to achieve higher grain yields in maize under heat stress condition as well as optimal conditions.",United States Agency for International Development (USAID),English,10.9734/ijecc/2023/v13i113323,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22863,2023,International Journal of Environment and Climate Change,Sciencedomain International,1678-1693,maize; heat stress; marker-assisted selection; doubled haploids; phenotypic variation; climate change; multi-parental synthetics; rapid cycle genomic selection; phenotypic correlation
Willingness to pay (WTP) for heat-tolerant maize hybrids in the Mid-Western Terai region of Nepal,"Kulkarni, A.P.; Tripathi, M.P.; Gautam, D.; Koirala, K.B.; Kandel, M.; Regmi, D.; Sapkota, S.; Zaidi, P.","High atmospheric temperatures can reduce maize production in different parts of Asia. Heat stress is the major driving force behind the need for varietal development that confers a heat tolerance trait (drought + heat tolerant) to maize hybrids. CIMMYT has developed heat-tolerant maize hybrids and deployed them in the market in collaboration with NARS partners. This study was conducted to estimate farmers’ willingness to pay for heat-tolerant maize hybrids in the Terai region of Nepal. A socioeconomic survey of 404 randomly selected maize-growing households was conducted to estimate farmers’ willingness to pay using the contingent valuation method. Given the economic importance of heat-tolerant maize hybrids in maize cultivation, the survey showed that the average WTP for heat-tolerant maize hybrids was 71% more than that for the current varieties in the market, including overall seed sources and subsidized seed. Without a subsidy, the farmers’ WTP price was at a 19% premium compared to the average price paid for conventional hybrids. Factors such as education, owning land, the interaction of hybrid adopters and owning land, soil depth, the number of goats/sheep, and the semi-pucca homes of households influenced the WTP for heat-tolerant maize hybrids. Heterogeneous demand was observed with respect to years of hybrid maize cultivation, farmers’ association with the network group, and the gender of the head of the household. In the context of climate change and global warming scenarios, Nepal’s agriculture policy should prioritize increasing domestic seed production and the distribution of heat-tolerant maize hybrids through a public–private partnership model.",United States Agency for International Development (USAID),English,10.3390/su15043068,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22861,2023,Sustainability,MDPI,,heat tolerance; maize; hybrids; willingness to pay; contingent valuation; heat-tolerant maize hybrid; preference heterogeneity
Genome editing for sustainable agriculture in Africa,"Leena Tripathi; Dhugga, K.; Valentine O. Ntui; Runo, S.; Easter D. Syombua; Samwel Muiruri; Zhengyu Wen; Tripathi, J.","Sustainable intensification of agriculture in Africa is essential for accomplishing food and nutritional security and addressing the rising concerns of climate change. There is an urgent need to close the yield gap in staple crops and enhance food production to feed the growing population. In order to meet the increasing demand for food, more efficient approaches to produce food are needed. All the tools available in the toolbox, including modern biotechnology and traditional, need to be applied for crop improvement. The full potential of new breeding tools such as genome editing needs to be exploited in addition to conventional technologies. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR/Cas)-based genome editing has rapidly become the most prevalent genetic engineering approach for developing improved crop varieties because of its simplicity, efficiency, specificity, and easy to use. Genome editing improves crop variety by modifying its endogenous genome free of any foreign gene. Hence, genome-edited crops with no foreign gene integration are not regulated as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in several countries. Researchers are using CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing for improving African staple crops for biotic and abiotic stress resistance and improved nutritional quality. Many products, such as disease-resistant banana, maize resistant to lethal necrosis, and sorghum resistant to the parasitic plant Striga and enhanced quality, are under development for African farmers. There is a need for creating an enabling environment in Africa with science-based regulatory guidelines for the release and adoption of the products developed using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Some progress has been made in this regard. Nigeria and Kenya have recently published the national biosafety guidelines for the regulation of gene editing. This article summarizes recent advances in developments of tools, potential applications of genome editing for improving staple crops, and regulatory policies in Africa.",,English,10.3389/fgeed.2022.876697,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22753,2022,Frontiers in Genome Editing,Frontiers Media S.A.,,crops; agriculture; crispr; gene editing; policies; genome editing; african crops; regulatory policies
Silage maize as a potent candidate for sustainable animal husbandry development—perspectives and strategies for genetic enhancement,"Karnatam, K.S.; Mythri, B.; Wajhat Un Nisa; Sharma, H.; Kumar, T.; Rana, P.; Vikal, Y.; Gowda, M.; Dhillon, B.S.; Sandhu, S.","Maize is recognized as the queen of cereals, with an ability to adapt to diverse agroecologies (from 58oN to 55oS latitude) and the highest genetic yield potential among cereals. Under contemporary conditions of global climate change, C4 maize crops offer resilience and sustainability to ensure food, nutritional security, and farmer livelihood. In the northwestern plains of India, maize is an important alternative to paddy for crop diversification in the wake of depleting water resources, reduced farm diversity, nutrient mining, and environmental pollution due to paddy straw burning. Owing to its quick growth, high biomass, good palatability, and absence of anti-nutritional components, maize is also one of the most nutritious non-legume green fodders. It is a high-energy, low-protein forage commonly used for dairy animals like cows and buffalos, often in combination with a complementary high-protein forage such as alfalfa. Maize is also preferred for silage over other fodders due to its softness, high starch content, and sufficient soluble sugars required for proper ensiling. With a rapid population increase in developing countries like China and India, there is an upsurge in meat consumption and, hence, the requirement for animal feed, which entails high usage of maize. The global maize silage market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.84% from 2021 to 2030. Factors such as increasing demand for sustainable and environment-friendly food sources coupled with rising health awareness are fueling this growth. With the dairy sector growing at about 4%–5% and the increasing shortage faced for fodder, demand for silage maize is expected to increase worldwide. The progress in improved mechanization for the provision of silage maize, reduced labor demand, lack of moisture-related marketing issues as associated with grain maize, early vacancy of farms for next crops, and easy and economical form of feed to sustain household dairy sector make maize silage a profitable venture. However, sustaining the profitability of this enterprise requires the development of hybrids specific for silage production. Little attention has yet been paid to breeding for a plant ideotype for silage with specific consideration of traits such as dry matter yield, nutrient yield, energy in organic matter, genetic architecture of cell wall components determining their digestibility, stalk standability, maturity span, and losses during ensiling. This review explores the available information on the underlying genetic mechanisms and gene/gene families impacting silage yield and quality. The trade-offs between yield and nutritive value in relation to crop duration are also discussed. Based on available genetic information on inheritance and molecular aspects, breeding strategies are proposed to develop maize ideotypes for silage for the development of sustainable animal husbandry.",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF); United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research (FFAR),English,10.3389/fgene.2023.1150132,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22752,2023,Frontiers in Genetics,Frontiers Media S.A.,,biomass; silage; digestibility; genome-wide association studies; marker-assisted selection; maize; brown mid-rib; genomic selection
Remote sensing hail damage on maize crops in smallholder farms using data acquired by remotely piloted aircraft system,"Sibanda, M.; Ndlovu, H.S.; Brewer, K.; Buthelezi, S.; Trylee N. Matongera; Mutanga, O.; Odidndi, J.; Clulow, A.D.; Chimonyo, V.G.P.; Mabhaudhi, T.","Smallholder farmers reside in marginal environments typified by dryland maize-based farming systems. Despite the significant contribution of smallholder farmers to food production, they are vulnerable to extreme weather events such as hailstorms, floods and drought. Extreme weather events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity under climate change, threatening the sustainability of smallholder farming systems. Access to climate services and information, as well as digital advisories such as Robust spatially explicit monitoring techniques from remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), could be instrumental in understanding the impact and extent of crop damage. It could assist in providing adequate response mechanisms suitable for bolstering crop productivity in a spatially explicit manner. This study, therefore, sought to evaluate the utility of drone-derived multispectral data in estimating crop productivity elements (Equivalent water thickness (EWT), Chlorophyll content, and leaf area index (LAI)) in maize smallholder croplands based on the random forest regression algorithm. A hailstorm occurred in the study area during the reproductive stages 2 to 3 and 3 to 4. EWT, Chlorophyll content, and LAI were measured before and after the storm. Results of this study showed that EWT, Chlorophyll content, and LAI could be optimally estimated based on the red edge and its spectral derivatives. Specifically, EWT was estimated to a rRMEs 2.7% and 59%, RMSEs of 5.31 gm−2 and 27.35 gm-2, R2 of 0.88 and 0.77, while chlorophyll exhibited rRMSE of 28% and 25%, RMSEs of 87.4 µmol m−2 and 76.2 µmol m−2 and R2 of 0.89 and 0.80 and LAI yielded a rRMSE of 10.9% and 15.2%, RMSEs of 0.6 m2/m2 and 0.19 m2/m2 before and after the hail damage, respectively. Overall, the study underscores the potential of RPAS-based remote sensing as a valuable resource for assessing crop damage and responding to the impact of hailstorms on crop productivity in smallholder croplands. This offers a means to enhance agricultural resilience and adaptability under climate change.",,English,10.1016/j.atech.2023.100325,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22746,2023,Smart Agricultural Technology,Elsevier B.V.,,hail damage; remote sensing; unmanned aerial vehicles; maize; crops; smallholders; small-scale croplands; random forest
Wheat crop traits conferring high yield potential may also improve yield stability under climate change,"Stella, T.; Webber, H.; Rezaei, E.E.; Asseng, S.; Martre, P.; Dueri, S.; Guarin, J.R.; Pequeno, D.N.L.; Calderini, D.; Reynolds, M.P.; Molero, G.; Miralles, D.; Garcia, G.; Slafer, G.; Giunta, F.; Kim, Y.U.; Chenzhi Wang; Ruane, A.C.; Ewert, F.","Increasing genetic wheat yield potential is considered by many as critical to increasing global wheat yields and production, baring major changes in consumption patterns. Climate change challenges breeding by making target environments less predictable, altering regional productivity and potentially increasing yield variability. Here we used a crop simulation model solution in the SIMPLACE framework to explore yield sensitivity to select trait characteristics (radiation use efficiency [RUE], fruiting efficiency and light extinction coefficient) across 34 locations representing the world’s wheat-producing environments, determining their relationship to increasing yields, yield variability and cultivar performance. The magnitude of the yield increase was trait-dependent and differed between irrigated and rainfed environments. RUE had the most prominent marginal effect on yield, which increased by about 45 % and 33 % in irrigated and rainfed sites, respectively, between the minimum and maximum value of the trait. Altered values of light extinction coefficient had the least effect on yield levels. Higher yields from improved traits were generally associated with increased inter-annual yield variability (measured by standard deviation), but the relative yield variability (as coefficient of variation) remained largely unchanged between base and improved genotypes. This was true under both current and future climate scenarios. In this context, our study suggests higher wheat yields from these traits would not increase climate risk for farmers and the adoption of cultivars with these traits would not be associated with increased yield variability.",,English,10.1093/insilicoplants/diad013,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22741,2023,In Silico Plants,Oxford University Press,,climate change; genetics; yield potential; wheat; climate risk; genetic yield potential; yield variability
Unsupervised segmentation and clustering time series approach to Southern Africa rainfall regime changes,"Chipindu, L.; Mupangwa, W.; Nyagumbo, I.; Zaman-Allah, M.","Analysis of hydro-climatological time series and spatiotemporal dynamics of meteorological variables has become critical in the context of climate change, especially in Southern African countries where rain-fed agriculture is predominant. In this work, we compared modern unsupervised time series and segmentation approaches and commonly used time series models to analyse rainfall regime changes in the coastal, sub-humid and semi-arid regions of Southern Africa. Rainfall regimes change modelling and prediction inform farming strategies especially when choosing measures for mixed crop–livestock farming systems, as farmers can decide to do rainwater harvesting and moisture conservation or supplementary irrigation if water resources are available. The main goal of this study was to predict/identify rainfall cluster trends over time using regression with hidden logistic process (RHLP) or hidden Markov model regression (HMMR) supplemented by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and Facebook Prophet models. Historical time series rainfall data was sourced from meteorological services departments for selected site over an average period of 55 years. Commonly used approaches forecasted an upward rainfall trend in the coastal and sub-humid regions and a declining trend in semi-arid areas with high variability between and within seasons. For all sites, Ljung-Box Test Statistics suggested the existence of autocorrelation in rainfall time series data. Prediction capabilities were investigated using the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) which indicated not much difference between ARIMA and Facebook Prophet models. RHLP and HMMR offered a unique clustering and segmentation approach examining between and within-season rainfall variability. A maximum of 20 unique rainfall clusters with similar trend characteristics were determined as going beyond this brought non-significant difference to regime changes. A clear trend was exhibited from 1980 going backwards as compared to recent years signifying how unpredictable is rainfall in Southern Africa. The unsupervised approaches predicted a clear cluster trend in coastal than in sub-humid and semi-arid and the performance was assessed using Akaike information criteria and log-likelihood which showed improvement in prediction power as the number of segmentation clusters approaches 20.",United States Agency for International Development (USAID),English,10.1002/gdj3.228,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22743,2023,Geoscience Data Journal,John Wiley & Sons Inc.,,coastal areas; semiarid zones; subhumid zones; rainfall; climate change; autoregressive integrated moving average; facebook prophet; hidden markov model regression; regression with hidden logistic process
Redesigning crop varieties to win the race between climate change and food security,"Pixley, K.V.; Cairns, J.E.; Lopez-Ridaura, S.; Ojiewo, C.O.; Maryam Abba Dawud; Drabo, I.; Taye Mindaye; Nebie, B.; Asea, G.; Das, B.; Daudi, H.; Desmae, H.S.; Batieno, B.J.; Boukar, O.; Mukankusi, C.; Nkalubo, S.; Hearne, S.; Dhugga, K.; Gandhi, H.; Snapp, S.S.; Zepeda Villarreal, E.A.","Climate change poses daunting challenges to agricultural production and food security. Rising temperatures, shifting weather patterns, and more frequent extreme events have already demonstrated their effects on local, regional, and global agricultural systems. Crop varieties that withstand climate-related stresses and are suitable for cultivation in innovative cropping systems will be crucial to maximize risk avoidance, productivity, and profitability under climate-changed environments. We surveyed 588 expert stakeholders to predict current and novel traits that may be essential for future pearl millet, sorghum, maize, groundnut, cowpea, and common bean varieties, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. We then review the current progress and prospects for breeding three prioritized future-essential traits for each of these crops. Experts predict that most current breeding priorities will remain important, but that rates of genetic gain must increase to keep pace with climate challenges and consumer demands. Importantly, the predicted future-essential traits include innovative breeding targets that must also be prioritized; for example, (1) optimized rhizosphere microbiome, with benefits for P, N, and water use efficiency, (2) optimized performance across or in specific cropping systems, (3) lower nighttime respiration, (4) improved stover quality, and (5) increased early vigor. We further discuss cutting-edge tools and approaches to discover, validate, and incorporate novel genetic diversity from exotic germplasm into breeding populations with unprecedented precision, accuracy, and speed.

"Determining factors of durum wheat bread loaf volume and alveograph characteristics under optimal, drought and heat stress conditions","Labuschagne, M.; Guzman, C.; Crossa, J.; Biljon, A.","Durum wheat is an important crop, especially in Mediterrannean countries; around 25% of durum wheat world-wide, and 70–90% in the Middle East, is used for bread making. Climate change is causing increased periods of drought stress and higher temperatures which are affecting wheat quality. Alveograph extensibility is important for durum wheat loaf volume (LFV), as is the relationship between dough tenacity and extensibility. This study was done to identify the factors determining LFV and alveograph properties under optimal and stress conditions. Six durum wheat cultivars with the same glutenin composition were grown for two seasons under optimal, drought and heat stress conditions. Good LFV was consistently related with higher dough extensibility, irrespective of production conditions. A number of the LMW glutenin fractions, and the γ-gliadins were significantly reduced and β-gliadins were increased under both heat and drought stress. The large and total unextractable polymeric proteins and unextractable HMW glutenins were significantly reduced by heat stress. In a multiple regression of LFV (without alveograph values), solvent retention capacity and sodium dodecyl sulphate sedimentation were the best predictors of LFV under all conditions. Size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography fractions combined with flour protein content were good predictors of LFV only under optimal conditions.",,English,10.1016/j.jcs.2023.103791,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22736,2023,Journal of Cereal Science,Academic Press Inc.,,alveographs; hard wheat; heat stress; drought stress; loaf volume; durum wheat; flour protein content

"Soil moisture content and maize grain yield under conventional and conservation agriculture practices - results of short term field tests in liselo, Namibia","Kudumo, L.P.; Itanna, F.; Thierfelder, C.; Kambatuku, J.","This article focuses on the results from trials developed to monitor the short-term effects of conventionally tilled systems versus CA on soil quality and crop productivity under conditions of the major cropping systems in central, north-central and north-eastern regions of Namibia. Conventional tillage (CT), Minimum tillage (MT), Minimum tillage, mulch (MT-M), Minimum tillage, rotation (MT-R) and Minimum tillage, mulch and rotation (MT-MR) were the primary treatments tested. Significant differences (p≤0.000) among the treatments were observed in the 0-60 cm soil profiles where MT-M plots had the highest soil moisture content (39.8 mm, Standard Error of Mean 0.2815) over the study period. A significant difference (p=0.0206) in grain yield was observed in the second season with CT plots yielding the highest grain yield (3852.3 kg ha-1, standard error of mean 240.35). Results suggest that CA has the potential to increase water conservation and contribute to reduction of the risk of crop failure. Climate change driven degradation under conventional tillage necessitate alternative sustainable tillage methods. Conservation tillage methods and conservation agricultural practices that minimize soil disturbance while maintaining soil cover need to be adopted more locally as viable alternatives to conventional tillage.",Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH,English,10.5897/AJAR2023.16327,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22704,2023,African Journal of Agricultural Research,Academic Journals,891-896,conservation agriculture; conventional tillage; grain; yields; soil water content; maize; grain yield; soil moisture content
High-resolution CMIP6 climate projections for Ethiopia using the gridded statistical downscaling method,"Mequanint, F.; Gayler, S.; Weber, T.K.D.; Tesfaye, K.; Streck, T.","High-resolution climate model projections for a range of emission scenarios are needed for designing regional and local adaptation strategies and planning in the context of climate change. To this end, the future climate simulations of global circulation models (GCMs) are the main sources of critical information. However, these simulations are not only coarse in resolution but also associated with biases and high uncertainty. To make the simulations useful for impact modeling at regional and local level, we utilized the bias correction constructed analogues with quantile mapping reordering (BCCAQ) statistical downscaling technique to produce a 10 km spatial resolution climate change projections database based on 16 CMIP6 GCMs under three emission scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). The downscaling strategy was evaluated using a perfect sibling approach and detailed results are presented by taking two contrasting (the worst and best performing models) GCMs as a showcase. The evaluation results demonstrate that the downscaling approach substantially reduced model biases and generated higher resolution daily data compared to the original GCM outputs.",,English,10.1038/s41597-023-02337-2,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22656,2023,Scientific Data,Nature Publishing Group,442,climate change; hydrology; crop modelling; data; high-resolution climate models; global circulation models; bias correction constructed analogues; cmip6
Maximizing soil organic carbon stocks under cover cropping: insights from long-term agricultural experiments in North America,"Yajun Peng; Rieke, E.L.; Chahal, I.; Norris, C.E.; Janovicek, K.; Mitchell, J.P.; Roozeboom, K.L.; Hayden, Z.D.; Strock, J.S.; Machado, S.; Sykes, V.R.; Deen, B.; Bañuelos, O.; Gamble, A.V.; Scow, K.M.; Brainard, D.C.; Millar, N.; Johnson, G.A.; Schindelbeck, R.R.; Kurtz, K.; Van Es, H.M.; Sandeep Kumar; Van Eerd, L.L.","Cover crops are widely advocated for increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, thereby benefiting soil health improvement and climate change mitigation. Few regional-scale studies have robustly explored SOC stocks under cover cropping, due to limited long-term experiments. We used the unique experimental data from the North American Project to Evaluate Soil Health Measurements conducted in 2019 to address this issue. This study included 19 agricultural research sites with 36 pairs of cover cropping established between 1896 and 2014. Explanatory variables related to site-specific environmental conditions and management practices were collected to identify and prioritize contributing factors that affect SOC stocks with cover crops, by coupling the Boruta algorithm and structural equation modeling. Overall, cover crops significantly (P < 0.05) improved several indicators of soil health, including greater SOC (concentration: +8%; stock: +7%), total nitrogen (+8%), water-stable aggregates (+15%), and potential carbon mineralization (+34%), on average, compared to no cover crop control. Likewise, on average, cover crops sequestered SOC 3.55 Mg C ha-1 (0–15 cm depth), with a sequestration rate of 0.24 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. In addition, we found climate (Hargreaves climatic moisture deficit) was important in explaining the variation of SOC stocks with cover crops, followed by soil properties (e.g., soil clay content). In terms of management practices, cover crop type had a significant positive (0.36) effect on SOC stocks, with non-legumes showing a greater impact, compared to legumes and mixtures. Crop rotational diversity also had a positive (0.28) effect on SOC accumulation. Our findings suggested that integrating non-legume cover crops into diverse crop rotation is likely to be a promising strategy to maximize SOC stocks with cover crops across North America.",,English,10.1016/j.agee.2023.108599,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22644,2023,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",Elsevier B.V.,,carbon mineralization; carbon sequestration; soil organic matter; climate change mitigation; agricultural research; aggregate stability; boruta analysis; structural equation modeling
Simulation of winter wheat response to variable sowing dates and densities in a high-yielding environment,"Dueri, S.; Brown, H.; Asseng, S.; Ewert, F.; Webber, H.; George, M.; Craigie, R.; Guarin, J.R.; Pequeno, D.N.L.; Stella, T.; Mukhtar Ahmed; Alderman, P.D.; Basso, B.; Berger, A.G.; Bracho-Mujica, G.; Cammarano, D.; Yi Chen; Dumont, B.; Rezaei, E.E.; Fereres, E.; Ferrise, R.; Gaiser, T.; Yujing Gao; Garcia-Vila, M.; Gayler, S.; Hochman, Z.; Hoogenboom, G.; Kersebaum, K.C.; Nendel, C.; Olesen, J.E.; Padovan, G.; Palosuo, T.; Priesack, E.; Pullens, J.W.M.; Rodríguez, A.; Rötter, R.P.; Ruiz Ramos, M.; Semenov, M.A.; Senapati, N.; Siebert, S.; Srivastava, A.K.; Stockle, C.; Supit, I.; Fulu Tao; Thorburn, P.J.; Wang, E.; Weber, T.K.D.; Liujun Xiao; Chuang Zhao; Jin Zhao; Zhigan Zhao; Yan Zhu; Martre, P.","Crop multi-model ensembles (MME) have proven to be effective in increasing the accuracy of simulations in modelling experiments. However, the ability of MME to capture crop responses to changes in sowing dates and densities has not yet been investigated. These management interventions are some of the main levers for adapting cropping systems to climate change. Here, we explore the performance of a MME of 29 wheat crop models to predict the effect of changing sowing dates and rates on yield and yield components, on two sites located in a high-yielding environment in New Zealand. The experiment was conducted for 6 years and provided 50 combinations of sowing date, sowing density and growing season. We show that the MME simulates seasonal growth of wheat well under standard sowing conditions, but fails under early sowing and high sowing rates. The comparison between observed and simulated in-season fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (FIPAR) for early sown wheat shows that the MME does not capture the decrease of crop above ground biomass during winter months due to senescence. Models need to better account for tiller competition for light, nutrients, and water during vegetative growth, and early tiller senescence and tiller mortality, which are exacerbated by early sowing, high sowing densities, and warmer winter temperatures.",,English,10.1093/jxb/erac221,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22643,2022,Journal of Experimental Botany,Oxford University Press,5715-5729,sowing date; tillering; wheat; yield potential; multi-model ensemble; sowing density; tiller mortality
Comprehensive assessment of climate extremes in high-resolution CMIP6 projections for Ethiopia,"Mequanint, F.; Gayler, S.; Weber, T.K.D.; Tesfaye, K.; Streck, T.","Climate extremes have more far-reaching and devastating effects than the mean climate shift, particularly on the most vulnerable societies. Ethiopia, with its low economic adaptive capacity, has been experiencing recurrent climate extremes for an extended period, leading to devastating impacts and acute food shortages affecting millions of people. In face of ongoing climate change, the frequency and intensity of climate extreme events are expected to increase further in the foreseeable future. This study provides an overview of projected changes in climate extremes indices based on downscaled high-resolution (i.e., 10 × 10 km (Formula presented.)) daily climate data derived from global climate models (GCMs). The magnitude and spatial patterns of trends in the projected climate extreme indices were explored under a range of emission scenarios called Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The performance of the GCMs to reproduce the observed climate extreme trends in the base period (1983–2012) was evaluated, the changes in the climate projections (2020–2100) were assessed and the associated uncertainties were quantified. Overall, results show largely significant and spatially consistent trends in the projected temperature-derived extreme indices with acceptable model performance in the base period. The projected changes are dominated by the uncertainties in the GCMs at the beginning of the projection period while by the end of the century proportional uncertainties arise both from the GCMs and SSPs. The results for precipitation-related extreme indices are heterogeneous in terms of spatial distribution, magnitude, and statistical significance coverage. Unlike the temperature-related indices, the uncertainty from internal climate variability constitutes a considerable proportion of the total uncertainty in the projected trends. Our work provides a comprehensive insight into the projected changes in climate extremes at relatively high spatial resolution and the related sources of projection uncertainties.",,English,10.3389/fenvs.2023.1127265,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22627,2023,Frontiers in Environmental Science,Frontiers Media S.A.,,extreme weather events; trends; uncertainty; climate extremes; coupled model intercomparison project; shared socioeconomic pathways
Satellite imagery for high-throughput phenotyping in breeding plots,"Pinto Espinosa, F.; Zaman-Allah, M.; Reynolds, M.P.; Schulthess, U.","Advances in breeding efforts to increase the rate of genetic gains and enhance crop resilience to climate change have been limited by the procedure and costs of phenotyping methods. The recent rapid development of sensors, image-processing technology, and data-analysis has provided opportunities for multiple scales phenotyping methods and systems, including satellite imagery. Among these platforms, satellite imagery may represent one of the ultimate approaches to remotely monitor trials and nurseries planted in multiple locations while standardizing protocols and reducing costs. However, the deployment of satellite-based phenotyping in breeding trials has largely been limited by low spatial resolution of satellite images. The advent of a new generation of high-resolution satellites may finally overcome these limitations. The SkySat constellation started offering multispectral images at a 0.5 m resolution since 2020. In this communication we present a case study on the use of time series SkySat images to estimate NDVI from wheat and maize breeding plots encompassing different sizes and spacing. We evaluated the reliability of the calculated NDVI and tested its capacity to detect seasonal changes and genotypic differences.

Analysis of adoption of conservation agriculture practices in southern Africa: mixed-methods approach,"Tufa, A.H.; Kanyamuka, J.; Alene, A.D.; Ngoma, H.; Marenya, P.P.; Thierfelder, C.; Banda, H.; Chikoye, D.","In southern Africa, conservation agriculture (CA) has been promoted to address low agricultural productivity, food insecurity, and land degradation. However, despite significant experimental evidence on the agronomic and economic benefits of CA and large scale investments by the donor community and national governments, adoption rates among smallholders remain below expectation. The main objective of this research project was thus to investigate why previous efforts and investments to scale CA technologies and practices in southern Africa have not led to widespread adoption. The paper applies a multivariate probit model and other methods to survey data from 4,373 households and 278 focus groups to identify the drivers and barriers of CA adoption in Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The results show that declining soil fertility is a major constraint to maize production in Zambia and Malawi, and drought/heat is more pronounced in Zimbabwe. We also find gaps between (a) awareness and adoption, (b) training and adoption, and (c) demonstration and adoption rates of CA practices in all three countries. The gaps are much bigger between awareness and adoption and much smaller between hosting demonstration and adoption, suggesting that much of the awareness of CA practices has not translated to greater adoption. Training and demonstrations are better conduits to enhance adoption than mere awareness creation. Therefore, demonstrating the applications and benefits of CA practices is critical for promoting CA practices in all countries. Besides, greater adoption of CA practices requires enhancing farmers’ access to inputs, addressing drudgery associated with CA implementation, enhancing farmers’ technical know-how, and enacting and enforcing community bylaws regarding livestock grazing and wildfires. The paper concludes by discussing the implications for policy and investments in CA promotion.",Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad); CGIAR Trust Fund,English,10.3389/fsufs.2023.1151876,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22598,2023,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,Frontiers,,conservation agriculture; climate change; adoption; focus group discussion
The role of crop management practices and adaptation options to minimize the impact of climate change on maize (Zea mays L.) production for Ethiopia,"Feleke, H.G.; Savage, M.J.; Tesfaye, K.; Mequanint, F.","Climate change impact assessment along with adaptation measures are key for reducing the impact of climate change on crop production. The impact of current and future climate change on maize production was investigated, and the adaptation role of shifting planting dates, different levels of nitrogen fertilizer rates, and choice of maize cultivar as possible climate change adaptation strategies were assessed. The study was conducted in three environmentally contrasting sites in Ethiopia, namely: Ambo, Bako, and Melkassa. Future climate data were obtained from seven general circulation models (GCMs), namely: CanESM2, CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-MK3-6-0, EC-EARTH, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-MR, and MIROC5 for the highest representative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5). GCMs were bias-corrected at site level using a quantile-quantile mapping method. APSIM, AquaCrop, and DSSAT crop models were used to simulate the baseline (1995–2017) and 2030s (2021–2050) maize yields. The result indicated that the average monthly maximum air temperature in the 2030s could increase by 0.3–1.7 °C, 0.7–2.2 °C, and 0.8–1.8 °C in Ambo, Bako, and Melkassa, respectively. For the same sites, the projected increase in average monthly minimum air temperature was 0.6–1.7 °C, 0.8–2.3 °C, and 0.6–2.7 °C in that order. While monthly total precipitation for the Kiremt season (June to September) is projected to increase by up to 55% (365 mm) for Ambo and 75% (241 mm) for Bako respectively, whereas a significant decrease in monthly total precipitation is projected for Melkassa by 2030. Climate change would reduce maize yield by an average of 4% and 16% for Ambo and Melkassa respectively, while it would increase by 2% for Bako in 2030 if current maize cultivars were grown with the same crop management practice as the baseline under the future climate. At higher altitudes, early planting of maize cultivars between 15 May and 1 June would result in improved relative yields in the future climate. Fertilizer levels increment between 23 and 150 kg ha−1 would result in progressive improvement of yields for all maize cultivars when combined with early planting for Ambo. For a mid-altitude, planting after 15 May has either no or negative effect on maize yield. Early planting combined with a nitrogen fertilizer level of 23–100 kg ha−1 provided higher relative yields under the future climate. Delayed planting has a negative influence on maize production for Bako under the future climate. For lower altitudes, late planting would have lower relative yields compared to early planting. Higher fertilizer levels (100–150 kg ha−1) would reduce yield reductions under the future climate, but this varied among maize cultivars studied. Generally, the future climate is expected to have a negative impact on maize yield and changes in crop management practices can alleviate the impacts on yield.",,English,10.3390/atmos14030497,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22586,2023,Atmosphere,MDPI,,atmospheric temperature; climate models; crop management; cultivation; grain; nitrogen fertilizers; maize; adaptation options; multimodel ensemble; representative concentration pathway; general circulation models
Role of the interaction space in shaping innovation for sustainable agriculture: Empirical insights from African case studies,"Hermans, T.D.G.; Smith, H.E.; Whitfield, S.; Sallu, S.M.; Recha, J.; Dougill, A.J.; Thierfelder, C.; Gama, M.; Bunderson, W.T.; Museka, R.M.; Doggart, N.; Meshack, C.","The challenges of climate change, food insecurity and land degradation have all led to a push for ‘scaling’ innovation for sustainable agriculture. For this purpose, international agricultural development projects often use farm trials or farmer field schools as a way for farmers to engage with technically-constructed knowledge and empirical evidence. However, the role of such trials in the socio-political construction of knowledge is often overlooked. This study conceptualises agricultural development interventions as taking place within an interaction space between researchers and farmers. Unpacking the processes and dynamics of the interaction space from four case studies across Malawi and mainland Tanzania, we present findings which evaluate: 1) how agricultural innovation takes place in the context of funded agricultural development projects, and 2) how space for technical and social knowledge construction can be opened up or closed down in these contexts. Results show that farm trials provide a basis for interaction, but that knowledge exchange in these contexts also require knowledge brokers for successful implementation and scaling. Both knowledge brokers, and the trials themselves shape social dynamics, often simultaneously facilitating social learning for some, but contributing to social exclusions for others. A strong connection was identified between the design of the interaction space and social dynamics evident within it, indicative of the close interconnection between the processes of socio-political and technical construction of knowledge. Key factors open or close the interaction space, such as the continuity of knowledge brokers and the complexity of technologies. Improving the effectiveness of innovation for sustainable agriculture, requires opening up the interaction space to enable more effective and sustained co-creation of technologies, social learning and the collaborative construction of shared knowledge.",United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH; UK Research and Innovation; CGIAR Trust Fund,English,10.1016/j.jrurstud.2023.103012,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22578,2023,Journal of Rural Studies,Elsevier,,agriculture; agricultural innovation; field experimentation; extension; sustainable agriculture; farm trials
Agroecology can promote climate change adaptation outcomes without compromising yield in smallholder systems,"Dittmer, K.M.; Rose, S.; Snapp, S.S.; Kebede, Y.; Brickman, S.; Shelton, S.; Egler, C.; Stier, M.; Wollenberg, E.","A critical question is whether agroecology can promote climate change mitigation and adaptation outcomes without compromising food security. We assessed the outcomes of smallholder agricultural systems and practices in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) against 35 mitigation, adaptation, and yield indicators by reviewing 50 articles with 77 cases of agroecological treatments relative to a baseline of conventional practices. Crop yields were higher for 63% of cases reporting yields. Crop diversity, income diversity, net income, reduced income variability, nutrient regulation, and reduced pest infestation, indicators of adaptative capacity, were associated with 70% or more of cases. Limited information on climate change mitigation, such as greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration impacts, was available. Overall, the evidence indicates that use of organic nutrient sources, diversifying systems with legumes and integrated pest management lead to climate change adaptation in multiple contexts. Landscape mosaics, biological control (e.g., enhancement of beneficial organisms) and field sanitation measures do not yet have sufficient evidence based on this review. Widespread adoption of agroecological practices and system transformations shows promise to contribute to climate change services and food security in LMICs.

Catching-up with genetic progress: Simulation of potential production for modern wheat cultivars in the Netherlands,"Berghuijs, H.N.C.; Silva, J.V.; Rijk, H.C.A.; Ittersum, M.K. van; van Evert, F.; Reidsma, P.","Context: Wheat crop growth models from all over the world have been calibrated on the Groot and Verberne (1991) data set, collected between 1982 and 1984 in the Netherlands, in at least 28 published studies to date including various recent ones. However, the recent use of this data set for calibration of potential yield is questionable as actual Dutch winter wheat yields increased by 3.1 Mg ha-1 over the period 1984 – 2015. A new comprehensive set of winter wheat experiments, suitable for crop model calibration, was conducted in Wageningen during the growing seasons of 2013–2014 and of 2014–2015. Objective: The present study aimed to quantify the change of winter wheat variety traits between 1984 and 2015 and to examine which of the identified traits explained the increase in wheat yield most. Methods: PCSE-LINTUL3 was calibrated on the Groot and Verberne data (1991) set. Next, it was evaluated on the 2013–2015 data set. The model was further recalibrated on the 2013–2015 data set. Parameter values of both calibrations were compared. Sensitivity analysis was used to assess to what extent climate change, elevated CO2, changes in sowing dates, and changes in cultivar traits could explain yield increases. Results: The estimated reference light use efficiency and the temperature sum from anthesis to maturity were higher in 2013–2015 than in 1982–1984. PCSE-LINTUL3, calibrated on the 1982–1984 data set, underestimated the yield potential of 2013–2015. Sensitivity analyses showed that about half of the simulated winter wheat yield increase between 1984 and 2015 in the Netherlands was explained by elevated CO2 and climate change. The remaining part was explained by the increased temperature sum from anthesis to maturity and, to a smaller extent, by changes in the reference light use efficiency. Changes in sowing dates, biomass partitioning fractions, thermal requirements for anthesis, and biomass reallocation did not explain the yield increase. Conclusion: Recalibration of PCSE-LINTUL3 was necessary to reproduce the high wheat yields currently obtained in the Netherlands. About half of the reported winter wheat yield increase was attributed to climate change and elevated CO2. The remaining part of the increase was attributed to changes in the temperature sum from anthesis to maturity and, to a lesser extent, the reference light use efficiency. Significance: This study systematically addressed to what extent changes in various cultivar traits, climate change, and elevated CO2 can explain the winter wheat yield increase observed in the Netherlands between 1984 and 2015.",Digital Future Farm Project; Water Farming Project; CGIAR Trust Fund,English,10.1016/j.fcr.2023.108891,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22576,2023,Field Crops Research,Elsevier,,crop modelling; light; phenology; maximum sustainable yield; triticum aestivum; winter wheat; light use efficiency; potential yield
Implementing conjunctive management of water resources for irrigation development: A framework applied to the Southern Plain of Western Nepal,"Pandey, V.P.; Shrestha, N.; Urfels, A.; Ray, A.; Khadka, M.; Pavelic, P.; Mcdonald, A.; Krupnik, T.J.","Climate variability and insufficient irrigation are primary constraints to stable and higher agricultural productivity and food security in Nepal. Agriculture is the largest global freshwater user, and integration of surface- and ground-water use is frequently presented as an strategy for increasing efficiency as well as climate change adaptation. However, conjunctive management (CM) planning often ignores demand-side requirements and a broader set of sustainable development considerations, including ecosystem health and economics of different development strategies. While there is generic understanding of conjunctive use, detailed technical knowhow to realize the CM is lacking in Nepal. This article presents a holistic framework through literature reviews, stakeholders consultations and expert interviews for assessing CM and implementation prospects from a systems-level perspective. We demonstrate the framework through a case study in Western Nepal, where climatic variability and a lack of irrigation are key impediments to increased agricultural productivity and sustainable development. Results show that knowledge of water resources availability is good and that of water demand low in the Western Terai. Additional and coordinated investments are required to improve knowledge gaps as well as access to irrigation. There is therefore a need to assess water resources availability, water access, use and productivity, to fill the knowledge gaps in order to pave pathways for CM.

Building resilient maize production systems with stress-adapted varieties: Farmers' priorities in western Kenya,"Marenya, P.P.; Wanyama, R.; Alemu, S.; Woyengo, V.","Maize cropping systems in Kenya, as is true in many other places in Africa, face multiple biotic and abiotic stressors not least climatic ones.

Using data from 1,400 farmers and applying a multi-criteria choice analysis, this study reports on smallholder farmers' relative valuation of stress tolerance traits. The results showed that farmers were willing to pay significant premiums for tolerance to drought, striga, low nitrogen (nitrogen use efficiency) and fall army worm infestation, in that order.

Farmers′ use of climate change adaptation strategies and their impacts on food security in Kenya,"Gebre, G.G.; Yuichiro Amekawa; Fikadu, A.A.; Rahut, D.B.","Climate change threatens the sustainability of food production among farmers in Kenya who depend on rain‐fed agriculture. To minimize the negative impacts of climate change, farmers have sought to adopt different adaptation strategies. This study investigates factors influencing farmers’ choice of climate change adaptation strategies and associated effects on their food security in Kenya using data collected from 540 farmers from six counties. A multivariate probit, censored least absolute deviation (CLAD), and propensity score matching (PSM) models were employed to identify the determinants in the farmers’ choice of climate change adaptation strategies, the number of adaptation strategies adopted, and the effect of climate change adaptation strategies on their food security, respectively. Results show that planting drought-tolerant crop varieties (55%), growing diversified crops (34%), growing early maturing crops (22%), and diversifying the sources of household income (18%) were the four major adaptation strategies used by the farmers in the study area. Younger farmers and those with higher education levels are more likely to use these climate change adaptation practices. The number of adaptation strategies used was positively associated with male farmers, education level, family size, land size, farm income, extension contact, training, and information access. The farmers who adopt one adaptation strategy have higher food security status (approximately 7–11%) than those who do not. If they adopt two adaptation strategies, their food security status increases by approximately 11–14%; if they adopt three adaptation strategies, their food security status increases by nearly 12–15%; and if they adopt four adaptation practices, their food security status increases by about 14–18%, compared to those who do not adopt any strategy. Thus, the farmers’ climate change adaptation practices have positive food security effects in Kenya according to the number of adaptation strategies adopted.",,English,10.1016/j.crm.2023.100495,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22548,2023,Climate Risk Management,Elsevier,,climate change; food security; smallholders; adaptation strategies; smallholder farmers
Climate-smart agriculture technologies and determinants of farmers’ adoption decisions in the Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia,"Sisay, T.; Tesfaye, K.; Ketema, M.; Nigussie Dechassa; Getnet, M.","Agriculture is a sector that is very vulnerable to the effects of climate change while contributing to anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. Therefore, applying Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) technologies and practices (referee hereafter as CSA technologies) that can sustainably boost productivity, improve resilience, and lower GHG emissions are crucial for a climate resilient agriculture. This study sought to identify the CSA technologies used by farmers and assess adoption levels and factors that influence them. A cross-sectional survey was carried out gather information from 384 smallholder farmers in the Great Rift Valley (GRV) of Ethiopia. Data were analyzed using percentage, chi-square test, t test, and the multivariate probit model. Results showed that crop diversification, agroforestry, and integrated soil fertility management were the most widely practiced technologies. The results of the chi-square and t tests showed that there are differences and significant and positive connections between adopters and non-adopters based on various attributes. The chi-square and t test results confirmed that households who were older and who had higher incomes, greater credit access, climate information access, better training, better education, larger farms, higher incomes, and more frequent interactions with extension specialists had positive and significant associations with CSA technology adopters. The model result showed that age, sex, and education of the head; farmland size; livestock ownership; income; access to credit; access to climate information; training; and extension contact influenced the adoption of CSA technologies.

Guard-cell-targeted overexpression of Arabidopsis Hexokinase 1 can improve water use efficiency in field-grown tobacco plants,"Acevedo-Siaca, L.G.; Głowacka, K.; Driever, S.M.; Salesse-Smith, C.; Lugassi, N.; Granot, D.; Long, S.P.; Kromdijk, J.","Water deficit currently acts as one of the largest limiting factors for agricultural productivity worldwide. Additionally, limitation by water scarcity is projected to continue in the future with the further onset of effects of global climate change. As a result, it is critical to develop or breed for crops that have increased water use efficiency and that are more capable of coping with water scarce conditions. However, increased intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) typically brings a trade-off with CO2 assimilation as all gas exchange is mediated by stomata, through which CO2 enters the leaf while water vapor exits. Previously, promising results were shown using guard-cell-targeted overexpression of hexokinase to increase iWUE without incurring a penalty in photosynthetic rates or biomass production. Here, two homozygous transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) lines expressing Arabidopsis Hexokinase 1 (AtHXK1) constitutively (35SHXK2 and 35SHXK5) and a line that had guard-cell-targeted overexpression of AtHXK1 (GCHXK2) were evaluated relative to wild type for traits related to photosynthesis and yield. In this study, iWUE was significantly higher in GCHXK2 compared with wild type without negatively impacting CO2 assimilation, although results were dependent upon leaf age and proximity of precipitation event to gas exchange measurement.",,English,10.1093/jxb/erac218,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22544,2022,Journal of Experimental Botany,Oxford University Press,5745-5757,carbon dioxide; hexokinase; photosynthesis; water use efficiency; co2 assimilation
"Biofortification to avoid malnutrition in humans in a changing climate: Enhancing micronutrient bioavailability in seed, tuber, and storage roots","Dwivedi, S.; Garcia-Oliveira, A.L.; Govindaraj, M.; Ortiz, R.","Malnutrition results in enormous socio-economic costs to the individual, their community, and the nation’s economy. The evidence suggests an overall negative impact of climate change on the agricultural productivity and nutritional quality of food crops.

Approximately 4.6 million households currently cultivate Zn-rich rice and wheat, while ~3 million households in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America benefit from Fe-rich beans, and 2.6 million people in sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil eat provitamin A-rich cassava. Furthermore, nutrient profiles can be improved through genetic engineering in an agronomically acceptable genetic background. The development of “Golden Rice” and provitamin A-rich dessert bananas and subsequent transfer of this trait into locally adapted cultivars are evident, with no significant change in nutritional profile, except for the trait incorporated. A greater understanding of nutrient transport and absorption may lead to the development of diet therapy for the betterment of human health.",CGIAR Trust Fund,English,10.3389/fpls.2023.1119148,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22491,2023,Frontiers in Plant Science,Frontiers,,bioavailability; absorption; climate change; genetic markers; genetic engineering; nutrients; transport; storage; bioaccessibility and absorption; biofortified crop cultivars; genes and genetic markers; nutrient acquisition; transport and storage
Global crop yields can be lifted by timely adaptation of growing periods to climate change,"Minoli, S.; Jägermeyr, J.; Asseng, S.; Urfels, A.; Muller, C.","Adaptive management of crop growing periods by adjusting sowing dates and cultivars is one of the central aspects of crop production systems, tightly connected to local climate. However, it is so far underrepresented in crop-model based assessments of yields under climate change. In this study, we integrate models of farmers’ decision making with biophysical crop modeling at the global scale to simulate crop calendars adaptation and its effect on crop yields of maize, rice, sorghum, soybean and wheat. We simulate crop growing periods and yields (1986-2099) under counterfactual management scenarios assuming no adaptation, timely adaptation or delayed adaptation of sowing dates and cultivars. We then compare the counterfactual growing periods and corresponding yields at the end of the century (2080-2099). We find that (i) with adaptation, temperature-driven sowing dates (typical at latitudes >30°N-S) will have larger shifts than precipitation-driven sowing dates (at latitudes <30°N-S); (ii) later-maturing cultivars will be needed, particularly at higher latitudes; (iii) timely adaptation of growing periods would increase actual crop yields by ~12%, reducing climate change negative impacts and enhancing the positive CO2 fertilization effect.

Conservation agriculture affects grain and nutrient yields of maize (Zea Mays L.) and can impact food and nutrition security in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Galani, Y.J.H.; Ivy Sichinga Ligowe; Kieffer, M.; Kamalongo, D.; Kambwiri, A.M.; Kuwali, P.; Thierfelder, C.; Dougill, A.J.; Gong, Y.Y.; Orfila, C.","Maize is a major staple and plays an essential role in food and nutrition security in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Conservation agriculture (CA), a climate-smart agriculture practise based on minimum soil disturbance, crop residue retention, and crop diversification, has been widely advocated but without extensive research on the impact it may have on maize nutrient composition, and food and nutrition security. This study assessed the grain yield, macro- and micronutrient mineral content, and nutrient yield of eight maize varieties grown in Malawi, and how these are affected by CA practises over two seasons. The minerals were analysed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) coupled to optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and to mass spectroscopy (MS). Grain yield and Se content differed among the varieties, while C, N, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, P, and Zn were similar. The local variety Kanjerenjere showed lowest grain and nutrient yields. The open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) concentrated more minerals than the F1 hybrids, but the latter showed higher yields for both grain and nutrients. Typical consumption of the eight maize varieties could fully meet the protein and Mg dietary reference intake (DRIs) of Malawian children (1–3 years), as well as Mg and Mn needs of adult women (19–50 years), but their contribution to dietary requirements was low for Fe (39–41%) and K (13–21%). The trials showed that CA increased grain yield (1.2- to 1.8-fold) and Se content (1.1- to 1.7-fold), but that it had no effect on C, K, Mg, P, and Zn, and that N (1.1- to 1.2-fold), Mn (1.1- to 1.8-fold), and Fe (1.3- to 3.4-fold) were reduced. The high increase in grain yield under CA treatments resulted in increased yields of protein and Se, no effect on the yields of K, Mg, Mn, P, Zn, and reduced Fe yield. Conservation agriculture could contribute in reducing the risk of Se deficiency in Malawian women and children but exacerbates the risk of Fe deficiency. A combination of strategies will be needed to mitigate some of the foreseen effects of climate change on agriculture, and food and nutrition security, and improve nutrient intake.",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); CGIAR Trust Fund,English,10.3389/fnut.2021.804663,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22423,2022,Frontiers in Nutrition,Frontiers,,maize; varieties; nutrition security; nutrient deficiencies; climate change; maize varieties; micronutrient deficiencies

For staple cereal production in India, Ethiopia, and Malawi, our estimates of N-fertilizer savings show the value of integrated organic and inorganic N management. N-deficient systems benefit from shifting to more cost-effective, high-N fertilizer (such as urea), combined with compost and legumes. N-surplus systems achieve N savings through better targeted and more efficient N-fertilizer use. Globally, there is a need to re-balance access to N-fertilizers, while steering the right fertilizer to the right place, and managing N in combination with carbon through near-term interventions, while striving for longer-term sustainable management.

Smallholder farms have and can store more carbon than previously estimated,"Ewing, P.M.; Tu, X.; Runck, B.C.; Nord, A.; Chikowo, R.; Snapp, S.S.","Increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is increasingly targeted as a key strategy in climate change mitigation and improved ecosystem resiliency. Agricultural land, a dominant global land use, provides substantial challenges and opportunities for global carbon sequestration. Despite this, global estimates of soil carbon sequestration potential often exclude agricultural land and estimates are coarse for regions in the Global South. To address these discrepancies and improve estimates, we develop a hybrid, data-augmented database approach to better estimate the magnitude of SOC sequestration potential of agricultural soils. With high-resolution (30 m) soil maps of Africa developed by the International Soils Database (iSDA) and Malawi as a case study, we create a national adjustment using site-specific soil data retrieved from 1160 agricultural fields. We use a benchmark approach to estimate the amount of SOC Malawian agricultural soils can sequester, accounting for edaphic and climatic conditions, and calculate the resulting carbon gap. Field measurements of SOC stocks and sequestration potentials were consistently larger than iSDA predictions, with an average carbon gap of 4.42 ± 0.23 Mg C ha−1 to a depth of 20 cm, with some areas exceeding 10 Mg C ha−1. Augmenting iSDA predictions with field data also improved sensitivity to identify areas with high SOC sequestration potential by 6%—areas that may benefit from improved management practices. Overall, we estimate that 6.8 million ha of surface soil suitable for agriculture in Malawi has the potential to store 274 ± 14 Tg SOC. Our approach illustrates how ground truthing efforts remain essential to reduce errors in continent-wide soil carbon predictions for local and regional use. This work begins efforts needed across regions to develop soil carbon benchmarks that inform policies and identify high-impact areas in the effort to increase SOC globally.",,English,10.1111/gcb.16551,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22410,2023,Global Change Biology,Wiley,1471-1483,carbon sequestration; climate change mitigation; smallholders; carbon; geographically weighted regression; international soils database; smallholder agriculture; soil carbon
Scalable diversification options delivers sustainable and nutritious food in Indo-Gangetic plains,"Gora, M.K.; Satish Kumar; Jat, H.S.; Kakraliya Suresh Kumar; Choudhary, M.; Dhaka, A.K.; Jat, R.D.; Kakraliya, M.; Sharma, P.C.; Jat, M.L.","Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) of South Asia have supported bulk of human and bovine population in the region since ages, and a spectacular progress has been made in food production. However, malnutrition, diminishing total factor productivity, and natural resource degradation continue to plague this cereal-dominated region, which is also vulnerable to climate change. Addressing these challenges would require a transition towards diversifying cereal rotations with agroecological cropping systems. A study was, therefore, conducted at the experimental farm of ICAR-CSSRI, Karnal on crop diversification and sustainable intensification options using agro-ecological approaches such as Conservation Agriculture (CA) and diversified cropping systems to ensure food and nutritional security while sustaining the natural resources. On 2 years mean basis, CA-based cropping system management scenarios (mean of Sc2–Sc7) using diversified crop rotations; increased the system yield by 15.4%, net return by 28.7%, protein yield by 29.7%, while using 53.0% less irrigation water compared to conventional tillage (CT)-based rice–wheat system (Sc1). Maize-mustard-mungbean on permanent beds (PBs) (Sc4) recorded the highest productivity (+ 40.7%), profitability (+ 60.1%), and saved 81.8% irrigation water compared to Sc1 (11.8 Mg ha−1; 2190 USD ha−1; 2514 mm ha−1). Similarly, Sc5 (maize-wheat-mungbean on PBs) improved productivity (+ 32.2%), profitability (+ 57.4%) and saved irrigation water (75.5%) compared to Sc1. In terms of nutritional value, Sc5 was more balanced than other scenarios, and produced 43.8, 27.5 and 259.8% higher protein, carbohydrate and fat yields, respectively, compared to Sc1 (0.93, 8.55 and 0.14 Mg ha−1). Scenario 5 was able to meet the nutrient demand of 19, 23 and 32 additional persons ha−1 year−1 with respect to protein, carbohydrate and fat, respectively, compared to Sc1.

Integration of short duration legume (mungbean) improved the system productivity by 17.2% and profitability by 32.1%, while triple gains in irrigation water productivity compared to CT-based systems. In western IGP, maize-wheat-mungbean on PBs was found most productive, profitable and nutritionally rich and efficient system compared to other systems.

"Carbon sequestration potential, challenges, and strategies towards climate action in smallholder agricultural systems of South Asia","Jat, M.L.; Chakraborty, D.; Ladha, J.; Parihar, C.M.; Datta, A.; Mandal, B.; Nayak, H.S.; Maity, P.; Dharamvir Singh Rana; Chaudhari, S.K.; Gerard, B.","South Asia is a global hotspot for climate change with enormous pressure on land and water resources for feeding the burgeoning population. The agricultural production systems are highly vulnerable in the region and is primarily dominated by small and marginal farmers with intensive farming practices that had favored the loss of carbon (C) from soil. This review discusses the potential of soil and crop management practices such as minimum/reduced/no-tillage, use of organic manure, balanced and integrated plant nutrient application, precision land levelling, precision water and pest management, residue management, and cropping system optimization to maintain the C-equilibrium between soil and atmosphere and to enhance the C-sequestration in the long run. Results of meta-analysis show a potential 36% increase in soil organic C stock in the top 0–15 cm layer in this region which amounts to ∼18 Mg C stocks ha−1. Improved management practices across crops and environment may reduce methane em0ission by 12% resulting in an 8% reduction in global warming potential (GWP), while non-submerged condition led to a 51% GWP reduction in rice. Conservation agriculture and precision fertilization also reduced GWP by 11 and 14%, respectively. Although several innovative climate resilient technologies having significant potential for C-sequestration have been developed, there is an urgent need for their scaling and accelerated adoption to increase soil C-sequestration. Policies and programs need to be devised for incentivizing farmers to adopt more C-neutral or C-positive agricultural practices. The national governments and other agencies should work towards C farming together with global initiatives such as the “4 per 1000” Initiative and Global Soil Partnership, and regional public-private partnership initiatives on carbon credits for Regenerative Agriculture such as by Grow Indigo-CIMMYT-ICAR in India, in addition to research and policy changes.

simulate rice yield (cultivar PR 114) under different nitrogen levels and planting dates using DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) for
Sitamarhi district, Bihar, India. Results showed that the late planting of rice predicted the highest yield (3800 kg ha-1) with high variability under SCF (wet) and

Prediction of near-term climate change impacts on UK wheat quality and the potential for adaptation through plant breeding,"Fradgley, N.; Bacon, J.; Bentley, A.R.; Costa-Neto, G.; Cottrell, A.; Crossa, J.; Cuevas, J.; Kerton, M.; Pope, E.; Swarbreck, S.M.; Gardner, K.A.","Wheat is a major crop worldwide, mainly cultivated for human consumption and animal feed. Grain quality is paramount in determining its value and downstream use. While we know that climate change threatens global crop yields, a better understanding of impacts on wheat end-use quality is also critical. Combining quantitative genetics with climate model outputs, we investigated UK-wide trends in genotypic adaptation for wheat quality traits. In our approach, we augmented genomic prediction models with environmental characterisation of field trials to predict trait values and climate effects in historical field trial data between 2001 and 2020. Addition of environmental covariates, such as temperature and rainfall, successfully enabled prediction of genotype by environment interactions (G × E), and increased prediction accuracy of most traits for new genotypes in new year cross validation. We then extended predictions from these models to much larger numbers of simulated environments using climate scenarios projected under Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 for 2050–2069. We found geographically varying climate change impacts on wheat quality due to contrasting associations between specific weather covariables and quality traits across the UK. Notably, negative impacts on quality traits were predicted in the East of the UK due to increased summer temperatures while the climate in the North and South-west may become more favourable with increased summer temperatures. Furthermore, by projecting 167,040 simulated future genotype–environment combinations, we found only limited potential for breeding to exploit predictable G × E to mitigate year-to-year environmental variability for most traits except Hagberg falling number. This suggests low adaptability of current UK wheat germplasm across future UK climates. More generally, approaches demonstrated here will be critical to enable adaptation of global crops to near-term climate change.","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); CGIAR Trust Fund; Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, United Kingdom; British Society of Plant Breeders Limited",English,10.1111/gcb.16552,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22384,2023,Global Change Biology,Wiley,1296-1313,adaptation; climate change; grain; quality; wheat; breeding; climate change impact; genomic prediction; grain quality; wheat breeding
"Planting rice at monsoon onset could mitigate the impact of temperature stress on rice–wheat systems of Bihar, India","Montes, C.; Urfels, A.; Eunjin Han; Singh, B.","The rice–wheat rotation is the dominant cropping system in Bihar, where food security of the rural population depends heavily on the production of rice and wheat. In Bihar, farmers plant rice after the first significant rains, and climatic shocks induced by low temperatures and terminal heat stress at the end of the corresponding season can significantly affect rice and wheat yields. The present work evaluates the benefit of using an earlier date for planting rice, following the monsoon onset, in reducing thermal stress on rice–wheat systems. High-resolution gridded crop simulations using the APSIM model were performed to simulate potential yields using the monsoon onset and the farmers’ practice as planting dates. The monsoon onset was calculated using an agronomic definition, and farmers’ practice dates were estimated using satellite data. The results were analyzed in terms of planting dates, yields, and the incidence of temperature stress on rice and wheat by means of the APSIM yields limiting factors. The results show that the rice planting and harvest dates using the monsoon onset are, in general, 20–30 days earlier, which translates into higher and more stable potential yields, which can be up to 50% higher in wheat and 29% in rice. The incidence of thermal stress can be, on average, 12% lower in rice and 25% in wheat. These results can help design mitigation strategies for the impacts of temperature-induced shock events in the context of the advances in sub-seasonal and seasonal forecasting, targeting climate services for farmers in Bihar.","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)",English,10.3390/atmos14010040,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22371,2023,Atmosphere,MDPI,,rice; wheat; monsoons; wet season; crop modelling; climate change adaptation; rainy season; timesat; apsim; agricultural production systems simulator; climate adaptation
Genomic selection: A tool for accelerating the efficiency of molecular breeding for development of climate-resilient crops,"Neeraj Budhlakoti; Kushwaha, A.K.; Rai, A.; Chaturvedi, K.K.; Kumar, A.; Pradhan, A.K.; Kumar, U.; Rajeev Kumar; Juliana, P.; Mishra, D.C.; Kumar, S.","Since the inception of the theory and conceptual framework of genomic selection (GS), extensive research has been done on evaluating its efficiency for utilization in crop improvement. Though, the marker-assisted selection has proven its potential for improvement of qualitative traits controlled by one to few genes with large effects. Its role in improving quantitative traits controlled by several genes with small effects is limited. In this regard, GS that utilizes genomic-estimated breeding values of individuals obtained from genome-wide markers to choose candidates for the next breeding cycle is a powerful approach to improve quantitative traits. In the last two decades, GS has been widely adopted in animal breeding programs globally because of its potential to improve selection accuracy, minimize phenotyping, reduce cycle time, and increase genetic gains. In addition, given the promising initial evaluation outcomes of GS for the improvement of yield, biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, and quality in cereal crops like wheat, maize, and rice, prospects of integrating it in breeding crops are also being explored. Improved statistical models that leverage the genomic information to increase the prediction accuracies are critical for the effectiveness of GS-enabled breeding programs. Study on genetic architecture under drought and heat stress helps in developing production markers that can significantly accelerate the development of stress-resilient crop varieties through GS.

Envirome-wide associations enhance multi-year genome-based prediction of historical wheat breeding data,"Costa-Neto, G.; Crespo Herrera, L.A.; Fradgley, N.; Gardner, K.A.; Bentley, A.R.; Dreisigacker, S.; Fritsche-Neto, R.; Montesinos-Lopez, O.A.; Crossa, J.","Linking high-throughput environmental data (enviromics) to genomic prediction (GP) is a cost-effective strategy for increasing selection intensity under genotype-by-environment interactions (G × E). This study developed a data-driven approach based on Environment-Phenotype Associations (EPA) aimed at recycling important G × E information from historical breeding data. EPA was developed in two applications: (1) scanning a secondary source of genetic variation, weighted from the shared reaction-norms of past-evaluated genotypes; (2) pinpointing weights of the similarity among trial-sites (locations), given the historical impact of each envirotyping data variable for a given site. These results were then used as a dimensionality reduction strategy, integrating historical data to feed multi-environment GP models, which led to development of four new G × E kernels considering genomics, enviromics and EPA outcomes. The wheat trial data used included 36 locations, eight years and three target populations of environments (TPE) in India. Four prediction scenarios and six kernel-models within/across TPEs were tested. Our results suggest that the conventional GBLUP, without enviromic data or when omitting EPA, is inefficient in predicting the performance of wheat lines in future years. Nevertheless, when EPA was introduced as an intermediary learning step to reduce the dimensionality of the G × E kernels while connecting phenotypic and environmental-wide variation, a significant enhancement of G × E prediction accuracy was evident. EPA revealed that the effect of seasonality makes strategies such as “covariable selection” unfeasible because G × E is year-germplasm specific. We propose that the EPA effectively serves as a “reinforcement learner” algorithm capable of uncovering the effect of seasonality over the reaction-norms, with the benefits of better forecasting the similarities between past and future trialing sites.

One of the most climate-vulnerable nations in the eastern and central Indo-Gangetic Basin is Bangladesh. There have been numerous studies on the effects of climate change in Bangladesh; however, most of them tended to just look at a small fraction of the impact elements or were climatic projections without accounting for the effects on agriculture. Additionally, simulation studies using the CERES-Rice and CERES-Wheat models were conducted for rice and wheat to evaluate the effects of climate change on Bangladeshi agriculture. However, up to now, Bangladesh has not implemented farming system ideas by integrating cropping systems with other income-generating activities. This study was conducted as part of the Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) regional evaluations using the protocols and integrated assessment processes of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP).

To assist policymakers in creating national and regional plans for anticipated future agricultural systems, our work on the integrated evaluation of climate change impacts on agricultural systems produced realistic predictions. The outcome of this research prescribes a holistic assessment of climate change on future production systems by including all the relevant enterprises in the agriculture sector. The findings of the study suggested two major strategies to minimize the yield and increase the profitability in a rice–wheat cropping system. Using a short-term HYV (High Yielding Variety) of rice can shift the sowing time of wheat by 7 days in advance compared to the traditional sowing days of mid-November.

Climate-change-induced temporal variation in precipitation increases nitrogen losses from intensive cropping systems: Analysis with a toy model,"Vitousek, P.M.; Xinping Chen; Cui, Z.; Liu, X.; Matson, P.A.; Ortiz-Monasterio, I.; Robertson, G.; Fusuo Zhang","A simple ‘toy’ model of productivity and nitrogen and phosphorus cycling was used to evaluate how the increasing temporal variation in precipitation that is predicted (and observed) to occur as a consequence of greenhouse-gas-induced climate change will affect crop yields and losses of reactive N that can cause environmental damage and affect human health. The model predicted that as temporal variability in precipitation increased it progressively reduced yields and increased losses of reactive N by disrupting the synchrony between N supply and plant N uptake. Also, increases in the temporal variation of precipitation increased the frequency of floods and droughts. Predictions of this model indicate that climate-change-driven increases in temporal variation in precipitation in rainfed agricultural ecosystems will make it difficult to sustain cropping systems that are both high-yielding and have small environmental and human-health footprints.",,English,10.15302/J-FASE-2022452,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22318,2022,Frontiers of Agricultural Science and Engineering,Higher Education Press,457-464,crop yield; fertilizers; nitrogen; cropping systems; fertilizer timing; nitrogen loss; precipitation variability; toy model
"Mapping the spatial distribution of underutilised crop species under climate change using the MaxEnt model: A case of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa","Mugiyo, H.; Chimonyo, V.G.P.; Kunz, R.; Sibanda, M.; Nhamo, L.; Ramakgahlele Masemolaaf, C.; Modi, A.T.; Mabhaudhi, T.","Knowing the spatial and temporal suitability of neglected and underutilised crop species (NUS) is important for fitting them into marginal production areas and cropping systems under climate change. The current study used climate change scenarios to map the future distribution of selected NUS, namely, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), amaranth (Amaranthus) and taro (Colocasia esculenta) in the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, South Africa. The future distribution of NUS was simulated using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model using regional circulation models (RCMs) from the CORDEX archive, each driven by a different global circulation model (GCM), for the years 2030 to 2070. The study showed an increase of 0.1–11.8% under highly suitable (S1), moderately suitable (S2), and marginally suitable (S3) for sorghum, cowpea, and amaranth growing areas from 2030 to 2070 across all RCPs. In contrast, the total highly suitable area for taro production is projected to decrease by 0.3–9.78% across all RCPs. The jack-knife tests of the MaxEnt model performed efficiently, with areas under the curve being more significant than 0.8. The study identified annual precipitation, length of the growing period, and minimum and maximum temperature as variables contributing significantly to model predictions. The developed maps indicate possible changes in the future suitability of NUS within the KZN province. Understanding the future distribution of NUS is useful for developing transformative climate change adaptation strategies that consider future crop distribution. It is recommended to develop regionally differentiated climate-smart agriculture production guidelines matched to spatial and temporal variability in crop suitability.",,English,10.1016/j.cliser.2022.100330,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22316,2022,Climate Services,Elsevier,,food security; nutrition security; land suitability; machine learning; food and nutrition security; land suitability analysis; machine learning algorithms; underutilized crop species
The impact of 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C global warming on global maize production and trade,"Li, K.; Jie Pan; Wei Xiong; Wei Xie; Tariq Ali","Climate change is becoming more and more remarkable which has an obvious impact on crop yields all over the world. Future climate scenario data was simulated by 5 climate models recommended by ISI-MIP under 4 RCP scenarios, in which the approximate scenarios with global warming by 1.5 °C and 2 °C were selected. Applying DSSAT and GTAP models, the per unit yield changes of maize in the world under global warming by 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C were analyzed and the market prices of maize at national and global levels were simulated. The results showed that, the risk of maize yield reduction under 2.0 °C scenario was much more serious than 1.5 °C scenario; the ratios of yield changes were separately 0.18% and − 10.8% under 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C scenarios. The reduction trend of total maize production is obvious in the top five countries and the main producing regions of the world, especially under the 2.0 °C scenario. The market price of maize would increase by around 0.7% and 3.4% under 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C scenarios. With the quickly increasing population in the world, it is urgent for all countries to pay enough attention to the risk of maize yield and take actions of mitigation and adaptation to climate change.",,English,10.1038/s41598-022-22228-7,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22311,2022,Scientific Reports,Nature Publishing Group,,climate change; greenhouse effect; maize; mitigation; simulation; acclimatization; adaptation; global warming; future climate scenario data; yield reduction risk
Optimal production areas of underutilized indigenous crops and their role under climate change: Focus on Bambara groundnut,"Nhamo, L.; Paterson.

With the advances in agronomy and breeding, commercial crops like maize (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) in the region are under threat from climate change, decreasing rainfall and degraded lands. Unlike commercial crops that are generally adapted from other regions, underutilized indigenous crops are uniquely suited to local environments and are more resilient to climatic variations and tolerant to local pests and diseases. This study, done in Limpopo Province, South Africa, identifies optimal areas for cultivating Bambara groundnuts (Vigna subterannea), an indigenous crop suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The aim is to promote the production of underutilized indigenous crops at a large scale with fewer resources, while still meeting local demand and reducing the food import budget. Suitability maps are delineated using a multicriteria decision method in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The procedure is important for diversifying farming systems, making them more resilient (to biotic and abiotic stresses and climate change) and more successful at enhancing water, food and nutritional security. With the province's limited water and land resources for agriculture expansion, promoting indigenous underutilized crops is a pathway to reduce water allocated to agriculture, thereby enhancing drought resilience and ensuring water, food and nutritional security. Large tracts of degraded agricultural land deemed unsuitable for adapted crops, and which may require costly land reclamation practices, can be used to cultivate underutilized crops that are adapted to extreme local conditions.",,English,10.3389/fsufs.2022.990213,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22306,2022,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,Frontiers,,adaptation; climate change; dry lands; food security; water security; geographical information systems; resilience; food and water security; dryland agriculture

The importance of wheat for food security was recognised by the Chief Agricultural Scientists of the G20 group of countries when they endorsed the establishment of the Wheat Initiative in 2011. The Wheat Initiative was tasked with supporting the wheat research community by facilitating collaboration, information and resource sharing and helping to build the capacity to address challenges facing production in an increasingly variable environment. Many countries invest in wheat research. Innovations in wheat breeding and agronomy have delivered enormous gains over the past few decades, with the average global yield increasing from just over 1 tonne per hectare in the early 1960s to around 3.5 tonnes in the past decade. These gains are threatened by climate change, the rapidly rising financial and environmental costs of fertilizer, and pesticides, combined with declines in water availability for irrigation in many regions.

The disease decimates the maize crop, in some cases, causing total crop failure with far-reaching impacts on regional food security. Results: In this review, we analyze the impacts of MLN in Africa, finding that resource-poor farmers and consumers are the most vulnerable populations. We examine the molecular mechanism of MLN virus transmission, role of vectors and host plant resistance identifying a range of potential opportunities for genetic and phytosanitary interventions to control MLN. We discuss the likely exacerbating effects of climate change on the MLN menace and describe a sobering example of negative genetic association between tolerance to heat/drought and susceptibility to viral infection. We also review role of microRNAs in host plant response to MLN causing viruses as well as heat/drought stress that can be carefully engineered to develop resistant varieties using novel molecular techniques. Conclusions: With the dual drivers of increased crop loss due to MLN and increased demand of maize for food, the development and deployment of simple and safe technologies, like resistant cultivars developed through accelerated breeding or emerging gene editing technologies, will have substantial positive impact on livelihoods in the region. We have summarized the available genetic resources and identified a few large-effect QTLs that can be further exploited to accelerate conversion of existing farmer-preferred varieties into resistant cultivars.",CGIAR Research Program on Maize; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF),English,10.1186/s12870-022-03932-y,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22293,2022,BMC Plant Biology,BioMed Central,,drought stress; gene editing; maize; necrosis; potyvirus; quantitative trait loci; maize chlorotic mottle virus; sugarcane mosaic virus; maize lethal necrosis
Mining alleles for tar spot complex resistance from CIMMYT's maize Germplasm Bank,"Willcox, M.; Burgueño, J.; Jeffers, D.P.; Rodriguez-Chanona, E.; Guadarrama, A.; Kehel, Z.; Chepetla, D.; Shrestha, R.; Swarts, K.; Buckler, E.; Hearne, S.; Charles Chen","The tar spot complex (TSC) is a devastating disease of maize (Zea mays L.), occurring in 17 countries throughout Central, South, and North America and the Caribbean, and can cause grain yield losses of up to 80%. As yield losses from the disease continue to intensify in Central America, Phyllachora maydis, one of the causal pathogens of TSC, was first detected in the United States in 2015, and in 2020 in Ontario, Canada. Both the distribution and yield losses due to TSC are increasing, and there is a critical need to identify the genetic resources for TSC resistance. The Seeds of Discovery Initiative at CIMMYT has sought to combine next-generation sequencing technologies and phenotypic characterization to identify valuable alleles held in the CIMMYT Germplasm Bank for use in germplasm improvement programs. Individual landrace accessions of the “Breeders' Core Collection” were crossed to CIMMYT hybrids to form 918 unique accessions topcrosses (F1 families) which were evaluated during 2011 and 2012 for TSC disease reaction. A total of 16 associated SNP variants were identified for TSC foliar leaf damage resistance and increased grain yield. These variants were confirmed by evaluating the TSC reaction of previously untested selections of the larger F1 testcross population (4,471 accessions) based on the presence of identified favorable SNPs. We demonstrated the usefulness of mining for donor alleles in Germplasm Bank accessions for newly emerging diseases using genomic variation in landraces.","Secretaría de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural, Mexico (SADER); CGIAR Trust Fund; CGIAR Research Program on Maize; National Science Foundation; United States Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS); Oklahoma Agriculture Experimental Station",English,10.3389/fsufs.2022.937200,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22282,2022,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,Frontiers,,maize; landraces; genetic resources; alleles; foliar diseases; climate change; maize landraces; maize genetic resources; allelic diversity; rare alleles; phenotypic characterization; tropical maize; phyllachora maydis
Variable climate suitability for wheat blast (Magnaporthe oryzae pathotype Triticum) in Asia: results from a continental-scale modeling approach,"Montes, C.; Hussain,  S.G.; Krupnik, T.J.","Crop fungal diseases constitute a major cause of yield loss. The development of crop disease monitoring and forecasting tools is an important effort to aid farmers in adapting to climate variability and change. Recognizing weather as a main driver of fungal disease outbreaks, this work assesses the climate suitability for wheat blast (Magnaporthe oryzae pathotype Triticum, MoT) development in Asian wheat-producing countries. MoT was reported for the first time in Bangladesh in 2016 and could spread to other countries, provided that environmental conditions are suitable to spore development, distribution, and infection. With results from a generic infection model driven by air temperature and humidity, and motivated by the necessity to assess the potential distribution of MoT based on the response to weather drivers only, we quantify potential MoT infection events across Asia for the period 1980–2019. The results show a potential higher incidence of MoT in Bangladesh, Myanmar, and some areas of India, where the number of potential infection (NPI) events averaged up to 15 during wheat heading. Interannual trends show an increase in NPI over those three countries, which in turns show their higher interannual variability. Cold/dry conditions in countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan appear to render them unlikely candidates for MoT establishment. The relationship between seasonal climate anomalies and NPI suggests a greater association with relative humidity than with temperature. These results could help to focus future efforts to develop management strategies where weather conditions are conducive for the establishment of MoT.","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)",English,10.1007/s00484-022-02352-9,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22258,2022,International Journal of Biometeorology,Springer,2237–2249,climate services; crop losses; fungal diseases; wheat; climate change; crop damage; fungal disease; infection model; early warning
Sowing the wheat seeds of Afghanistan's future,"Poole, N.; Sharma, R.; Nemat, O.A.; Trenchard, R.; Scanlon, A.; Davy, C.; Ataei, N.; Donovan, J.; Bentley, A.R.","Afghanistan is a country with diverse natural ecologies in a largely arid and mountainous region. The rural sector is still considered to drive economic potential. Current social, political and economic instability along with climatic challenges are driving food and water insecurity in the wider region. In the short term, it is likely that this and the associated challenges of displacement and unemployment can only be addressed by humanitarian intervention and agrifood and nutrition support. In the medium to long term, drought, and heat, probably linked to climate change, will pose recurrent challenges for agriculture and food security that will require a much broader set of interventions to secure the rural population's livelihoods. The genetic gap, among other major challenges, must be addressed if Afghanistan is to develop its agricultural potential leading to income and livelihood improvements for farmers and stable and accessible supplies for consumers. Only thereby will the country be enabled to reap the important and long-sought trade and food security benefits derived from self-sufficiency.

Genotyping by sequencing advancements in barley,"Rajendran, N.R.; Qureshi, N.; Pourkheirandish, M.","Barley is considered an ideal crop to study cereal genetics due to its close relationship with wheat and diploid ancestral genome. It plays a crucial role in reducing risks to global food security posed by climate change. Genetic variations in the traits of interest in crops are vital for their improvement. DNA markers have been widely used to estimate these variations in populations. With the advancements in next-generation sequencing, breeders could access different types of genetic variations within different lines, with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) being the most common type. However, genotyping barley with whole genome sequencing (WGS) is challenged by the higher cost and computational demand caused by the large genome size (5.5GB) and a high proportion of repetitive sequences (80%). Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) protocols based on restriction enzymes and target enrichment allow a cost-effective SNP discovery by reducing the genome complexity. In general, GBS has opened up new horizons for plant breeding and genetics. Though considered a reliable alternative to WGS, GBS also presents various computational difficulties, but GBS-specific pipelines are designed to overcome these challenges. Moreover, a robust design for GBS can facilitate the imputation to the WGS level of crops with high linkage disequilibrium. The complete exploitation of GBS advancements will pave the way to a better understanding of crop genetics and offer opportunities for the successful improvement of barley and its close relatives.",CGIAR Trust Fund,English,10.3389/fpls.2022.931423,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22193,2022,Frontiers in Plant Science,Frontiers Media S.A.,,barley; genotyping; restriction enzymes; single nucleotide polymorphism; genotyping by sequencing; target enrichment
Metrics for optimum allocation of resources on the composition and characterization of crop collections: The CIMMYT wheat collection as a proof of concept,"Reyes-Valdés, M.H.; Burgueño, J.; Sansaloni, C.; Payne, T.S.; Pacheco Gil, Rosa Angela; González-Cortés, A.","Crop genebank collections are important resources for preserving genetic diversity to face the worldwide demand for food and coping with crop diseases and climate change. However, genebanks tend to accumulate materials without systematic collection growth. Thus, tools for optimizing collections are expected to help improvement of genebanks quality. Furthermore, the genotyping efforts of genebanks would benefit from tools that can help to sample the accessions. A set of parameters to aid the optimization of genebanks are defined, in which Relative Balance is central. In this study, the foundation of our mathematical approach was Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing formulas with consistent properties. Two examples were used as proof of concept. The first one was the comparison between actual and putative optimal numbers of accessions in the Triticum set of the CIMMYT (Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maíz y Trigo) Wheat Germplasm Bank, with 135,236 entries classified into ten groups. The second one was based on a set containing Triticum plus eight related genera, with 159,741 accessions classified into 217 end-groups, with the goal of illustrating the use of the analytical tools to optimize the ongoing genotyping process. The first example shows a scenario with a well-balanced allocation of accessions. The second example illustrates the optimized choice of end-groups to add 10,000 accessions to the genotyping process.

Climate data were obtained from the National Meteorological Agency. Survey data were collected from 120 randomly selected households in 2017 and complemented with focus group discussions. The Mann–Kendall approach was used to detect climate trends, while a rainfall anomaly was calculated using the rainfall anomaly index. Multinomial logit model was used to examine determinants of farmers’ adaptation to the perceived change. In most of the cases, farmers’ perceptions were in accordance with climate trend analyses. Farmers used crop diversification, adjustments of planting dates, destocking of livestock, seasonal migration, crop rotation, and climate information services to adapt to climaterelated shocks. Empirical results showed that the age and education of the household heads, family size, access to extension services, and farm and nonfarm incomes had a significant association with the adaptation practices farmers took.

Dataset of historic and modern bread and durum wheat cultivar performance under conventional and reduced tillage with full and reduced irrigation,"Honsdorf, N.; Mulvaney, M.J.; Singh, R.P.; Ammar, K.; Govaerts, B.; Verhulst, N.","Conservation agriculture (CA) is an agronomic management system based on zero tillage and residue retention. Due to its potential for climate change adaptation through the reduction of soil erosion and improved water availability, CA is becoming more important in many regions of the world. However, increased bulk density and large amounts of crop residues may be a constraint for early plant establishment. This holds especially true under irrigated production areas with high yield potential. Genotype × tillage effects on yield are not well understood and it is unclear whether tillage should be an evaluation factor in breeding programs. Fourteen CIMMYT bread (Triticum aestivum) and thirteen durum (Triticum turgidum) wheat genotypes, created between 1964 and 2011, were tested for yield and agronomic performance at CIMMYT's experimental station near Ciudad Obregon, Mexico, during nine seasons. The genotypes were subjected to different tillage and irrigation treatments which consisted of conventional and permanent raised beds with full and reduced irrigation. The dataset includes traits collected during the growing period (days to emergence, days to flowering, maturity, plant height, NDVI, days from flowering to maturity, grain production rate) and at harvest (yield, harvest index, thousand grain weight, spikes/m², grains/m², test weight) and weather data (daily minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall). Six years of data of 26 genotypes were published along with the Honsdorf et al. (2018) paper in Field Crops Research (DOI: s10.1016/j.fcr.2017.11.011).

Impact of climate change on water resources and crop production in Western Nepal: Implications and adaptation strategies,"Risal, A.; Urfels, A.; Srinivasan, Raghavan; Bayissa, Y.; Shrestha, N.; Paudel, G.; Krupnik, T.J.","Irrigation-led farming system intensification and efficient use of ground and surface water resources are currently being championed as a crucial ingredient for achieving food security and reducing poverty in Nepal. The potential scope and sustainability of irrigation interventions under current and future climates however remains poorly understood. Potential adaptation options in Western Nepal were analyzed using bias-corrected Regional Climate Model (RCM) data and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The RCM climate change scenario suggested that average annual rainfall will increase by about 4% with occurrence of increased number and intensity of rainfall events in the winter. RCM outputs also suggested that average annual maximum temperature could decrease by 1.4 °C, and average annual minimum temperature may increase by 0.3 °C from 2021 to 2050. Similarly, average monthly streamflow volume could increase by about 65% from March–April, although it could decrease by about 10% in June. Our results highlight the tight hydrological coupling of surface and groundwater. Farmers making use of surface water for irrigation in upstream subbasins may inadvertently cause a decrease in average water availability in downstream subbasins at approximately 14%, which may result in increased need to abstract groundwater to compensate for deficits. Well-designed irrigated crop rotations that fully utilize both surface and groundwater conversely may increase groundwater levels by an average of 45 mm from 2022 to 2050, suggesting that in particular subbasins the cultivation of two crops a year may not cause long-term groundwater depletion. Modeled crop yield for the winter and spring seasons were however lower under future climate change scenarios, even with sufficient irrigation application. Lower yields were associated with shortened growing periods and high temperature stress. Irrigation intensification appears to be feasible if both surface and groundwater resources are appropriately targeted and rationally used. Conjunctive irrigation planning is required for equitable and year-round irrigation supply as neither the streamflow nor groundwater can provide full and year-round irrigation for intensified cropping systems without causing the degradation of natural resources.",United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF),English,10.3390/hydrology9080132,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22136,2022,Hydrology,MDPI,,climate change; irrigation; sustainability; groundwater recharge; watersheds; simulation; management scenarios; streamflow; assessment tools

As a cool-season crop, wheat is heat-sensitive, but often exposed to high temperatures during the cultivation period. In the current study, a bread wheat panel of spring wheat genotypes, including putatively heat-tolerant Australian and CIMMYT genotypes, was exposed to a 5-day mild (34°C/28°C, day/night) or extreme (37°C/27°C) heat stress during the sensitive pollen developmental stage. Worsening effects on anther morphology were observed, as heat stress increased from mild to extreme. Even under mild heat, a significant decrease in pollen viability and number of grains per spike from primary spike was observed compared with the control (21°C/15°C), with Sunstar and two CIMMYT breeding lines performing well. A heat-specific positive correlation between the two traits indicates the important role of pollen fertility for grain setting. Interestingly, both mild and extreme heat induced development of new tillers after the heat stress, providing an alternative sink for accumulated photosynthates and significantly contributing to the final yield. Measurements of flag leaf maximum potential quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) showed an initial inhibition after the heat treatment, followed by a full recovery within a few days. Despite this, model fitting using chlorophyll soil plant analysis development (SPAD) measurements showed an earlier onset or faster senescence rate under heat stress. The data presented here provide interesting entry points for further research into pollen fertility, tillering dynamics, and leaf senescence under heat. The identified heat-tolerant wheat genotypes can be used to dissect the underlying mechanisms and breed climate-resilient wheat.",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Mexico Newton Fund,English,10.3389/fpls.2022.886541,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22124,2022,Frontiers in Plant Science,Frontiers,,heat stress; pollen; tillering; wheat; climate change; booting; pollen viability; soil plant analysis development; efficiency of photosystem ii

Recognition of the value of landrace diversity and concern about its erosion on farms have led to sustained efforts to establish ex situ collections worldwide. The degree to which these efforts have succeeded in conserving landraces has not been comprehensively assessed. Here we modelled the potential distributions of eco-geographically distinguishable groups of landraces of 25 cereal, pulse and starchy root/tuber/fruit crops within their geographic regions of diversity. We then analysed the extent to which these landrace groups are represented in genebank collections, using geographic and ecological coverage metrics as a proxy for genetic diversity. We find that ex situ conservation of landrace groups is currently moderately comprehensive on average, with substantial variation among crops; a mean of 63% ± 12.6% of distributions is currently represented in genebanks. Breadfruit, bananas and plantains, lentils, common beans, chickpeas, barley and bread wheat landrace groups are among the most fully represented, whereas the largest conservation gaps persist for pearl millet, yams, finger millet, groundnut, potatoes and peas.

Phenotypic assessment of genetic gain from selection for improved drought tolerance in semi-tropical maize populations,"Musimwa, T.R.; Molnar, T.L.; Dutta, S.; Dhliwayo, T.; Trachsel, S.; Lee, M.","Most maize production across the globe is rain-fed, and production is set to be negatively impacted as duration and occurrence of droughts increases due to climate change. Development of water-deficit tolerant maize germplasm has been a major focus for most breeding programmes. Here, we sought to assess the genetic gain for grain yield in two maize populations developed for drought tolerance at CIMMYT by evaluating their cycle progeny through hybrid performance. Inbreds derived from different cycles of the Drought Tolerant Population (DTP) and La Posta Sequia (LPS) were mated to a tester (CML550), and resulting hybrids were evaluated under managed water-deficit stress and well-watered conditions. The difference in yield between water-deficit and well-watered treatments was 27% and 36% for the DTP and LPS, respectively. Genetic gain for grain yield across cycles for the two populations was confirmed in the study. Genetic gain was observed for both treatments indicating that selection for water-deficit stress tolerance simultaneously improves grain yield in well-watered conditions. The DTP population had a genetic gain of 0.07 t ha−1 cycle−1, while the LPS had 0.16 t ha−1 cycle−1 under water-deficit conditions. Significant genetic gain was also observed in the well-watered treatments for both populations. Anthesis to silking interval was significantly reduced under water-deficit stress conditions in both populations. Plant and ear height were reduced in the LPS population in both treatments, while no reductions were observed for the trait in the DTP population. Potential water-deficit stress tolerance donor lines with yields comparable to commercial check varieties were identified.",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Iowa State University; National Institute of Food and Agriculture,English,10.1111/jac.12592,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22070,2023,Journal of Agronomy and Crop Science,Wiley,71-82,drought tolerance; water; maize; climate change; genetic gain; drought tolerant population; topcross; water deficit
Progenitor species hold untapped diversity for potential climate-responsive traits for use in wheat breeding and crop improvement,"Leigh, F.J.; Wright, T.I.C.; Horsnell, R.; Dyer, S.; Bentley, A.R.","Climate change will have numerous impacts on crop production worldwide necessitating a broadening of the germplasm base required to source and incorporate novel traits. Major variation exists in crop progenitor species for seasonal adaptation, photosynthetic characteristics, and root system architecture. Wheat is crucial for securing future food and nutrition security and its evolutionary history and progenitor diversity offer opportunities to mine favourable functional variation in the primary gene pool. Here we provide a review of the status of characterisation of wheat progenitor variation and the potential to use this knowledge to inform the use of variation in other cereal crops. Although significant knowledge of progenitor variation has been generated, we make recommendations for further work required to systematically characterise underlying genetics and physiological mechanisms and propose steps for effective use in breeding. This will enable targeted exploitation of useful variation, supported by the growing portfolio of genomics and accelerated breeding approaches.

Genome-wide association mapping indicates quantitative genetic control of spot blotch resistance in bread wheat and the favorable effects of some spot blotch loci on grain yield,"Juliana, P.; Xinyao He; Poland, J.; Shrestha, S.; Joshi, A.K.; Huerta-Espino, J.; Velu, G.; Crespo Herrera, L.A.; Mondal, S.; Kumar, U.; Bhati, P.; Vishwakarma, M.K.; Singh, R.P.; Singh, P.K.","Spot blotch caused by the fungus Bipolaris sorokiniana poses a serious threat to bread wheat production in warm and humid wheat-growing regions of the world. Hence, the major objective of this study was to identify consistent genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) markers associated with spot blotch resistance using genome-wide association mapping on a large set of 6,736 advanced bread wheat breeding lines from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center. These lines were phenotyped as seven panels at Agua Fria, Mexico between the 2013–2014 and 2019–2020 crop cycles. We identified 214 significant spot blotch associated GBS markers in all the panels, among which only 96 were significant in more than one panel, indicating a strong environmental effect on the trait and highlights the need for multiple phenotypic evaluations to identify lines with stable spot blotch resistance. The 96 consistent GBS markers were on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 1D, 2A, 3B, 4A, 5B, 5D, 6B, 7A, 7B, and 7D, including markers possibly linked to the Lr46, Sb1, Sb2 and Sb3 genes. We also report the association of the 2NS translocation from Aegilops ventricosa with spot blotch resistance in some environments. Moreover, the spot blotch favorable alleles at the 2NS translocation and two markers on chromosome 3BS (3B_2280114 and 3B_5601689) were associated with increased grain yield evaluated at several environments in Mexico and India, implying that selection for favorable alleles at these loci could enable simultaneous improvement for high grain yield and spot blotch resistance. Furthermore, a significant relationship between the percentage of favorable alleles in the lines and their spot blotch response was observed, which taken together with the multiple minor effect loci identified to be associated with spot blotch in this study, indicate quantitative genetic control of resistance. Overall, the results presented here have extended our knowledge on the genetic basis of spot blotch resistance in bread wheat and further efforts to improve genetic resistance to the disease are needed for reducing current and future losses under climate change.","Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF); Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO); Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research (FFAR); United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Crops to End Hunger (CtEH); CGIAR Research Program on Wheat; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); Accelerating Genetic Gains in Maize and Wheat for Improved Livelihoods (AGG)",English,10.3389/fpls.2022.835095,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22044,2022,Frontiers in Plant Science,Frontiers,,translocation; bipolaris sorokiniana; wheat; genotyping; spot blotch; genome-wide association study; 2ns translocation; grain yield; cimmyt

Climate change impact on wheat and maize growth in Ethiopia: a multi-model uncertainty analysis,"Mequanint, F.; Gayler, S.; Weber, T.K.D.; Tesfaye, K.; Streck, T.","Ethiopia's economy is dominated by agriculture which is mainly rain-fed and subsistence. Climate change is expected to have an adverse impact particularly on crop production. Previous studies have shown large discrepancies in the magnitude and sometimes in the direction of the impact on crop production. We assessed the impact of climate change on growth and yield of maize and wheat in Ethiopia using a multi-crop model ensemble. The multi-model ensemble (n = 48) was set up using the agroecosystem modelling framework Expert-N. The framework is modular which facilitates combining different submodels for plant growth and soil processes. The multi-model ensemble was driven by climate change projections representing the mid of the century (2021-2050) from ten contrasting climate models downscaled to finer resolution. The contributions of different sources of uncertainty in crop yield prediction were quantified. The sensitivity of crop yield to elevated CO2, increased temperature, changes in precipitations and N fertilizer were also assessed. Our results indicate that grain yields were very sensitive to changes in [CO2], temperature and N fertilizer amounts where the responses were higher for wheat than maize. The response to change in precipitation was weak, which we attribute to the high water holding capacity of the soils due to high organic carbon contents at the study sites. This may provide the sufficient buffering capacity for extended time periods with low amounts of precipitation. Under the changing climate, wheat productivity will be a major challenge with a 36 to 40% reduction in grain yield by 2050 while the impact on maize was modest. A major part of the uncertainty in the projected impact could be attributed to differences in the crop growth models. A considerable fraction of the uncertainty could also be traced back to different soil water dynamics modeling approaches in the model ensemble, which is often ignored. Uncertainties varied among the studied crop species and cultivars as well. The study highlights significant impacts of climate change on wheat yield in Ethiopia whereby differences in crop growth models causes the large part of the uncertainties.",,English,10.1371/journal.pone.0262951,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21939,2022,PLoS ONE,Public Library of Science,,cereal crops; wheat; maize; climate change; fertilizers; carbon dioxide; modelling
"Analysis of past and projected trends of rainfall and temperature parameters in Eastern and Western Hararghe zones, Ethiopia","Teshome, H.; Tesfaye, K.; Nigussie Dechassa; Tamado Tana; Huber, M.","Smallholder farmers in East and West Hararghe zones, Ethiopia frequently face problems of climate extremes. Knowledge of past and projected climate change and variability at local and regional scales can help develop adaptation measures. A study was therefore conducted to inves-tigate the spatio‐temporal dynamics of rainfall and temperature in the past (1988–2017) and projected periods of 2030 and 2050 under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) at selected stations in East and West HarargPhe zones, Ethiopia. To detect the trends and magnitude of change Mann–Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimator were employed, respectively. The result of the study indicated that for the last three decades annual and seasonal and monthly rainfall showed high variability but the changes are not statistically significant. On the other hand, the minimum temperature of the ‘Belg’ season showed a significant (p < 0.05) increment. The mean annual minimum temperature is projected to increase by 0.34 °C and 2.52 °C for 2030, and 0.41 °C and 4.15 °C for 2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. Additionally, the mean maximum temperature is projected to change by −0.02 °C and 1.14 °C for 2030, and 0.54 °C and 1.87 °C for 2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. Annual rainfall amount is also projected to increase by 2.5% and 29% for 2030, and 12% and 32% for 2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. Hence, it is concluded that there was an increasing trend in the Belg season minimum temperature. A significant increasing trend in rainfall and temperature are projected compared to the baseline period for most of the districts studied. This implies a need to design climate‐smart crop and live-stock production strategies, as well as an early warning system to counter the drastic effects of climate change and variability on agricultural production and farmers’ livelihood in the region.",,English,10.3390/atmos13010067,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21817,2022,Atmosphere,MDPI,,agriculture; climate change; climate variability; mann-kendall test; spatio-temporal dynamics
Field evaluation of heat stress-resilient maize hybrids for improved and stable maize production in Nepal,"Koirala, K.B.; Tripathi, M.P.; Seetharam, K.; Vinayan, M.T.; Zaidi, P.","In recent years, National Maize Research Program (NMRP) aimed a paradigm shift from open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) towards hybrid maize to achieve self-sufficiency in maize for food, feed, and hybrid seed within the country. In this mission, it is necessary to identify and deploy high-yielding stress-resilient maize hybrids that can cope with climate change effects, including heat stress. Under the project “Heat Tolerant Maize for Asia (HTMA)”, NMRP introduced the hybrids that performed better in previous years in different environments from International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) Hyderabad for multilocation on-farm testing. Fifteen genotypes were evaluated at two locations, two sites in Madi, Chitwan, and one in Ghorahi, Dang, along with Rampur Hybrid-8 as a heat-tolerant check, and RML-86/RML-96 and RML-95/RML-96 as normal checks.

Identification and validation of genomic regions associated with charcoal rot resistance in tropical maize by genome-wide association and linkage mapping,"Rashid, Z.; Kaur, H.; Babu, V.; Singh, P.K.; Harlapur, S.I.; Nair, S.K.","Charcoal rot is a post-flowering stalk rot (PFSR) disease of maize caused by the fungal pathogen, Macrophomina phaseolina. It is a serious concern for smallholder maize cultivation, due to significant yield loss and plant lodging at harvest, and this disease is expected to surge with climate change effects like drought and high soil temperature. For identification and validation of genomic variants associated with charcoal rot resistance, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted on CIMMYT Asia association mapping panel comprising 396 tropical-adapted lines, especially to Asian environments. The panel was phenotyped for disease severity across two locations with high disease prevalence in India. A subset of 296,497 high-quality SNPs filtered from genotyping by sequencing was correcting for population structure and kinship matrices for single locus mixed linear model (MLM) of GWAS analysis. A total of 19 SNPs were identified to be associated with charcoal rot resistance with P-value ranging from 5.88 × 10−06 to 4.80 × 10−05. Haplotype regression analysis identified 21 significant haplotypes for the trait with Bonferroni corrected P ≤ 0.05. For validating the associated variants and identifying novel QTLs, QTL mapping was conducted using two F2:3 populations. Two QTLs with overlapping physical intervals, qMSR6 and qFMSR6 on chromosome 6, identified from two different mapping populations and contributed by two different resistant parents, were co-located with the SNPs and haplotypes identified at 103.51 Mb on chromosome 6. Similarly, several SNPs/haplotypes identified on chromosomes 3, 6 and 8 were also found to be physically co-located within QTL intervals detected in one of the two mapping populations. The study also noted that several SNPs/haplotypes for resistance to charcoal rot were located within physical intervals of previously reported QTLs for Gibberella stalk rot resistance, which opens up a new possibility for common disease resistance mechanisms for multiple stalk rots.",,English,10.3389/fpls.2021.726767,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21796,2021,Frontiers in Plant Science,Frontiers,,genomes; chromosome mapping; haplotypes; charcoal; rots; maize; genome-wide association study; linkage mapping; haplotype analysis
"Effect of climate-smart agriculture practices on climate change adaptation, greenhouse gas mitigation and economic efficiency of rice-wheat system in India","Kakraliya Suresh Kumar; Jat, H.S.; Sapkota, T.; Ishwar Singh; Kakraliya, M.; Gora, M.K.; Sharma, P.C.; Jat, M.L.","Conventional rice–wheat (RW) rotation in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of South Asia is tillage, water, energy, and capital intensive. Coupled with these, crop residue burning contributes significantly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and environmental pollution. So, to evaluate the GHG mitigation potential of various climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAPs), an on-farm research trial was conducted during 2014–2017 in Karnal, India. Six management scenarios (portfolios of practices), namely, Sc1—business as usual (BAU)/conventional tillage (CT) without residue, Sc2—CT with residue, Sc3—reduced tillage (RT) with residue + recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF), Sc4—RT/zero tillage (ZT) with residue + RDF, Sc5—ZT with residue + RDF + GreenSeeker + Tensiometer, and Sc6—Sc5 + nutrient-expert tool, were included. The global warming potential (GWP) of the RW system under CSAPs (Sc4, Sc5, and Sc6) and the improved BAU (Sc2 and Sc3) were 33–40% and 4–26% lower than BAU (7653 kg CO2 eq./ha/year), respectively. This reflects that CSAPs have the potential to mitigate GWP by ~387 metric tons (Mt) CO2 eq./year from the 13.5 Mha RW system of South Asia. Lower GWP under CSAPs resulted in 36–44% lower emission intensity (383 kg CO2 eq./Mg/year) compared to BAU (642 kg CO2 eq./Mg/year). Meanwhile, the N-factor productivity and eco-efficiency of the RW system under CSAPs were 32–57% and 70–105% higher than BAU, respectively, which reflects that CSAPs are more economically and environmentally sustainable than BAU. The wheat yield obtained under various CSAPs was 0.62 Mg/ha and 0.84 Mg/ha higher than BAU during normal and bad years (extreme weather events), respectively. Thus, it is evident that CSAPs can cope better with climatic extremes than BAU. Therefore, a portfolio of CSAPs should be promoted in RW belts for more adaptation and climate change mitigation.",,English,10.3390/agriculture11121269,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21795,2021,Agriculture,MDPI,,global warming; carbon sequestration; climate change mitigation; efficiency; zero tillage; residues; global warming potential; eco-efficiency; residue management

Transformation of agriculture to low-carbon food systems requires much larger investments in low emission development options from global climate finance, domestic budgets, and the private sector. Innovative financing mechanisms and instruments that integrate climate finance, agriculture development budgets, and private sector investment can improve and increase farmers' and other value chain actors' access to finance while delivering environmental, economic, and social benefits. Investment cases assessed in this study provide rich information to design and implement mitigation options in agriculture through unlocking additional sources of public and private capital, strengthening the links between financial institutions, farmers, and agribusiness, and coordination of actions across multiple stakeholders.

Quantifying senescence in bread wheat using multispectral imaging from an unmanned aerial vehicle and QTL mapping,"Hassan, M.A.; Mengjiao Yang; Rasheed, A.; Xiuling Tian; Reynolds, M.P.; Xianchun Xia; Yonggui Xiao; He Zhonghu","Environmental stresses from climate change can alter source–sink relations during plant maturation, leading to premature senescence and decreased yields. Elucidating the genetic control of natural variations for senescence in wheat (Triticum aestivum) can be accelerated using recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based imaging techniques. Here, we describe the use of UAVs to quantify senescence in wheat using vegetative indices (VIs) derived from multispectral images. We detected senescence with high heritability, as well as its impact on grain yield (GY), in a doubled-haploid population and parent cultivars at various growth time points (TPs) after anthesis in the field. Selecting for slow senescence using a combination of different UAV-based VIs was more effective than using a single ground-based vegetation index. We identified 28 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for vegetative growth, senescence, and GY using a 660K single-nucleotide polymorphism array. Seventeen of these new QTL for VIs from UAV-based multispectral imaging were mapped on chromosomes 2B, 3A, 3D, 5A, 5D, 5B, and 6D; these QTL have not been reported previously using conventional phenotyping methods. This integrated approach allowed us to identify an important, previously unreported, senescence-related locus on chromosome 5D that showed high phenotypic variation (up to 18.1%) for all UAV-based VIs at all TPs during grain filling. This QTL was validated for slow senescence by developing kompetitive allele-specific PCR markers in a natural population. Our results suggest that UAV-based high-throughput phenotyping is advantageous for temporal assessment of the genetics underlying for senescence in wheat.",,English,10.1093/plphys/kiab431,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21770,2021,Plant Physiology,Oxford University Press,2623-2636,senescence; soft wheat; multispectral imagery; unmanned aerial vehicles; chromosome mapping
Closer vein spacing by ectopic expression of nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat proteins in rice leaves,"Shuen-Fang Lo; Chatterjee, J.; Biswal, A.K.; I. Lun Liu; Yu-Pei Chang; Pei-Jing Chen; Wanchana, S.; Elmido-Mabilangan, A.; Nepomuceno, R.A.; Bandyopadhyay, A.; Yue-Ie Hsing; Quick, W.P.","Key message: Elevated expression of nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat proteins led to closer vein spacing and higher vein density in rice leaves. Abstract: To feed the growing global population and mitigate the negative effects of climate change, there is a need to improve the photosynthetic capacity and efficiency of major crops such as rice to enhance grain yield potential. Alterations in internal leaf morphology and cellular architecture are needed to underpin some of these improvements. One of the targets is to generate a “Kranz-like” anatomy in leaves that includes decreased interveinal spacing close to that in C4 plant species. As C4 photosynthesis has evolved from C3 photosynthesis independently in multiple lineages, the genes required to facilitate C4 may already be present in the rice genome. The Taiwan Rice Insertional Mutants (TRIM) population offers the advantage of gain-of-function phenotype trapping, which accelerates the identification of rice gene function. In the present study, we screened the TRIM population to determine the extent to which genetic plasticity can alter vein density (VD) in rice. Close vein spacing mutant 1 (CVS1), identified from a VD screening of approximately 17,000 TRIM lines, conferred heritable high leaf VD. Increased vein number in CVS1 was confirmed to be associated with activated expression of two nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins. Overexpression of the two NB-LRR genes individually in rice recapitulates the high VD phenotype, due mainly to reduced interveinal mesophyll cell (M cell) number, length, bulliform cell size and thus interveinal distance. Our studies demonstrate that the trait of high VD in rice can be achieved by elevated expression of NB-LRR proteins limited to no yield penalty.",,English,10.1007/s00299-021-02810-5,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21759,2022,Plant Cell Reports,Springer,319-335,leaf veins; proteins; rice; close vein spacing; vein density; nucleotide-binding; leucine-rich repeat
"Precision nutrient rates and placement in conservation maize-wheat system: effects on crop productivity, profitability, nutrient-use efficiency, and environmental footprints","Jat, R.K.; Bijarniya, D.; Kakraliya Suresh Kumar; Sapkota, T.; Kakraliya, M.; Jat, M.L.","Intensive tillage-based production systems coupled with inefficient fertilizer management practices have led to increased production costs, sub-optimal productivity, and significant environmental externalities. Conservation agriculture (CA) is being increasingly advocated as a management strategy to overcome these issues but precision nutrient management under the CA-based maize-wheat system is rarely studied. Two year’s (2014–2015 and 2015–2016) research was conducted at the research farm of BISA, Pusa, Bihar, India to develop precision nutrient management practices for CA-based management in the maize-wheat system. Seven treatment combinations involving (i) tillage (conventional tillage; CT & permanent beds; PB) and (ii) nutrient management rates, application methods (farmers’ fertilizer practices; FFP, state recommended dose of fertilizer; SR and precision nutrient management using Nutrient Expert tool; NE and GreenSeeker; (GS), applied using two methods; broadcasting (B) and drilling (D)) were investigated for multiple parameters. The results showed that NE, NE+GS, and SR-based nutrient management tactics with drilling improved crop yields, nutrient-use efficiency (NUE), and economic profitability relative to NE-broadcasting, SR broadcasting, and FFP broadcasting methods. Maize-wheat system productivity and net returns under NE+GS-drilling on PB were significantly higher by 31.2%, 49.7% compared to FFP-broadcasting method, respectively. Total global warming potential (GWP) was lower in the PB-based maize-wheat system coupled with precision nutrient management compared to CT-based maize-wheat system with FFP. Higher (15.2%) carbon sustainability index (CSI) was recorded with NE-drilling compared to FFP-broadcasting method. Results suggests that PB-based maize-wheat system together with precision nutrient management approaches (NE+GS+drilling) can significantly increase crop yields, NUE, and profitability while reducing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from maize-wheat systems in eastern Indo Gangetic Plains (IGP).",,English,10.3390/agronomy11112320,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21751,2021,Agronomy,MDPI,,site specific nutrient management; tillage; residues; greenhouse gas emissions; climate change mitigation; greenseeker; residue management
Impacts of climate change on agriculture and household welfare in Zambia: an economy-wide analysis,"Ngoma, H.; Lupiya, P.; Kabisa, M.; Hartley, F.","Rainfed agriculture is the primary impact channel for agrarian economies like Zambia, but it is uncertain how future climate will be and by how much it will affect agriculture, household welfare, and economic growth. We use an integrated framework that combines climate models, biophysical models, and an economy-wide computable general equilibrium model based on a 2007 Social Accounting Matrix to assess the impacts of climate change on agriculture, economic growth, and household welfare in Zambia. We address the uncertainty associated with climate change by using data from the general circulation models based on 819 potential future climate scenarios. There are three main results. First, rainfall is projected to decline with the Southern and Western regions of Zambia worst affected, and temperature is projected to increase by 2050. Second, climate change is projected to reduce crop yield and production, with maize expected to be the hardest hit. These impacts are progressive over time. And lastly, based only on the agricultural impact channel, climate change will likely reduce national gross domestic product (GDP), agricultural production, and household welfare. There are significant regional differences, with the Southern and Western regions projected to bear the most substantial negative impacts of climate change on crop yield and production. These findings have implications for targeting of adaptation interventions needed to sustain the future of smallholder agriculture in Zambia.",,English,10.1007/s10584-021-03168-z,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21750,2021,Climatic Change,Springer,,models; climate change; welfare; computable general equilibrium models
"Maize varietal replacement in Eastern and Southern Africa: bottlenecks, drivers and strategies for improvement","Chivasa, W.; Regasa, M.W.; Chere, A.T.; Setimela, P.; Gethi, J.; Magorokosho, C.; Davis, N.; Prasanna, B.M.","Seed security is vital for food security. Rapid-cycle, climate-adaptive breeding programs and seed systems that deliver new, elite varieties to farmers to replace obsolete ones can greatly improve the productivity of maize-based cropping systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Despite the importance and benefits of accelerated varietal turnover to climate change adaptation and food security, the rate of maize varietal replacement in SSA is slow. This review outlines the major bottlenecks, drivers, risks, and benefits of active replacement of maize varieties in eastern and southern Africa (ESA) and highlights strategies that are critical to varietal turnover. Although there is an upsurge of new seed companies in ESA and introduction of new varieties with better genetics in the market, some established seed companies continue to sell old (over 15-year-old) varieties. Several recently developed maize hybrids in ESA have shown significant genetic gains under farmers’ conditions. Empirical evidence also shows that timely replacement of old products results in better business success as it helps seed companies maintain or improve market share and brand relevance. Therefore, proactive management of product life cycles by seed companies benefits both the farmers and businesses alike, contributing to improved food security and adaptation to the changing climate.",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); US Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research,English,10.1016/j.gfs.2021.100589,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21745,2022,Global Food Security,Elsevier,,maize; varieties; genetic gain; products; life cycle analysis; varietal replacement; product life cycle; product management
Toward greater sustainability: how investing in soil health may enhance maize productivity in Southern Africa,"Thierfelder, C.; Paterson, E.; Mwafulirwa, L.; Daniell, T.J.; Cairns, J.E.; Mhlanga, B.; Baggs, E.M.","Climate change and soil fertility decline are major threats to smallholder farmers' food and nutrition security in southern Africa, and cropping systems that improve soil health are needed to address these challenges. Cropping systems that invest in soil organic matter, such as no-tillage (NT) with crop residue retention, have been proposed as potential solutions. However, a key challenge for assessing the sustainability of NT systems is that soil carbon (C) stocks develop over long timescales, and there is an urgent need to identify trajectory indicators of sustainability and crop productivity. Here we examined the effects of NT as compared with conventional tillage without residue retention on relationships between soil characteristics and maize (Zea mays L.) productivity in long-term on-farm and on-station trials in Zimbabwe. Our results show that relationships between soil characteristics and maize productivity, and the effects of management on these relationships, varied with soil type. Total soil nitrogen (N) and C were strong predictors of maize grain yield and above-ground biomass (i.e., stover) in the clayey soils, but not in the sandy soils, under both managements. This highlights context-specific benefits of management that fosters the accumulation of soil C and N stocks. Despite a strong effect of NT management on soil C and N in sandy soils, this accrual was not sufficient to support increased crop productivity in these soils. We suggest that sandy soils should be the priority target of NT with organic resource inputs interventions in southern Africa, as mineral fertilizer inputs alone will not halt the soil fertility decline. This will require a holistic management approach and input of C in various forms (e.g., biomass from cover crops and tree components, crop residues, in combination with mineral fertilizers). Clayey soils on the other hand have greater buffering capacity against detrimental effects of soil tillage and low C input.",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC),English,10.1017/S1742170521000442,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21740,2022,Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems,Cambridge University Press,166-177,climate change adaptation; climate-smart agriculture; conservation agriculture; zero tillage; soil quality; sustainable intensification; soil health indicators
Increase in irrigated wheat yield in north-west Mexico from 1960 to 2019: unravelling the negative relationship to minimum temperature,"Fischer, T.; Honsdorf, N.; Lilley, J.; Mondal, S.; Ortiz-Monasterio, I.; Verhulst, N.","Conservation agriculture (CA) systems represent a set of three soil management principles: minimarbance, permanent soil cover and crop rotations ‐ whereas the CA‐based systems in this study add the bed and furrow tillage techniques as integral elements of CA. Studies on the effects of long‐term CA‐based systems on soil health and crop productivity are rare globally, particularly in Ethiopia. This study aimed at investigating the long‐term (2005–2013) influence of CA‐based systems on soil health and crop productivity in northern Ethiopia. The treatments we used include two types of CA‐based systems (permanent raised bed PRB and contour furrowing CF) and conventional tillage (CT) arranged in a randomized complete block design. Soil samples were collected at 0–10 cm soil depth to assess soil health. Piecewise structural equation modeling (PSEM) was used to analyze linkages between management practices, soil health and crop productivity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi spore abundance and root colonization was higher in PRB followed by CF compared to CT (p < 0.05). Significantly different soil N of 1.4 and 0.9 g kg−1 and available P of 6.7 and 4.1 ppm were recorded for PRB and CT, respectively. Higher straw and grain yield of 12 and 4.3, 10 and 3.5, 8 and 2.8 t ha−1 were recorded for PRB, CF and CT, respectively. Outputs of the PSEM highlighted two pathways in which CA‐based systems contributed to improved productivity: (a) via higher density of bacteria and improved hydraulic conductivity, and (b) via higher density of fungi and increase soil organic carbon content in the topsoil.

Transcription factor TaWRKY51 is a positive regulator in root architecture and grain yield contributing traits,"Yuying Li; Yanfei Zhang; Chaonan Li; Xin Chen; Lili Yang; Jie Zhang; Jingyi Wang; Long Li; Reynolds, M.P.; Ruilian Jing; Xinguo Mao; Chenyang Wang","Wheat is one of the staple food crops. The utilization of elite genetic resources to develop resource-efficient wheat varieties is an effective approach to deal with the challenges of climate change and population growth. WRKY transcription factors (TFs) are multifaceted regulators of plant growth and development and response to environmental stress. The previous studies have shown that TaWRKY51 positively regulates the development of lateral roots, while its roles in agronomic trait development are not clear, and there is no functional marker for molecular breeding. To bridge the gap, we cloned the three members of TaWRKY51 and found they were highly expressed in the roots and flag leaves at the flowering stage and were induced by the multiple abiotic stresses and phytohormones. The highest expression level was observed in TaWRKY51-2D, followed by TaWRKY51-2A and -2B. The two haplotypes/alleles for each member were identified in the natural populations, and functional markers were developed accordingly. The association assays revealed that Hap-2A-I was an elite haplotype for the large spike, Hap-2B-II and allele-G were favorable haplotypes/alleles for long root. However, only Hap-2A-I was selected for wheat breeding in China. The results of transgenic experiments showed that the rice lines overexpressing TaWRKY51 had large panicle, high thousand-grain-weight, and more crown and lateral roots, which further confirmed the results of association analysis. In short, TaWRKY51 is a positive regulator of the root architecture and grain yield (GY) contributing traits. The elite gene resources and functional markers may be utilized in the marker-assisted selection for high-yield breeding in wheat.",,English,10.3389/fpls.2021.734614,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21721,2021,Frontiers in Plant Science,Frontiers,,transcription factors; agronomic characters; haplotypes; genetic markers; association analysis; functional markers
Introgression of maize diversity for drought tolerance: subtropical maize landraces as source of new positive variants,"Medeiros Barbosa, P.A.; Fritsche-Neto, R.; Carvalho, M.; Petroli, C.; Burgueño, J.; Galli, G.; Willcox, M.; Sonder, K.; Vidal Martinez, A.; Sifuentes-Ibarra, E.; Molnar, T.L.","Current climate change models predict an increased frequency and intensity of drought for much of the developing world within the next 30 years. These events will negatively affect maize yields, potentially leading to economic and social instability in many smallholder farming communities. Knowledge about the genetic resources available for traits related to drought tolerance has great importance in developing breeding program strategies. The aim of this research was to study a maize landrace introgression panel to identify chromosomal regions associated with a drought tolerance index. For that, we performed Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) on 1326 landrace progenies developed by the CIMMYT Genetic Resources Program, originating from 20 landraces populations collected in arid regions. Phenotypic data were obtained from early testcross trials conducted in three sites and two contrasting irrigation environments, full irrigation (well-watered) and reduced irrigation (drought). The populations were genotyped using the DArTSeq® platform, and a final set of 5,695 SNPs markers was used. The genotypic values were estimated using spatial adjustment in a two-stage analysis. First, we performed the individual analysis for each site/irrigation treatment combination. The best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs) were used to calculate the Harmonic Mean of Relative Performance (HMRP) as a drought tolerance index for each testcross. The second stage was a joint analysis, which was performed using the HMRP to obtain the best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs) of the index for each genotype. Then, GWAS was performed to determine the marker-index associations and the marker-Grain Yield (GY) associations for the two irrigation treatments. We detected two significant markers associated with the drought-tolerance index, four associated with GY in drought condition, and other four associated with GY in irrigated conditions each. Although each of these markers explained less than 0.1% of the phenotypic variation for the index and GY, we found two genes likely related to the plant response to drought stress. For these markers, alleles from landraces provide a slightly higher yield under drought conditions. Our results indicate that the positive diversity delivered by landraces are still present on the backcrosses and this is a potential breeding strategy for improving maize for drought tolerance and for trait introgression bringing new superior allelic diversity from landraces to breeding populations.",,English,10.3389/fpls.2021.691211,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21667,2021,Frontiers in Plant Science,Frontiers,,plant breeding; genomes; spatial analysis; abiotic stress; maize; genome-wide association study; early testcross
Putting social networks to practical use: improving last-mile dissemination systems for climate and market information services in developing countries,"Simon, W.J.; Krupnik, T.J.; Aguilar-Gallegos, N.; Halbherr, L.; Groot, J.","Understanding how to improve the accessibility and timely dissemination of weather and market information can help farmers adapt their management to climate change impacts. Our objective is to use Social Network Analysis (SNA) as a tool to identify potential opportunities for improving weather and market advisory dissemination to rural communities and to explore the relationship between farmers’ access to information and yield and selling price. As a case study, we applied SNA to 313 farmers in Bangladesh to analyze weather and market information networks and farmers' friendship networks as a potential proxy for information exchange. Farmer access to information, dominant sources of information and potential speed of information transfer were key criteria for our analysis. Our results indicate that weather and market information networks in coastal Bangladesh depended on certain key sources of information, while the friendship network was decentralized and interconnected, with few isolated farmers. We showed that farmers networks are significantly correlated with several socio-agro-economic variables; however, there was little indication of a relationship between information access and yield and selling price. We conclude that a mixed approach of targeting central actors and broadcasting information to farmers may be a suitable strategy to reach a maximum number of farmers as well as the most isolated farmers. Our study highlights that SNA can be a promising tool to reveal hidden structures of information flows in farmer communities and provide valuable insights for developing information dissemination strategies that reach even the most remote and underserved farmers.",,English,10.1016/j.cliser.2021.100248,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21646,2021,Climate Services,Elsevier,,social network analysis; markets; climate change adaptation; agriculture; climate services; market advisory
Smallholder farmers’ perceptions of climate change and adaptation practices for maize production in eastern Ethiopia,"Teshome, H.; Tesfaye, K.; Nigussie Dechassa; Tamado Tana; Huber, M.","Climate change and variability is affecting maize (Zea mays L.) production in eastern Ethiopia but how farmers perceive the challenge and respond to it is not well documented. A study was conducted to analyze smallholder maize farmers’ perception of climate change/variability and identify their adaptation approaches and barriers for adaptation in the eastern highlands of Ethiopia. Meteorological data were assessed to provide evidence of the perceived change. A survey was conducted in six major maize-producing kebeles with a total of 364 respondents. A multi-stage sampling method was employed for selecting the sample units for the study. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and a multinomial logit model. The results indicated that 78% of the sampled smallholder maize farmers perceived increasing temperatures while 83% perceived decreasing amounts of rainfall. About 75% of the farmers indicated that they became aware of climate change and variability from their own experience and perceived deforestation as the main cause. The farmers perceived that drought, diseases and pests, dwindling soil fertility, and declining crop yields were the major impacts of climate change that affected maize production. The farmers’ major adaptation practices include adjusting planting dates, using improved maize varieties, intercropping, recommended mineral fertilizers, supplementary irrigation, and soil and water conservation measures. Econometric analysis revealed that low educational level, shortage of land, large family sizes, age, lack of access to irrigation water, lack of access to credit, and lack of access to extension services were the most important barriers to climate change adaptation in the area. It is concluded that farmers cultivating maize in the study area have perceived climate change and use certain adaptation strategies to counter its negative impacts on maize production. This implies that policies should be geared towards strengthening farmers’ efforts to adapt to climate change and alleviate the existing barriers in promoting adaptation strategies for enhancing the productivity of maize.",,English,10.3390/su13179622,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21644,2021,Sustainability,MDPI,,adaptation; climate change; farmers' attitudes; weather data; zea mays; climate variability; adaptation practices; causes of climate change; farmers’ perception; meteorological data
Water budgeting in conservation agriculture-based sub-surface drip irrigation in tropical maize using HYDRUS-2D in South Asia,"Patra, K.; Parihar, C.M.; Nayak, H.S.; Rana, B.; Singh, V.K.; Jat, S.L.; Panwar, S.; Parihar, M.D.; Singh, L.K.; Sidhu, H.S.; Gerard, B.; Jat, M.L.","In water scarce regions of South Asia, diversification of rice with maize is being advocated towards sustainability of cereal-based cropping systems. Adoption of innovative agronomic management practices, i.e., conservation agriculture (CA) and sub-surface drip irrigation (SSDI) are considered as key strategies for much needed interventions to address the challenges of water scarcity under projected climate change. Benefits from CA and SSDI concerning water economy are well-established, however, information about their complementarity and water budgeting in cereal-based systems are lacking. A field study was conducted with process-based model (HYDRUS-2D) to understand water transport, root water uptake and components of soil water balance in maize grown in rotation with wheat after five years of continuous adoption of conservation agriculture. In this study, altogether eight treatments comprising of 6 CA+ treatments (CA coupled with SSDI); permanent beds using sub-surface drip (PB-SSD) with (WR) and without (WOR) crop residue at different N rates, 0, 120 and 150 kg N ha−1 were compared with CA (PB using furrow irrigation-FI with crop residue-120 kg N ha−1) and conventional tillage practices (CT) (CT using FI without crop residue-120 kg N ha−1). Results showed that the model could simulate the daily changes in profile soil water content with reasonable accuracy in all the treatments. Simulated soil water balance indicated higher cumulative root water uptake (CRWU), lower cumulative evaporation (CE) and higher soil water retention in CA+ (PB-SSD+ crop residue at 150 and 120 kg N ha−1) than CA and CT plots. Hydrus-2D model efficiency > 0, RMSE between 0.009–0.026 and R2 value between 0.80–0.92 at P < 0.01 indicates that the model is performing efficiently. The mean evaporation from CA+ treatments was 10 and 36% less than CA and CT treatments, respectively. On average, CRWU under CA+ treatments were 14–48% higher than FI treatments. The mean cumulative deep drainage in CA+ plots was 80–100 mm less than CA and CT plots. In CA+ based plots significantly higher biomass production and radiation use efficiency were observed with reduced water use than CA and CT. Therefore, the study justifies the water-saving nature of CA+, while maintaining higher productivity and meeting the transpiration demand of crops and halting unnecessary evaporation and deep drainage losses.",,English,10.1038/s41598-021-93866-6,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21636,2021,Nature Scientific Reports,Nature Publishing Group,,conservation agriculture; water scarcity; trickle irrigation; maize
Ex-ante adaptation strategies for climate challenges in sub-Saharan Africa: macro and micro perspectives,"Rahut, D.B.; Aryal, J.P.; Marenya, P.P.","Farmers in sub-Saharan Africa are facing serious consequences from climate change, which pose obstacles to meeting UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as zero hunger, ending poverty, ensuring healthy lives, and promoting wellbeing. In light of these growing challenges, we used data collected in 2018 from farm households in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, and Mozambique to investigate the climate threats encountered by farmers and the ex-ante climate risk adaptation strategies they adopted. Drought, floods, hailstorms, and crop pests and diseases were the most common climate threats in these countries. Unlike previous studies, we also assessed the adaptive capacity at the macro level by using secondary data. We reviewed the factors that affect the adaptive capacity of each nation to address climate risks. At the micro-level, we assessed the factors influencing the choice of ex-ante adaptation measures by using primary data collected from 4351 farm households. Micro-level data also include the variables that indicate the adaptive capacity of farm households, such as asset ownership, demographic characteristics, and participation in local institutions. Results showed five major ex-ante climate risk adaptation strategies – change in farming practice, sustainable land management, seek alternative livelihood, saving, and other unspecified strategies – are prevalent in the region. We used a multivariate probit model to investigate the factors explaining the choice of ex-ante climate risk adaptation strategy. Results showed that female-headed households and households with married heads were more likely than male-headed households to change farming practices to adapt to climate risk. Surprisingly, land ownership was found to be insignificant in all cases. Relatively rich families tended to apply either change in farming practice or saving as a measure to adapt to climate risks. Training on climate-smart agriculture was found to enhance the adoption of sustainable land management as adaptation strategies by farm households. Our findings exhibit substantial differences within and among countries regarding the adoption of ex-ante climate adaptation strategies by farm households. In comparison to farmers in Mozambique's northern region, farmers in all other locations were more likely to apply agricultural measures such as change in farming practice and sustainable land management, while they were more likely to apply non-agricultural measures to adapt to risk.

Prevalence of household food insecurity in East Africa: linking food access with climate vulnerability,"Gebre, G.G.; Rahut, D.B.","The prevalence of food insecurity is much higher in East Africa than in other parts of the world. Climate change and associated variability are important contributors to food insecurity in the region. Using primary data collected in 2018/19 from Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania, this study examines the links between the prevalence of household food insecurity (the access to food dimension) and vulnerability to climate change in East Africa. The Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) was constructed to measure the prevalence of household food insecurity, and an ordered probit econometrics model was used to investigate the factors affecting the prevalence rates. The aggregate results show that 52% of the total sampled households in the region were food-secure; 15% and 26% were mildly food-secure and moderately food-insecure, respectively; and the remaining 7% were severely food-insecure. The ordered probit results suggest that exposure to climate change extremes and crop losses caused by these extremes significantly contribute to the prevalence of food insecurity across countries in East Africa. The results also indicate that households’ adaptive capacity plays a significant role in reducing the prevalence of food insecurity. The demographic/human, social, financial, physical, and natural assets/capital of the household also play a significant role in reducing household-level food insecurity in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania.",,English,10.1016/j.crm.2021.100333,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21625,2021,Climate Risk Management,Elsevier,,food insecurity; households; climate change; vulnerability
"Are farmers willing to pay for participatory climate information services? Insights from a case study in peri-urban Khulna, Bangladesh","Paparrizos, S.; Kumar, U.; Amjath-Babu, T.S; Ludwig, F.","Among technological adaptation options, climate information services (CIS) offers high potential as a means to offset climate change impacts and build resilience in farming areas of developing countries. This study explores the potential of CIS, by investigating the case of participatory CIS development in the Lower Ganges Delta of Bangladesh. Specifically, we examined the value farmers attached to a co-developed CIS as decision support tool and the price farmers were willing to pay for CIS subscriptions. Based on a hypothetical market for CIS, we used contingent valuation with a double-bounded dichotomous choice format to determine farmers willingness to pay (WTP) for CIS. Two samples were included: an experiment group of farmers exposed to and trained in CIS use for farm decision-making and a control group of farmers without prior exposure to CIS. More than 90% of farmers in the experiment group expressed willingness to pay for CIS, compared to 75% of the control group. The annual subscription fees farmers were willing to pay ranged from 970.92 taka (US $11.45) to 1387.20 taka ($16.36). WTP was greater among farmers who had participated in CIS co-development. The main factors influencing farmers’ willingness to pay were CIS cost and prior exposure and training to CIS. Given that Bangladesh has more than 16.5 million farm households, these findings suggest huge market potential for CIS. Based on the high potential of participatory CIS, governmental institutions, the private sector and social entrepreneurs are called upon to develop CIS for smallholders, to unlock smallholders’ agriculture potential.",,English,10.1016/j.cliser.2021.100241,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21623,2021,Climate Services,Elsevier,,information services; climate; peri-urban agriculture; willingness to pay; climate information services; double-bounded dichotomous contingent valuation

Nocturnal stomatal conductance in wheat is growth-stage specific and shows genotypic variation,"McAusland, L.; Smith, K.E.; Williams, A.; Molero, G.; Murchie, E.","Nocturnal stomatal conductance (gsn) represents a significant source of water loss, with implications for metabolism, thermal regulation and water-use efficiency. With increasing nocturnal temperatures due to climate change, it is vital to identify and understand variation in the magnitude and responses of gsn in major crops. We assessed interspecific variation in gsn and daytime stomatal conductance (gs) in a wild relative and modern spring wheat genotype. To investigate intraspecific variation, we grew six modern wheat genotypes and two landraces under well watered, simulated field conditions. For the diurnal data, higher gsn in the wild relative was associated with significantly lower nocturnal respiration and higher daytime CO2 assimilation while both species exhibited declines in gsn post-dusk and pre-dawn. Lifetime gsn achieved rates of 5.7–18.9% of gs. Magnitude of gsn was genotype specific 'and positively correlated with gs. gsn and gs were significantly higher on the adaxial surface. No relationship was determined between harvest characteristics, stomatal morphology and gsn, while cuticular conductance was genotype specific. Finally, for the majority of genotypes, gsn declined with age. Here we present the discovery that variation in gsn occurs across developmental, morphological and temporal scales in nonstressed wheat, presenting opportunities for exploiting intrinsic variation under heat or water stressed conditions.",,English,10.1111/nph.17563,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21602,2021,New Phytologist,Wiley,162-175,developmental stages; stomata; triticum aestivum; water use efficiency; growth stage; nocturnal conductance

In part, this reflects the challenges in applying, adapting, and understanding this complex and multi-dimensional agricultural innovation in the context of diverse farming systems. In this paper, we applied an integrated framework that combines bioeconomic simulation, risk analysis, adoption theory, and impact assessment to investigate how various combinations of CA components (no-tillage, soil cover, crop diversification, plus growing a new crop or variety) performed over a 10-year period in representative farms in a central Mexican case study. We found significant differences in profit, net value, downside risk, and risk-aversion cost between double-component scenarios (and improved CA to a lesser extent) and all other scenarios, which suggested that disaggregating CA into smaller component packages could increase farmer adoption in risky contexts. Our findings provided valuable insights on CA feasibility and could help establish policy and reporting metrics.

Climate risks and adaptation strategies of farmers in East Africa and South Asia,"Aryal, J.P.; Sapkota, T.; Rahut, D.B.; Marenya, P.P.; Stirling, C.","Understanding major climate risks, adaptation strategies, and factors influencing the choice of those strategies is crucial to reduce farmers’ vulnerability. Employing comprehensive data from 2822 farm households in Ethiopia and Kenya (East Africa; EA) and 1902 farm households in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal (South Asia; SA), this study investigates the main climate risks that farmers faced and the adaptation strategies they used. Among others, excessive rainfall and heightened crop pest/disease incidence are commonly observed climate-induced risks in all study areas, while cyclones and salinity are unique to Bangladesh. Drought is prevalent in Ethiopia, India, Kenya, and Nepal. Farmers in those countries responded with strategies that include change in farming practices, sustainable land management, reduce consumption, sell assets, use savings and borrowings, seek alternative employment and assistance from government or NGO. In general, farmers faced several multiple climate risks simultaneously and they responded with multiple adaptation strategies. Therefore, this study used a multivariate probit (MVP) approach to examine the factors influencing the adoption of adaptation strategies. Unlike other studies, we also tested and corrected for possible endogeneity in model estimation. All the countries mentioned have low adaptive capacity to address climate change, which is further weakened by inadequate governance and inefficient institutions. We observed significant differences in the choice of adaptation strategies between male-headed households (MHHs) and female-headed households (FHHs), as well as across countries. Generally, MHHs are more likely to seek additional employment and change agricultural practices, while FHHs and households headed by older persons tend to reduce consumption and rely on savings and borrowings. Institutional support for adaptation is much less in EA compared to SA. Training on alternative farming practices, enhancing non-farm employment options, better institutional support, and social security for older farmers are crucial for climate change adaptation in both regions.",,English,10.1038/s41598-021-89391-1,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21549,2021,Scientific Reports,Nature Publishing Group,,climate; risk; adaptation; agriculture
A high-resolution assessment of climate change impact on water footprints of cereal production in India,"Mali, S.S.; Shirsath, P.B.; Islam, A.","Water footprint (WF), a comprehensive indicator of water resources appropriation, has evolved as an efficient tool to improve the management and sustainability of water resources. This study quantifies the blue and green WF of major cereals crops in India using high resolution soil and climatic datasets. A comprehensive modelling framework, consisting of Evapotranspiration based Irrigation Requirement (ETIR) tool, was developed for WF assessment. For assessing climate change impact on WF, multi-model ensemble climate change scenarios were generated using the hybrid-delta ensemble method for RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 and future period of 2030s and 2050s. The total WF of the cereal crops are projected to change in the range of − 3.2 to 6.3% under different RCPs in future periods. Although, the national level green and blue WF is projected to change marginally, distinct trends were observed for Kharif (rainy season—June to September) and rabi (winter season—October to February) crops. The blue WF of paddy is likely to decrease by 9.6%, while for wheat it may increase by 4.4% under RCP4.5 during 2050s. The green WF of rabi crops viz. wheat and maize is likely to increase in the range of 20.0 to 24.1% and 9.9 to 16.2%, respectively. This study provides insights into the influences of climate change on future water footprints of crop production and puts forth regional strategies for future water resource management. In view of future variability in the WFs, a water footprint-based optimization for relocation of crop cultivation areas with the aim of minimising the blue water use would be possible management alternative.",,English,10.1038/s41598-021-88223-6,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21529,2021,Nature Scientific Reports,Nature Publishing Group,,climate change; water footprint; cereal crops
Spatial targeting of ICT-based weather and agro-advisory services for climate risk management in agriculture,"Gangopadhyay, P.K.; Khatri-Chhetri, A.; Shirsath, P.B.; Aggarwal, P.K.","The increasing frequency of climatic risks, such as flood, drought, heat and cold waves, is causing significant loss of farm productivity and income in agriculturally dependent communities. Timely availability of reliable information on weather conditions, agro-advisories, and market information can help to minimize losses in agriculture. This paper presents a scientific and integrated approach to identify areas of high agriculture vulnerability to climate change and availability of ICT services for dissemination of CSA information in the vulnerable areas. This study was illustrated for India where the majority of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihoods, and this sector is highly vulnerable to climate change. The study presents four regions: i) high agriculture vulnerability and low ICT services, ii) high agriculture vulnerability and high ICT services, iii) low agriculture vulnerability and low ICT services, and iv) low agriculture vulnerability and high ICT services. This methodology, which is simple, uses available data, and is easy to apply, can be useful to prioritize locations for climate-smart interventions, mode of CSA information dissemination using ICT services, and increase coverage of agro-ICT services through development of ICT services in the locations where climate change impact is high and ICT services are very low. This study also showed that there is a need to improve the quality of existing climate information and agro-advisory services in the climate risk-prone areas.",,English,10.1007/s10584-019-02426-5,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21531,2019,Climatic Change,Springer,241-256,weather hazards; risk; risk management; information and communication technologies (icts)
"Trade-offs between agricultural production, GHG emissions and income in a changing climate, technology, and food demand scenario","Shirsath, P.B.; Aggarwal, P.K.","Climate-smart agriculture targets integrated adaptation and mitigation strategies for delivering food security and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. This study outlines a methodology to identify the trade-offs between food production, emissions, and income under technology and food demand-shift scenario and climate change. The methodology uses Climate Smart Agricultural Prioritization (CSAP) toolkit a multi-objective land-use allocation model, and detailed databases, characterizing the agricultural production processes at the land-unit scale. A case study has also been demonstrated for Bihar, a state in India. The quantification of trade-offs demonstrates that under different technology growth pathways alone the food self-sufficiency for Bihar cannot be achieved whilst the reduction in emission intensity targets are achievable up to 2040. However, both food self-sufficiency and reduction in emission intensity can be achieved if we relax constraints on dietary demand and focus on kilo-calories maximization targets. The district-level analysis shows that food self-sufficiency and reduction in emission intensity targets can be achieved at a local scale through efficient crop-technology portfolios.",,English,10.3390/su13063190,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21530,2021,Sustainability,MDPI,,climate change adaptation; climate change mitigation; prioritization; climate-smart agriculture; optimization methods; adaptation; trade-offs
Quantifying opportunities for greenhouse gas emissions mitigation using big data from smallholder crop and livestock farmers across Bangladesh,"Sapkota, T.; Khanam, F.; Mathivanan, G.P.; Vetter, S.H.; Hussain,  S.G.; Pilat, A.L.; Sumona Shahrin; Hossain, M.K; Sarker, N.R.; Krupnik, T.J.","Climate change is and will continue to have significant implications for agricultural systems. While adaptation to climate change should be the priority for smallholder production systems, adoption of cost-effective mitigation options in agriculture not only contributes to food security but also reduces the extent of climate change and future adaptation needs. Utilizing management data from 16,413 and 12,548 crop and livestock farmers and associated soil and climatic data, we estimated GHG emissions generated from crop and livestock production using crop and livestock models, respectively. Mitigation measures in crop and livestock production, their mitigation potential and cost/benefit of adoption were then obtained from literature review, stakeholder consultations and expert opinion. We applied the identified mitigation measures to a realistic scale of adoption scenario in the short- (2030) and long-term (2050). Our results were then validated through stakeholders consultations. Here, we present identified mitigation options, their mitigation potentials and cost or benefit of adoption in the form of Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC). Based on our analysis, total GHG emissions from agricultural sector in Bangladesh for the year 2014–15 is 76.79 million tonne (Mt) carbon-dioxide equivalent (CO2e). Business-as-usual GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in Bangladesh are approximately 86.87 and 100.44 Mt CO2e year−1 by 2030 and 2050, respectively. Adoption of climate-smart crop and livestock management options to reduce emissions considering a realistic adoption scenario would offer GHG mitigation opportunities of 9.51 and 14.21 Mt CO2e year−1 by 2030 and 2050, respectively. Of this mitigation potential, 70–75% can be achieved through cost-saving options that could benefit smallholder farmers. Realization of this potential mitigation benefit, however, largely depends on the degree to which supportive policies and measures can encourage farmers' adoption of the identified climate smart agricultural techniques. Therefore, government should focus on facilitating uptake of these options through appropriate policy interventions, incentive mechanisms and strengthening agricultural extension programs.",,English,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147344,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21514,2021,Science of the Total Environment,Elsevier,,greenhouse gases; climate change; climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; data; climate-smart agriculture; adaptation; big data
Wheat root systems as a breeding target for climate resilience,"Ober, E.; Alahmad, S.; Cockram, J.; Forestan, C.; Hickey, L.; Kant, J.; Maccaferri, M.; Marr, E.; Milner, M.J.; Pinto Espinosa, F.; Rambla, C.; Reynolds, M.P.; Salvi, S.; Sciara, G.; Snowdon, R.J.; Thomelin, P.; Tuberosa, R.; Uauy, C.; Voss-Fels, K.P.; Wallington, E.J.; Watt, M.","In the coming decades, larger genetic gains in yield will be necessary to meet projected demand, and this must be achieved despite the destabilizing impacts of climate change on crop production. The root systems of crops capture the water and nutrients needed to support crop growth, and improved root systems tailored to the challenges of specific agricultural environments could improve climate resiliency. Each component of root initiation, growth and development is controlled genetically and responds to the environment, which translates to a complex quantitative system to navigate for the breeder, but also a world of opportunity given the right tools. In this review, we argue that it is important to know more about the ‘hidden half’ of crop plants and hypothesize that crop improvement could be further enhanced using approaches that directly target selection for root system architecture. To explore these issues, we focus predominantly on bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a staple crop that plays a major role in underpinning global food security. We review the tools available for root phenotyping under controlled and field conditions and the use of these platforms alongside modern genetics and genomics resources to dissect the genetic architecture controlling the wheat root system. To contextualize these advances for applied wheat breeding, we explore questions surrounding which root system architectures should be selected for, which agricultural environments and genetic trait configurations of breeding populations are these best suited to, and how might direct selection for these root ideotypes be implemented in practice.",,English,10.1007/s00122-021-03819-w,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21509,2021,Theoretical and Applied Genetics,Springer,1645-1662,root systems; wheat; climate change; resilience
Grand challenges for the 21st century: what crop models can and can't (yet) do,"Silva, J.V.; Giller, K.E.","Crop production is at the core of a 'perfect storm' encompassing the grand challenges of achieving food and nutrition security for all, in the face of climate change, while avoiding further conversion of natural habitats for agriculture and loss of biodiversity. Here, we explore current trends in crop modelling related to these grand challenges by reflecting on research presented at the Second International Crop Modelling Symposium (iCropM2020). A keyword search in the book of abstracts of the symposium revealed a strong focus on 'climate change', 'adaptation' and 'impact assessment' and much less on 'food security' or 'policy'. Most research focused on field-level investigations and far fewer on farm(ing) systems levels - the levels at which management decisions are made by farmers. Experimentation is key to development and testing of crop models, yet the term 'simulation' outweighed by far the terms 'experiments' and 'trials', and few contributions dealt with model improvement. Cereals are intensively researched, whereas roots, tubers and tropical perennials are under-researched. Little attention is paid to nutrient limitations apart from nitrogen or to pests and diseases. The aforementioned aspects represent opportunities for future research where crop models can help in devising hypotheses and driving new experimentation. We must also ensure that crop models are fit for their intended purposes, especially if they are to provide advice to policymakers. The latter, together with cross-scale and interdisciplinary efforts with direct engagement of stakeholders are needed to address the grand challenges faced by food and agricultural systems in the next century.",,English,10.1017/S0021859621000150,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21494,2020,The Journal of Agricultural Science,Cambridge University Press,794-805,climate change; farming systems; food security; research; research priorities
The crucial role of mulch to enhance the stability and resilience of cropping systems in southern Africa,"Mhlanga, B.; Ercoli, L.; Pellegrino, E.; Onofri, A.; Thierfelder, C.","Conservation agriculture has been promoted to sustainably intensify food production in smallholder farming systems in southern Africa. However, farmers have rarely fully implemented all its components, resulting in different combinations of no-tillage, crop rotation, and permanent soil cover being practiced, thus resulting in variable yield responses depending on climatic and soil conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the effect of conservation agriculture components on yield stability. We hypothesized that the use of all three conservation agriculture components would perform the best, resulting in more stable production in all environments. We evaluated at, eight trial locations across southern Africa, how partial and full implementation of these components affected crop yield and yield stability compared with conventional tillage alone or combined with mulching and/or crop rotation. Grain yield and shoot biomass of maize and cowpea were recorded along with precipitation for 2 to 5 years. Across different environments, the addition of crop rotation and mulch to no-tillage increased maize grain by 6%, and the same practices added to conventional tillage led to 13% yield increase. Conversely, adding only mulch or crop rotation to no-tillage or conventional tillage led to lower or equal maize yield. Stability analyses based on Shukla’s index showed for the first time that the most stable systems are those in which mulch is added without crop rotation. Moreover, the highest yielding systems were the least stable. Finally, additive main effects and multiplicative interaction analysis allowed clarifying that mulch added to no-tillage gives stable yields on sandy soil with high rainfall. Similarly, mulch added to conventional tillage gives stable yield on sandy soil, but under low rainfall. This is the first study that highlighted the crucial role of mulch to enhance the stability and resilience of cropping systems in southern Africa, supporting their adaptability to climate change.",,English,10.1007/s13593-021-00687-y,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21489,2021,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,Springer,,sustainable agriculture; zero tillage; conservation agriculture; yields; yield stability
"Effects of tillage, crop establishment and diversification on soil organic carbon, aggregation, aggregate associated carbon and productivity in cereal systems of semi-arid Northwest India","Jat, H.S.; Datta, A.; Choudhary, M.; Yadav, A.K.; Choudhary, V.; Sharma, P.C.; Gathala, M.K.; Jat, M.L.; Mcdonald, A.","Intensive tillage based management practices are threatening soil quality and systems sustainability in the rice-wheat belt of Northwest India. Furthermore, it is accentuated with puddling of soil, which disrupts soil aggregates. Conservation agriculture (CA) practices involving zero tillage, crop residue management and suitable crop rotation can serve as better alternative to conventional agriculture for maintaining soil quality. Soil organic carbon is an important determinant of soil quality, playing critical role in food production, mitigation and adaptation to climate change as well as performs many ecosystem functions. To understand the turnover of soil carbon in different forms (Total organic carbon-TOC; aggregate associated carbon-AAC; particulate organic carbon- POC), soil aggregation and crop productivity with different management practices, one conventional agriculture based scenario and three CA based crop management scenarios namely conventional rice-wheat system (Sc1), partial CA based rice-wheat-mungbean system (Sc2), full CA-based rice-wheat-mungbean system (Sc3) and maize-wheat-mungbean system (Sc4) were evaluated. TOC was increased by 71%, 68% and 25% after 4 years of the experiment and 75%, 80% and 38% after 6 years of the experiment in Sc4, Sc3 and Sc2, respectively, over Sc1 at 0?15 cm soil depth. After 4 years of the experiment, 38.5% and 5.0% and after 6 years 50.8% and 24.4% improvement in total water stable aggregates at 0?15 and 15?30 cm soil depth, respectively was observed in CA-based scenarios over Sc1. Higher aggregate indices were associated with Sc3 at 0?15 cm soil depth than others. Among the size classes of aggregates, highest aggregate associated C (8.94 g kg ?1 ) was retained in the 1-0.5 mm size class under CA-based scenarios. After 6 years, higher POC was associated with Sc4 (116%). CA-based rice/maize system (Sc3 and Sc4) showed higher productivity than Sc1. Therefore, CA could be a potential management practice in rice-wheat cropping system of Northwest India to improve the soil carbon pools through maintaining soil aggregation and productivity.",,English,10.1016/j.still.2019.03.005,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21486,2019,Soil and Tillage Research,Elsevier,128-138,soil organic carbon; crop production; crop management; arid zones; aggregate associated carbon; particulate organic carbon; crop productivity
Low-cost quantification of greenhouse gas emissions in smallholder agro-ecosystem: a comparative analysis of methods,"Sapkota, T.; Kapoor, P.; Jat, M.L.","Quantification of greenhouse gas (GHG) exchanges between agricultural field and the atmosphere is essential for understanding the contribution of various production systems to the total emissions, develop mitigation options and policies, raise awareness and encourage adoption. But, GHG quantification from smallholder agricultural landscape is challenging primarily because of the heterogeneity of production systems. Various methods have been developed over years to quantify GHG fluxes between agricultural ecosystem and atmosphere. In this paper, we reviewed and analysed the common methods with regard to their scale and precision of quantification, cost effectiveness, prospects and limitations focusing mainly on smallholder production systems. As most of the quantification methods depend on ground data and due to data deficit for smallholder systems, field measurement must be an essential part of GHG emission inventories under such systems. Chamber-based method is a principal approach for field level quantification under smallholder production system mainly because of its cost effectiveness, portability and adoptability under diverse field conditions. However, direct measurement of GHG for all mosaics of smallholder production landscape is impractical and therefore use of models becomes imperative. Here, selection of suitable models and their rigorous parameterization, calibration and validation under various production environments are necessary in order to obtain meaningful emission estimation. After proper validation, linking dynamic ecosystem models to geographic information system (GIS) helps estimating GHG emission within reasonable time and cost. Integration of different approaches such as chamber-based measurement to generate field data, simulation modelling by using empirical as well as process-based models coupled with use of satellite imagery may provide a robust estimate of GHGs emission than use of a single approach.",,English,,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21459,2015,International Journal of Agricultural Science and Research,Transstellar Journal Publications and Research Consultancy,31-44,greenhouse gases; smallholders; production systems; agriculture; climate change; modelling
Plant breeding for organic agriculture: something new?,"Crespo Herrera, L.A.; Ortiz, R.","The role of both organic (OF) and conventional (CF) farming remains open to debate particularly when related to food security and climate change. Targeting plant breeding for OF can contribute to reduce its yield gaps vis-à-vis CF. Currently, the cultivars produced for CF are also used in OF, however, it is unreasonable that all lines bred for CF will always perform well in OF. Nonetheless, plant breeding goals for OF and CF converge at aiming for high productiv‑ ity, host plant resistance or tolerance to biotic and abiotic factors, and high resource-use efficiency. Likewise end-use quality and local adaptation may be more important for OF as the resource recycling and quality of the inputs that are used vary from region to region, even though OF practices are highly regulated. This article provides an overview on organic plant breeding (OPB) with a perspective from conventional plant breeding, highlights the main traits, their source of variation, and what methods and tools are available for their breeding.

Effect of climate change and associated factors on the production and productivity of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) over last years in the Terai Region of Nepal,"Khet Raj Dahal; Ramesh Raj Puri; Joshi, A.K.","A study on the effect of climate change and associated factors on the production and productivity of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) over last 25 years in the Terai region of Nepal was conducted. Three major wheat growing districts of Nepal (Kanchanpur, Rupandehi and Dhanusha) were focused. Climate and wheat management data were deployed. Farmers' feedback was taken through a set of semi-structured questionnaire followed by one day workshop cum seminar. Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted in the field. Comparison over 25 years showed that rainfall during wheat season declined significantly while maximum temperature increased by over 10C. Mean minimum temperature showed slight decline. Farmers' interaction indicated that growth period of wheat appeared to reduce over years, while new diseases/races and weeds have emerged. This led to increase in use of chemical pesticides. Use of inputs such as chemical fertilizers increased significantly leading to increased production cost by many folds. Despite limitations, wheat farming area and production has increased significantly in the past 25 years. The major issues for farmers were found to be a deficit of inorganic fertilizers, insufficient supply of quality seeds and an unsystematic market. The coping mechanism for climate change in wheat farming in all the three districts was not applied due to lack of knowledge, facilities and access to improved technologies.

Maize landraces and adaptation to climate change in Mexico,"Hellin, J.; Bellon, M.; Hearne, S.","Mexico is the primary center of origin and diversity for maize (Zea mays L.). Farmers grow the crop largely under rain-fed conditions. Mexico is at considerable risk from climate change because of predicted rising temperatures, declining rainfall, and an increase in extreme weather events. Small-scale maize farmers are particularly vulnerable because of their geographical location as well as their limited adaptive capacity. Recommended climate change adaptation strategies include farmers? increased use of heat and drought stress-tolerant maize. Farmer adoption of improved germplasm has been disappointing because of inefficient seed input chains and farmers? preference for landraces for culinary, agronomic, and cultural reasons. Scientists have tended to overlook the fact that maize landraces have a critical role to play in climate change adaptation. Landraces may already exist that are appropriate for predicted climates. Furthermore, within the primary gene pool of maize and its wild relatives there exists unexploited genetic diversity for novel traits and alleles that can be used for breeding new high yielding and stress-tolerant cultivars. The breeding component of adaptation strategies should focus more on improving farmers? landraces. The desired result would be a segmented maize seed sector characterized by both (improved) landraces and improved maize varieties. The public and private sector could continue to provide farmers with improved maize varieties and different actors, including farmers themselves, would generate seed of improved landraces for sale and/or exchange.",,English,10.1080/15427528.2014.921800,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21445,2014,Journal of Crop Improvement,Taylor & Francis,484-501,climate change adaptation; seed systems; smallholders; land races; maize; small-scale farmers; wild relatives
Climate change and food security in the developing world: potential of maize and wheat research to expand options for adaptation and mitigation,"Hellin, J.; Shiferaw, B.; Cairns, J.E.; Reynolds, M.P.; Ortiz-Monasterio, I.; Banziger, M.; Sonder, K.; La Rovere, R.","Maize and wheat are two of the most important food crops worldwide. Together with rice, they provide 30% of the food calories to 4.5 billion people in almost 100 developing countries. Predictions suggest that climate change will reduce maize production globally by 3 to 10% by 2050 and wheat production in developing countries by 29 to 34%. This will coincide with a substantial increase in demand for maize and wheat due to rising populations. Maize and wheat research has a crucial role to play in enhancing adaptation to and mitigation of climate change while also enhancing food security. Crop varieties with increased tolerance to heat and drought stress and resistance to pests and diseases are critical for managing current climatic variability and for adaptation to progressive climate change. Furthermore, sustainable agronomic and resource management practices, such as conservation agriculture and improved nitrogen management can contribute to climate change mitigation. There is also a need for better policies and investments in infrastructure to facilitate technology adoption and adaptation. These include investments in irrigation, roads, storage facilities and improved access to markets. There is also a need for policy innovations for stabilizing prices, diversifying incomes, increasing farmer access to improved seeds and finance, and providing safety nets to enhance farmers? livelihood security.

"Linkage disequilibrium patterns, population structure and diversity analysis in a worldwide durum wheat collection including Argentinian genotypes","Roncallo, P.F.; Larsen, A.O.; Achilli, A.L.; Saint Pierre, C.; Gallo, C.A.; Dreisigacker, S.; Echenique, V.","Background: Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum Desf. Husn) is the main staple crop used to make pasta products worldwide. Under the current climate change scenarios, genetic variability within a crop plays a crucial role in the successful release of new varieties with high yields and wide crop adaptation. In this study we evaluated a durum wheat collection consisting of 197 genotypes that mainly comprised a historical set of Argentinian germplasm but also included worldwide accessions. Results: We assessed the genetic diversity, population structure and linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in this collection using a 35 K SNP array. The level of polymorphism was considered, taking account of the frequent and rare allelic variants. A total of 1547 polymorphic SNPs was located within annotated genes. Genetic diversity in the germplasm collection increased slightly from 1915 to 2010. However, a reduction in genetic diversity using SNPs with rare allelic variants was observed after 1979. However, larger numbers of rare private alleles were observed in the 2000–2009 period, indicating that a high reservoir of rare alleles is still present among the recent germplasm in a very low frequency. The percentage of pairwise loci in LD in the durum genome was low (13.4%) in our collection. Overall LD and the high (r2 > 0.7) or complete (r2 = 1) LD presented different patterns in the chromosomes. The LD increased over three main breeding periods (1915–1979, 1980–1999 and 2000–2020). Conclusions: Our results suggest that breeding and selection have impacted differently on the A and B genomes, particularly on chromosome 6A and 2A. The collection was structured in five sub-populations and modern Argentinian accessions (cluster Q4) which were clearly differentiated. Our study contributes to the understanding of the complexity of Argentinian durum wheat germplasm and to derive future breeding strategies enhancing the use of genetic diversity in a more efficient and targeted way.",,English,10.1186/s12864-021-07519-z,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21417,2021,BMC Genomics,BioMed Central,,hard wheat; genetic linkage; population structure; single nucleotide polymorphism; genetic diversity; alleles; linkage disequilibrium; rare alleles
Model comparison and quantification of nitrous oxide emission and mitigation potential from maize and wheat fields at a global scale,"Tesfaye, K.; Takele, R.; Sapkota, T.; Khatri-Chhetri, A.; Solomon, D.; Stirling, C.; Albanito, F.","Maize and wheat are major cereals that contribute two-thirds of the food energy intake globally. The two crops consume about 35% of the nitrogen (N) fertilizer used in agriculture and thereby contribute to fertilizer-induced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Thus, estimation of spatially disaggregated N2O emissions from maize and wheat fields on a global scale could be useful for identifying emission and mitigation hotspots. It could also be needed for prioritizing mitigation options consistent with location-specific production and environmental goals. N2O emission from four models (CCAFS-MOT, IPCC Tier-I, IPCC Tier-II and Tropical N2O) using a standard gridded dataset from global maize and wheat fields were compared and their performance evaluated using measured N2O emission data points (777 globally distributed datapoints). The models were used to quantify spatially disaggregated N2O emission and mitigation potential from maize and wheat fields globally and the values were compared. Although the models differed in their performance of capturing the level of measured N2O emissions, they produced similar spatial patterns of annual N2O emissions from maize and wheat fields. Irrespective of the models, predicted N2O emissions per hectare were higher in some countries in East and South Asia, North America, and Western Europe, driven mainly by higher N application rates. The study indicated a substantial N2O abatement potential if application of excess N in the maize and wheat systems is reduced without compromising the yield of the crops through technological and crop management innovations. N2O mitigation potential is higher in those countries and regions where N application rates and current N2O emissions are already high. The estimated mitigation potentials are useful for hotspot countries to target fertilizer and crop management as one of the mitigation options in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).",,English,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146696,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21416,2021,Science of the Total Environment,Elsevier,,nitrogen fertilizers; nitrous oxide; gas emissions; maize; climate change mitigation; wheat
Mayan traditional knowledge on weather forecasting: who contributes to whom in coping with climate change?,"Camacho Villa, T.C.; Martinez Cruz, T.E.; Ramírez-López, A.; Hoil-Tzuc, M.; Terán-Contreras, S.","Despite international commitments to integrate indigenous peoples and their Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in actions combating climate change, their inclusion remains limited. Integrating TEK with scientific knowledge has become particularly important in sectors such as agriculture, which both contributes to and is affected by climate change. While there is a general recognition that integrating TEK will contribute to climate change adaptation, agricultural interventions have made little progress in achieving this due to the assumption of a clear divide between TEK and scientific knowledge. This paper considers that knowledge integration is already occurring, but in contexts of economic, sociocultural, and political inequalities. We elaborate on the case of traditional weather forecasting methods used by Mayan indigenous farmers in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula to propose a social justice perspective for knowledge integration in climate change interventions. Using information from three studies conducted between 2016 and 2019, we first explain the importance of weather and traditional weather forecast methods for indigenous Mayan farmers. Later we describe in detail both these methods and their links with Mayan cosmology. Findings show how weather phenomena such as drought and hurricanes are main concerns for milpa farming. They illustrate the diversity of traditional short, medium, and long-term weather forecast methods based on observations from nature and the sky. Farmers also perform rituals that are related to their Mayan gods and goddess. As TEK not only defines agricultural calendars but also reproduces Mayan culture, we discuss what is needed for its integration into actions combating climate change.

The impact of climate smart agriculture on household welfare in smallholder integrated crop–livestock farming systems: evidence from Zimbabwe,"Mujeyi, A.; Mudhara, M.; Mutenje, M.","Background: Agriculture contributes significantly to the welfare of smallholder farmers, but it has become highly susceptible to climate change, due to its reliance on the increasingly erratic rainfall patterns. Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) offers important opportunities for enhancing food security and incomes through increased agriculture productivity. Technology evaluation through impact studies provides information on the effect of CSA on farmer welfare, thereby highlighting its potential in optimizing agriculture productivity. This paper analyses the impact of CSA adoption on food security and income of households, using cross-sectional survey data collected from 386 households across four districts in Zimbabwe. The analysis was done using the endogenous switching regression model which controls for selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity, a commonly used method in adoption impact analysis. Results: The study found several agricultural and socio-economic factors which affect adoption and food security. The econometric results show that the status of soil fertility in fields, distance to input and output markets, ownership of communication assets, and Total Livestock Units (TLU) have a significant impact on the decision of farmers to adopt CSA. The Average Treatment Effects on the Treated (ATT) and Average Treatment Effects on the Untreated (ATU) were found to be positive and significant for adopters and non-adopters, indicating that CSA adoption has had a significantly positive impact on the welfare of the farmers. An analysis of the outcomes revealed that the characteristics of farmers and farms, as well as market factors, significantly affect the welfare of households. The household income, with reference to the adoption of CSA, was significantly affected by factors such as the education of household head, labour size, TLU, and asset index. Food security was influenced by factors such as the education of household head, TLU, access to sanitation, and arable land size. Conclusions: The study concludes by giving policy recommendations centred on the access to inputs, sanitation, and encouraging investing in assets and TLU. The findings indicate that the adoption of CSA has a positive impact on the welfare of farmers. To exploit the full potential of these technologies, the study suggests that access to timely weather forecasts must be ensured, that sanitation must be promoted, and that incentives must be provided for agricultural input agro-dealers to decentralize to rural areas.",,English,10.1186/s40066-020-00277-3,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21333,2021,Agriculture & Food Security,BioMed Central,,household income; food security; regression analysis; endogenous switching regression
"Predicting the water requirement for rice production as affected by projected climate change in Bihar, India","Jha, R.K.; Kalita, P.K.; Cooke, R.A.; Kumar, P.; Davidson, P.C.; Jat, R.K.","Climate change is a well-known phenomenon all over the globe. The influence of projected climate change on agricultural production, either positive or negative, can be assessed for various locations. The present study was conducted to investigate the impact of projected climate change on rice’s production, water demand and phenology for the state of Bihar, India. Furthermore, this study assessed the irrigation water requirement to increase the rice production by 60%, for the existing current climate scenario and all the four IPCC climate change scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5) by the 2050s (2050–2059). Various management practices were used as adaptation methods to analyze the requirement of irrigation water for a 60% increase in rice production. The climate data obtained from the four General Circulation Models (GCMs) (bcc_csm1.1, csiro_mk3_6_0, ipsl_cm5a_mr and miroc_miroc5) were used in the crop growth model, with the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) used to simulate the rice yield, phenological days and water demand under all four climate change scenarios. The results obtained from the CERES-Rice model in the DSSAT, corresponding to all four GCMs, were ensembled together to obtain the overall change in yield, phenology and water demand for 10 years of interval from 2020 to 2059. We investigated several strategies: increasing the rice’s yield by 60% with current agronomic practice; increasing the yield by 60% with conservation agricultural practice; and increasing the rice yield by 30% with current agronomic practice as well as with conservation agricultural practices (assuming that the other 30% increase in yield would be achieved by reducing post-harvest losses by 30%). The average increase in precipitation between 2020 and 2059 was observed to be 5.23%, 13.96%, 9.30% and 9.29%, respectively, for RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5. The decrease in yield during the 2050s, from the baseline period (1980–2004), was observed to be 2.94%, 3.87%, 4.02% and 5.84% for RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The irrigation requirement was predicted to increase by a range of 39% to 45% for a 60% increase in yield using the current agronomic practice in current climate scenario and by 2050s with all the four climate change scenarios from the baseline period (1980–2004). We found that if we combine both conservation agriculture and removal of 30% of the post-harvest losses, the irrigation requirement would be reduced by 26% (45 to 19%), 20% (44 to 24%), 21% (43 to 22%), 22% (39 to 17%) and 20% (41 to 21%) with current climate scenario, RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 conditions, respectively. This combination of conservation practices suggests that the irrigation water requirement can be reduced by a large percentage, even if we produce 60% more food under the projected climate change conditions.",,English,10.3390/w12123312,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21313,2020,Water,MDPI,,water requirements; rice; crop production; phenology; food security; climate change; climate change scenarios
"The importance of the traditional milpa in food security and nutritional self-sufficiency in the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico","Novotny, I.P.; Tittonell, P.; Fuentes Ponce, M.; Lopez-Ridaura, S.; Rossing, W.A.H.","Around 30% of global food is produced by smallholder farmers, yet they constitute the most food-insecure group. In Mexico, food self-sufficiency is declining. Rural policies in the country have stimulated the production of cash crops to the detriment of the traditional intercropping system, the milpa. Such a decline may have negative consequences for the food security of subsistence farmers. This study aimed to assess changes in nutritional self-sufficiency over the last 30 years and the role of milpa systems in food security for two communities in the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico. The study used satellite images, censuses, and field data to estimate food production. Three cropping systems, monoculture of maize, monoculture of common bean, and the milpa were compared in terms of nutrients and vitamins produced. Furthermore, a household typology was developed for each community to contrast nutritional self-sufficiency levels between the different household types. Results showed that the milpa produced more volume of food per area compared to the other systems. The milpa also produced all the nutrients and vitamins (except for B12) required to feed at least 2 persons ha-1. Monocultures of maize lacked vitamins A, B9, B12, and C, and the common bean lacked vitamins A, B12, and C. While farmers recognized the importance of the milpa, they preferred monocultures due to the reduced labor demands of this system. Households that obtained most of their income from off-farm activities had the lowest nutritional self-sufficiency. Enhancing nutritional self-sufficiency through crop diversification has the potential to not only improve the nutrition of subsistence farmers, but also to enhance ecosystem service provision, promote biodiversity conservation and restoration, and improve resilience to climate change.",,English,10.1371/journal.pone.0246281,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21291,2021,PLoS ONE,Public Library of Science,,food security; crops; beans; cereal crops; maize; nutrients; vitamins
Combining local knowledge and soil science for integrated soil health assessments in conservation agriculture systems,"Hermans, T.D.G.; Dougill, A.J.; Whitfield, S.; Peacock, C.L.; Eze, S.; Thierfelder, C.","The challenges of soil degradation and climate change have led to the emergence of Conservation Agriculture (CA) as a sustainable alternative to tillage-based agriculture systems. Despite the recognition of positive impacts on soil health, CA adoption in Africa has remained low. Previous soil health studies have mainly focused on ‘scientific’ measurements, without consideration of local knowledge, which influences how farmers interpret CA impacts and future land management decisions. This study, based in Malawi, aims to 1) combine local knowledge and conventional soil science approaches to develop a contextualised understanding of the impact of CA on soil health; and 2) understand how an integrated approach can contribute to explaining farmer decision-making on land management. Key farmers' indicators of soil health were crop performance, soil consistence, moisture content, erosion, colour, and structure. These local indicators were consistent with conventional soil health indicators. By combining farmers' observations with soil measurements, we observed that CA improved soil structure, moisture (Mwansambo 7.54%–38.15% lower for CP; Lemu 1.57%–47.39% lower for CP) and infiltration (Lemu CAM/CAML 0.15 cms−1, CP 0.09 cms−1; Mwansambo CP/CAM 0.14 cms−1, CAML 0.18 cms−1). In the conventional practice, farmers perceived ridges to redistribute nutrients, which corresponded with recorded higher exchangeable ammonium (Lemu CP 76.0 mgkg −1, CAM 49.4 mgkg −1, CAML 51.7 mgkg −1), nitrate/nitrite values (Mwansambo CP 200.7 mgkg −1, CAM 171.9 mgkg −1, CAML 103.3 mgkg −1). This perception contributes to the popularity of ridges, despite the higher yield measurements under CA (Mwansambo CP 3225 kgha-1, CAML 5067 kgha-1, CAM 5160 kgha-1; Lemu CP 2886 kgha-1, CAM 2872 kgha-1, CAML 3454 kgha-1 ). The perceived carbon benefits of residues and ridge preference has promoted burying residues in ridges. Integrated approaches contribute to more nuanced and localized perceptions about land management. We propose that the stepwise integrated soil assessment framework developed in this study can be applied more widely in understanding the role of soil health in farmer-decision making, providing a learning process for downscaling technologies and widening the evidence base on sustainable land management practices.",,English,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112192,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21290,2021,Journal of Environmental Management,Elsevier,,climate-smart agriculture; zero tillage; soil; local knowledge; soil health
Food security and the dynamics of wheat and maize value chains in Africa and Asia,"Grote, U.; Fasse, A.; Trung Thanh Nguyen; Erenstein, O.","There is an ongoing debate about how best to feed the growing world population in the long run and associated implications for research and development. Some call for a new Green Revolution to secure the supply of staple foods, whereas others emphasize the importance of diversifying and improving people's diets. We aim to contribute to this debate by reviewing the case of wheat and maize value chains and their contribution to food security in Africa and Asia. We first identify drivers transforming food systems. We then apply these to the cereal value chains and disentangle their effects on food security. We thereby add to the three strands in the literature around production, consumption, and food system transformation and point to different research needs and recommendations for the future. The review highlights: (1) Wheat and maize production will be increasingly impaired by ecological drivers such as land degradation, water scarcity and climate change. (2) There are promising innovations to increase and maintain productivity, but constraints in adopting these innovations have to be overcome (i.e., access to seeds, finance, and education/training). (3) The drivers affect all four dimensions of food security, but first and foremost they determine the availability and stability of maize and wheat. This indirectly also influences the economic and physical access of people to maize and wheat. (4) Research tends to focus on improving the productivity and sustainability of wheat and maize farming which is largely interlinked with the availability dimension of food security. (5) The stability and utilization dimension of food security merits continued yet increased support. First, to address climate change and implications for biotic and abiotic stresses. Second, to promote healthier diets and enable the equitable transformation of food systems.",,English,10.3389/fsufs.2020.617009,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21287,2021,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,Frontiers,,cereals; uses; stability; food production; transformation; global food production; drivers

Identification of heat tolerant hybrids based on morphological traits and selection indices,"Longmei, N.; Gill, G.K.; Kumar, R.; Zaidi, P.; Pal, L.","Development of climate resilient cultivars is necessary for maize production as increased temperature have negative impact on maize yield. Selection based on grain yield along with stress-adaptive secondary traits could help in the development of improved, stable heat stress tolerant cultivars. The current study was conducted to identify reliable and effective secondary traits associated with heat stress tolerance in tropical maize. A Six hundred and sixty two double haploid lines derived from nine bi-parental pedigree populations were phenotyped under natural heat stress and optimal condition. Evaluation was carried out under optimal and natural heat stress condition by sowing on 1st week of February and March to expose the reproductive stages and grain filling period during heat stress.

One of the major challenges with climate change is the uncertainty and inter-annual variability in weather conditions as crops are frequently exposed to different weather extremes within the same season. Therefore, agricultural research must strive to develop new crop varieties with inbuilt resilience towards variable weather conditions rather than merely tolerance to individual stresses in a specific situation and/or at a specific crop stage. C4 crops are known for their wider adaptation to range of climatic conditions. However, recent climatic trends and associated variabilities seem to be challenging the threshold limit of wider adaptability of even C4 crops like maize. In collaboration with national programs and private sector partners in the region, CIMMYT-Asia maize program initiated research for development (R4D) projects largely focusing on saving achievable yields across range of variable environments by incorporating reasonable levels of tolerance/resistance to major abiotic and biotic stresses without compromising on grain yields under optimal growing conditions. By integrating novel breeding tools like - genomics, double haploid (DH) technology, precision phenotyping and reducing genotype × environment interaction effects, a new generation of maize germplasm with multiple stress tolerance that can grow well across variable weather conditions were developed. The new maize germplasm were targeted for stress-prone environments where maize is invariability exposed to a range of sub-optimal growing conditions, such as drought, heat, waterlogging and various virulent diseases.

We evaluated Nutrient Expert (NE) tool-based site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) in rice and wheat crops by establishing 1594 side-by-side comparison trials with farmers’ fertilization practices (FFP) across the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of India. We found that NE-based fertilizer management can lower global warming potential (GWP) by about 2.5% in rice, and between 12 and 20% in wheat over FFP. More than 80% of the participating farmers increased their crop yield and farm income by applying the NE-based fertilizer recommendation. We also observed that increased crop yield and reduced fertilizer consumption and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by using NE was significantly influenced by the crop type, agro-ecology, soil properties and farmers’ current level of fertilization. Adoption of NE-based fertilizer recommendation practice in all rice and wheat acreage in India would translate into 13.92 million tonnes (Mt) more rice and wheat production with 1.44 Mt less N fertilizer use, and a reduction in GHG of 5.34 Mt CO2e per year over farmers’ current practice.

In this region, maize landraces are fundamental for food security, livelihoods, and culture. Nevertheless, genetic erosion (i.e., the loss of genetic diversity and variation in a crop) threatens the continued cultivation and in situ conservation of landrace diversity that is crucial to climate change adaptation and diverse uses of maize. We provide an overview of maize diversity in Latin America before discussing factors associated with persistence of large in situ maize diversity, causes for maize landrace abandonment by farmers, and strategies to enhance the cultivation of landraces. Among other factors, maize diversity is linked with: (1) small-holder farming, (2) the production of traditional food products, (3) traditional cropping systems, (4) cultivation in marginal areas, and (5) retention of control over the production system by the farmers. On the other hand, genetic erosion is associated with substitution of landraces with hybrid varieties or cash crops, and partial (off-farm labor) or complete migration to urban areas. Continued cultivation, and therefore on-farm conservation of genetic diversity held in maize landraces, can be encouraged by creating or strengthening market opportunities that make the cultivation of landraces and open pollinated varieties (OPVs) more profitable for farmers, supporting breeding programs that prioritize improvement of landraces and their special traits, and increasing the access to quality germplasm of landraces and landrace-derived OPVs.",,English,10.3390/agronomy11010172,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21140,2021,Agronomy,MDPI,,agrobiodiversity; genetic erosion; maize; plant breeding; land races; open pollination; plant genetic resources; value chains; maize races; open pollinated varieties; on farm conservation

From over half a million plant species, cereals and legumes are the most important for food and nutritional security. Although systematic plant breeding has a relatively short history, conventional breeding coupled with advances in technology and crop management strategies has increased crop yields by 56 % globally between 1965−85, referred to as the Green Revolution. Nevertheless, increased demand for food, feed, fiber, and fuel necessitates the need to break existing yield barriers in many crop plants. In the first decade of the 21st century we witnessed rapid discovery, transformative technological development and declining costs of genomics technologies. In the second decade, the field turned towards making sense of the vast amount of genomic information and subsequently moved towards accurately predicting gene-to-phenotype associations and tailoring plants for climate resilience and global food security. In this review we focus on genomic resources, genome and germplasm sequencing, sequencing-based trait mapping, and genomics-assisted breeding approaches aimed at developing biotic stress resistant, abiotic stress tolerant and high nutrition varieties in six major cereals (rice, maize, wheat, barley, sorghum and pearl millet), and six major legumes (soybean, groundnut, cowpea, common bean, chickpea and pigeonpea). We further provide a perspective and way forward to use genomic breeding approaches including marker-assisted selection, marker-assisted backcrossing, haplotype based breeding and genomic prediction approaches coupled with machine learning and artificial intelligence, to speed breeding approaches.

Climate impact and adaptation to heat and drought stress of regional and global wheat production,"Pequeno, D.N.L.; Hernandez-Ochoa, I.M.; Reynolds, M.P.; Sonder, K.; Molero Milan, A.; Robertson, R.; da Silva Sabino Lopes, M.; Wei Xiong; Kropff, Martinus; Asseng, S.","Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is the most widely grown food crop in the world threatened by future climate change. In this study, we simulated climate change impacts and adaptation strategies for wheat globally using new crop genetic traits (CGT), including increased heat tolerance, early vigor to increase early crop water use, late flowering to reverse an earlier anthesis in warmer conditions, and the combined traits with additional nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications, as an option to maximize genetic gains. These simulations were completed using three wheat crop models and five Global Climate Models (GCM) for RCP 8.5 at mid-century. Crop simulations were compared with country, US state, and US county grain yield and production. Wheat yield and production from high-yielding and low-yielding countries were mostly captured by the model ensemble mean. However, US state and county yields and production were often poorly reproduced, with large variability in the models, which is likely due to poor soil and crop management input data at this scale. Climate change is projected to decrease global wheat production by -1.9% by mid-century. However, the most negative impacts are projected to affect developing countries in tropical regions. The model ensemble mean suggests large negative yield impacts for African and Southern Asian countries where food security is already a problem. Yields are predicted to decline by -15% in African countries and -16% in Southern Asian countries by 2050. Introducing CGT as an adaptation to climate change improved wheat yield in many regions, but due to poor nutrient management, many developing countries only benefited from adaptation from CGT when combined with additional N fertilizer. As growing conditions and the impact from climate change on wheat vary across the globe, region-specific adaptation strategies need to be explored to increase the possible benefits of adaptations to climate change in the future.",,English,10.1088/1748-9326/abd970,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21118,2021,Environmental Research Letters,IOP Publishing,,wheat; crop production; climate change; heat stress; drought stress

However, the evidence of agroecology's contribution to sustainability remains fragmented because of heterogeneous methods and data, differing scales and timeframes, and knowledge gaps. Facing these challenges, 70 representatives of agroecology-related organizations worldwide participated in the development of the Tool for Agroecology Performance Evaluation (TAPE), to produce and consolidate evidence on the multidimensional performances of agroecological systems. TAPE is composed of: Step 0, the preliminary step that includes a description of the main socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the agricultural and food systems and an analysis of the enabling environment in terms of relevant policy, market, technology, socio-cultural and/or historical drivers; Step 1, the Characterization of Agroecological Transitions (CAET), based on the 10 Elements of Agroecology adopted by FAO and its member countries, using descriptive scales to establish scores and assessing the degree of transition, with information from the farm/household and community/territory scale; Step 2, the Core Criteria of Performance listing the key dimensions considered relevant to address the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Environment & climate change; Health & nutrition; Society & culture; Economy and Governance. Finally Step 3, a participatory validation of the results obtained from the previous steps with the producers and relevant stakeholders. TAPE can be used (i) to assess the extent of agroecological transition among agricultural producers in a community or a territory, (ii) to monitor and evaluate projects by characterizing the initial and subsequent steps in an agroecological transition, and/or (iii) to evaluate widely diverse agricultural systems against agroecological elements and how they contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Its application can support the transition of all forms of agricultural systems toward more sustainable practices and the formulation of adequate policies to enable this transformation. Preliminary results from pilot applications show that TAPE can perform in a variety of geographic regions and agroecosystems and that it allows assessment of performances of various criteria that move beyond classic indicators to begin to build a global evidence base for agroecology and support transformation to sustainable agricultural production and food systems.",,English,10.3389/fsufs.2020.579154,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21114,2020,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,Frontiers,,agroecology; sustainability; indicators; farms; territory; participatory approaches; sustainability assessment framework; multicriteria evaluation; participatory process

All livestock systems had alternative options available to reduce agro-environmental trade-offs, including reducing ruminant numbers, replacing local cattle with improved dairy breeds, improving feeding through on-farm forage cultivation, and minimizing crop residue feeding. Three obstacles to adoption of these technologies became apparent: they require a skillful re-organization of the entire production system, result in loss of some multi-functionality of livestock, and incur higher production risks. Sustainable livestock intensification can be a key building block to Tanzania's climate-smart agriculture portfolio, providing synergies between productivity and income increases, and climate change mitigation as co-benefit. A better understanding of the institutional settings, incentives and coordination between stakeholders is needed to sustainably transform the livestock sector.",,English,10.1080/14735903.2019.1695348,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21112,2020,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,Taylor and Francis,35-54,climate-smart agriculture; livestock feeding; ex ante impact assessment; bioeconomic models; households; improved livestock feeding; bioeconomic household modelling
Why we should rethink ‘adoption’ in agricultural innovation: empirical insights from Malawi,"Hermans, T.D.G.; Whitfield, S.; Dougill, A.J.; Thierfelder, C.","The challenges of land degradation, climate change and food insecurity have led to the introduction of conservation agriculture (CA) aimed at enhancing yield and soil quality. Despite positive biophysical results, low adoption rates have been the focus of studies identifying constraints to wider uptake. While the adoption framework is popular for measuring agricultural innovation, objective adoption measurements remain problematic and do not recognize the contextual and dynamic decision-making process. This study uses a technographic and participatory approach to move beyond the adoption framework and understand: (a) how agricultural decision-making takes place including the knowledge construction, (b) how agriculture is performed in a context of project intervention and (c) how practice adaptation plays out in the context of interacting knowledge. Findings confirm that farmer decision-making is dynamic, multidimensional and contextual. The common innovation diffusion model uses a theory of change, showcasing benefits through training lead farmers as community advocates and demonstration trials. Our study shows that the assumed model of technology transfer with reference to climate-smart agriculture interventions is not as linear and effective as assumed previously. We introduce four lenses that contribute to better understanding complex innovation dynamics: (a) social dynamics and information transfer, (b) contextual costs and benefits, (c) experience and risk aversion, and (d) practice adaptation. Investments should build on existing knowledge and farming systems including a focus on the dynamic decision process to support the 'scaling up, scaling out and scaling deep' agenda for sustainable agricultural innovations.",,English,10.1002/ldr.3833,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21072,2021,Land Degradation and Development,Wiley,1809-1820,climate-smart agriculture; conservation agriculture; zero tillage; no-tillage; scaling

Being able to access and share this data in standard formats is essential. The adoption of a common informatics platform for crops that may have limited resources brings economies of scale, allowing common informatics components to be used across multiple species. The close integration of such a platform with commonly used breeding software, visualization, and analysis tools reduces the barrier for entry to researchers and provides a common framework to facilitate collaborations and data sharing. This work presents significant updates to the Germinate platform and highlights its value in distributing prebreeding data for 14 crops as part of the project ‘Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change: Collecting, Protecting and Preparing Crop Wild Relatives’ (hereafter Crop Trust Crop Wild Relatives project) led by the Crop Trust (https://www.cwrdiversity.org). The addition of data on these species compliments data already publicly available in Germinate. We present a suite of updated Germinate features using examples from these crop species and their wild relatives. The use of Germinate within the Crop Trust Crop Wild Relatives project demonstrates the usefulness of the system and the benefits a shared informatics platform provides.

Gendered impacts of greenhouse gas mitigation options for rice cultivation in India,"Gartaula, H.; Sapkota, T.; Khatri-Chhetri, A.; Prasad, G.; Badstue, L.B.","The nexus of gender-agriculture-emissions reduction is one of the least explored areas related to agriculture and climate change. This nexus plays an important role in the areas where women’s participation in agriculture is high, and the contribution of the agricultural sector to total emission is significant. This study generates evidence on women’s labor contribution in rice cultivation and potential reduction of their labor drudgery, including GHG mitigation co-benefits with the adoption of direct seeding and machine transplanting technologies. Using a large number of plot-level data (11,987 data points) from the rice-growing regions of India, the study shows that changing rice production technology from conventional to direct-seeded rice (DSR) and/or machine-transplanted rice (MTR) offers huge potential to reduce women’s labor in rice planting (745 million labor-days for DSR and 610 million labor-days for MTR) and greenhouse gases (GHG) emission (34 MtCO2e for DSR and 7 MtCO2e for MTR) at the same time. This potential differs from the agro-ecological region, the level of input use, and women’s involvement in rice cultivation. The realization of this gender-responsive GHG mitigation strategy depends on the adoption of these technologies, which rely on several social, economic, and political factors. At the same time, the immense potential for negative implications for some specific groups should not be ignored, but focused on addressing and mitigating those challenges.",,English,10.1007/s10584-020-02941-w,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21049,2020,Climatic Change,Springer,1045-1063,climate change; gender; climate change mitigation; rice; gender-responsive mitigation; co-benefits; rice cultivation
Climate change has increased genotype-environment interactions in wheat breeding,"Wei Xiong; Reynolds, M.P.; Crossa, J.; Payne, T.S.; Schulthess, U.; Sonder, K.; Addimando, N.; Singh, R.P.; Ammar, K.; Gerard, B.","The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) develops and distributes annually elite wheat lines as international trials worldwide to assess their performance in different environments and utilization by partners for use in breeding or release as varieties. However, as elsewhere, the collaborator test sites where trials are evaluated have experienced climate change, with implications for how adapted wheat genotypes are bred. Using a standard quantitative genetic model and archived datasets for four global spring wheat trials, we show that the genotype-environment-interaction (GEI) has increased by up to 500% over recent decades. Notably crossover has increased over time, a critical indicator of changes in the ranking of cultivar performance in different environments. Climatic factors explain over 70% of the year-to-year variability in GEI and crossover interactions for yield. Examining yield responses of all genotypes in all trial environments from 1985 to 2017 reveals that climate change has increased GEI by ~ 49% and ranking change by ~38%. Genetic improvement of wheat targeted to high-yielding environments has exacerbated this increase, but the performance of new wheat germplasm developed to withstand heat and drought stress is more adapted and stable, offsetting the increase in ranking changes due to the warmer climate.",,English,10.21203/rs.3.rs-69475/v1,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21039,2020,Research Square,Research Square,,climate change; wheat; genotype environment interaction
Karnal bunt: a re-emerging old foe of wheat,"Bishnoi, S.K.; Xinyao He; Phuke, R.M.; Kashyap, P.L.; Alakonya, A.; Chhokar, V.; Singh, R.P.; Singh, P.K.","Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop health assumes unprecedented significance in being the second most important staple crop of the world. It is host to an array of fungal pathogens attacking the plant at different developmental stages and accrues various degrees of yield losses owing to these. Tilletia indica that causes Karnal bunt (KB) disease in wheat is one such fungal pathogen of high quarantine importance restricting the free global trade of wheat besides the loss of grain yield as well as quality. With global climate change, the disease appears to be shifting from its traditional areas of occurrence with reports of increased vulnerabilities of new areas across the continents. This KB vulnerability of new geographies is of serious concern because once established, the disease is extremely difficult to eradicate and no known instance of its complete eradication using any management strategy has been reported yet. The host resistance to KB is the most successful as well as preferred strategy for its mitigation and control. However, breeding of KB resistant wheat cultivars has proven to be not so easy, and the low success rate owes to the scarcity of resistance sources, extremely laborious and regulated field screening protocols delaying identification/validation of putative resistance sources, and complex quantitative nature of resistance with multiple genes conferring only partial resistance. Moreover, given a lack of comprehensive understanding of the KB disease epidemiology, host-pathogen interaction, and pathogen evolution. Here, in this review, we attempt to summarize the progress made and efforts underway toward a holistic understanding of the disease itself with a specific focus on the host-pathogen interaction between T. indica and wheat as key elements in the development of resistant germplasm. In this context, we emphasize the tools and techniques being utilized in development of KB resistant germplasm by illuminating upon the genetics concerning the host responses to the KB pathogen including a future course.

Combining yield potential and drought resilience in a spring wheat diversity panel,"Griffiths, C.A.; Reynolds, M.P.; Paul, M.J.","Pressures of population growth and climate change require the development of resilient higher yielding crops, particularly to drought. A spring wheat diversity panel was developed to combine high‐yield potential with resilience. To assess performance under drought, which in many environments is intermittent and dependent on plant development, 150 lines were grown with drought imposed for 10 days either at jointing or at anthesis stages in Obregon, Mexico. Both drought treatments strongly reduced grain numbers compared with the fully irrigated check. Best performers under drought at jointing had more grain than poor performers, while best performers under drought at anthesis had larger grain than poor performers. Most high‐yielding lines were high yielding in one drought environment only. However, some of the best‐performing lines displayed yield potential and resilience across two environments (28 lines), particularly for yield under well‐watered and drought at jointing, where yield was most related to grain numbers. Strikingly, only three lines were high yielding across all three environments, and interestingly, these lines had high grain numbers. Among parameters measured in leaves and grain, leaf relative water content did not correlate with yield, and proline was negatively correlated with yield; there were small but significant relationships between leaf sugars and yield. This study provides a valuable resource for further crosses and for elucidating genes and mechanisms that may contribute to grain number and grain filling conservation to combine yield potential and drought resilience.",,English,10.1002/fes3.241,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/21030,2020,Food and Energy Security,Wiley Open Access,,drought; genetic diversity; grain; resilience; wheat; yield potential; grain size and number

Here we present a scoping review, using PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols), examining the conditions that have led to the adoption of climate-resilient crops over the past 30 years in lower- and middle-income countries. The descriptive analysis performed on 202 papers shows that small-scale producers adopted climate-resilient crops and varieties to cope with abiotic stresses such as drought, heat, flooding and salinity. The most prevalent trait in our dataset was drought tolerance, followed by water-use efficiency. Our analysis found that the most important determinants of adoption of climate-resilient crops were the availability and effectiveness of extension services and outreach, followed by education levels of heads of households, farmers’ access to inputs—especially seeds and fertilizers—and socio-economic status of farming families. About 53% of studies reported that social differences such as sex, age, marital status and ethnicity affected the adoption of varieties or crops as climate change-adaptation strategies.

The present study focused on a longitudinal analysis of 10 years of data from the trial to better understand the joint effects of variations between the seasons and particular contrasts among treatments on yield of maize. Of further interest was the variability of treatment responses in time and space and the implications for design of future trials with adequate statistical power. The analysis shows treatment differences of the mean effect which vary according to cropping season. There was a strong treatment effect between rotational treatments and other treatments and a weak effect between intercropping and monocropping. There was no evidence for an overall advantage of systems where residues are retained (in combination with direct seeding or planting basins) over conventional management with respect to maize yield. A season effect was evident although the strong benefit of rotation in El Niño season was also reduced, highlighting the strong interaction between treatment and climatic conditions. The power analysis shows that treatment effects of practically significant magnitude may be unlikely to be detected with just four replicates, as at Chitedze, under either a simple randomised control trial or a factorial experiment. Given logistical and financial constraints, it is important to design trials with fewer treatments but more replicates to gain enough statistical power and to pay attention to the selection of treatments to given an informative outcome.",,English,10.1017/S0014479720000125,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20938,2020,Experimental Agriculture,Cambridge University Press,506-527,climate-smart agriculture; diversification; sustainable agriculture; zero tillage
Zero-tillage wheat provides stable yield and economic benefits under diverse growing season climates in the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains,"Keil, A.; Mitra, A.; Mcdonald, A.; Malik, R.","Sustainably enhancing wheat productivity in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) is vital for ensuring future food security. While in controlled field trials zero-tillage (ZT) wheat has demonstrated considerable yield benefits, empirical assessments of the performance stability of the practice in farmers’ fields under varying climatic conditions are lacking. Given progressive climate change, this constitutes an important knowledge gap which we address with a unique panel dataset from 961 farm households in Bihar, India, spanning two favourable and two less favourable growing seasons. We employ an endogenous switching regression (ESR) framework to derive unbiased estimates of the expected impacts of ZT on wheat yields and production costs among the farming population (average treatment effect, ATE). The prevailing ZT practices led to significant yield gains in three out of the four years, notably in the less favourable seasons. Overall, the estimated yield ATE was 660 kg ha−1. More importantly from the farmers’ perspective, ZT led to significant cost savings in all four seasons, commensurate to a 5% increase in average total household incomes. We conclude that ZT for wheat in Bihar provides tangible and consistent benefits to farmers.

Climate trends and variability at adaptation scale: patterns and perceptions in an agricultural region of the Ethiopian Highlands,"Ademe, D.; Ziatchik, B.F.; Tesfaye, K.; Belay Simane; Alemayehu, G.; Adgo, E.","Analysis of climate variability and trends frequently takes place at large scale. For agricultural applications, however, highly localized climate conditions can be critically important. This certainly applies to tropical highland regions, where dissected topography and convectively dominated precipitation processes can lead to strong variability in both mean climate conditions and year-to-year climate variability. This study examines recent climate variability and trends (1981–2016) on Choke Mountain, located in the western Ethiopian Highlands. Through analysis of precipitation and temperature records at monitored locations, we explore observed variability in climate patterns and trends across sites and seasons. The lens for our spatial analysis is the agroecosystem (AES), defined on the basis of prevailing climate and cropping systems, which currently serve as the foundation for climate adaptation planning in the region. We find that interannual temperature variability is greatest in the hottest, driest AES, and is most pronounced in the dry season. All AES warmed significantly in all seasons over the analysis period, but the magnitude of trend was greatest in high elevation AES. Precipitation variability was also large across AES, with largest interannual variability found in the dry season. This season is frequently excluded in climate analyses, but it is a critical harvest time and irrigation period. Trends in rainfall anomaly and precipitation concentration index are less clear, but there is a tendency towards drying and increasing irregularity of rainfall. Interestingly, we find little association between the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and temperature or precipitation variability at our study sites. This suggests that even though ENSO is a widely recognized driver of large-scale rainfall variability in the region, its impacts are highly spatially variable. This has implications for applying ENSO-based precipitation outlooks to agricultural management decisions.

Major climate risks and adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers in coastal Bangladesh,"Aryal, J.P.; Sapkota, T.; Rahut, D.B.; Krupnik, T.J.; Sumona Shahrin; Jat, M.L.; Stirling, C.","Rural households in South Asia’s coastal deltas face numerous livelihood challenges, including risks posed by climatic variability and extreme weather events. This study examines major climate risks, farmers’ adaptation strategies, and the factors affecting the choice of those strategies using data collected from 630 households in southwestern coastal Bangladesh. Farmers identified cyclones, excessive rain and flooding, and salinity as direct climate risks. Increased crop diseases/pests and livestock diseases were perceived as indirect risks resulting from climatic variability. Farmers used multiple adaptation strategies against those risks such as modifications in farm management, use of savings and borrowing funds from family and neighbors, and periodically reducing household food consumption. Off-farm employment and seeking assistance from governmental as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were also common adaptation strategies. The results show that male-headed households are more likely to change farming practices and reduce consumption compared with female-headed households that conversely tended to take assistance from NGOs as an adaptation strategy. Ownership of land and livestock, as well as farmers’ prior exposure to climate change and educational training, also had a significant effect on the choice of adaptation strategy. Therefore, development interventions and policies that aimed at improving resource endowment and training to farmers on climatic risks and their adaptation strategies can help minimize the impact of climatic risks.",,English,10.1007/s00267-020-01291-8,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20868,2020,Environmental Management,Springer,105-120,gender; climate change adaptation; risk; smallholders

Impacts of conservation agriculture on soil structure and hydraulic properties of Malawian agricultural systems,"Eze, S.; Dougill, A.J.; Banwart, S.A.; Hermans, T.D.G.; Ivy Sichinga Ligowe; Thierfelder, C.","Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) faces climate change and food insecurity challenges, which require action to create resilient farming systems. Conservation agriculture (CA) is widely promoted across SSA but the impacts on key soil physical properties and functions such as soil structure and hydraulic properties that govern water storage and transmission are not well understood. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of long term (10–12 years) maize-based CA on soil hydraulic conductivity, water retention and pore size distribution. Root zone (0–30 cm depth) soil total porosity, pore size distribution, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and plant available water capacity (PAWC) of conventional maize monocrop farming systems (CP) are compared with those of adjacent CA trials with either sole maize or maize intercrop/rotation with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.) or velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens L) in trial locations across central and southern Malawi. Results show that maize-based CA systems result in significant changes to soil hydraulic properties that correlate with improved soil structure. Results demonstrate increases of 5–15 % in total porosity, 0.06−0.22 cm/min in Ksat, 3–7 % in fine pores for water storage and 3–6 % in PAWC. Maize monocrop CA had similar effect on the hydraulic properties as the maize-legume associations. The values of Ksat for CA systems were within optimum levels (0.03–0.3 cm/min) whereas PAWC was below optimum (<20 %). There was no significant build-up in soil organic matter (OM) in the CA systems. The results lead to a recommendation that crop residue management should be more pro-actively pursued in CA guidance from agricultural extension staff to increase soil OM levels, increase yields and enhance climate resilience of sub-Saharan African farming systems.",,English,10.1016/j.still.2020.104639,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20828,2020,Soil and Tillage Research,Elsevier,,conservation agriculture; soil structure; soil water retention; porosity; dry spells; resilience

But, the question remains ‘to what extent can breeding gains be achieved under a changing climate, at a pace sufficient to usefully contribute to climate adaptation, mitigation and food security?’. Here, we address this question by critically reviewing how model‐based approaches can be used to assist breeding activities, with particular focus on all CGIAR (formerly the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research but now known simply as CGIAR) breeding programs. Crop modeling can underpin breeding efforts in many different ways, including assessing genotypic adaptability and stability, characterizing and identifying target breeding environments, identifying tradeoffs among traits for such environments, and making predictions of the likely breeding value of the genotypes. Crop modeling science within the CGIAR has contributed to all of these. However, much progress remains to be done if modeling is to effectively contribute to more targeted and impactful breeding programs under changing climates. In a period in which CGIAR breeding programs are undergoing a major modernization process, crop modelers will need to be part of crop improvement teams, with a common understanding of breeding pipelines and model capabilities and limitations, and common data standards and protocols, to ensure they follow and deliver according to clearly defined breeding products. This will, in turn, enable more rapid and better‐targeted crop modeling activities, thus directly contributing to accelerated and more impactful breeding efforts.",,English,10.1002/csc2.20048,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20800,2020,Crop Science,Crop Science Society of America (CSSA),547-567,crop modelling; plant breeding; crop improvement; climate change adaptation
Genetic diversity and population structure analysis based on the high density SNP markers in Ethiopian durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum),"Alemu, A.; Feyissa, T.; Letta, T.; Abeyo Bekele Geleta","Background: Ethiopia has been considered as a center of diversity and the second possible center of domestication of durum wheat. Genetic diversity and population structure analysis in the existing Ethiopian durum wheat germplasm have enormous importance in enhancing breeding effort and for sustainable conservation. Hence, 192 Ethiopian durum wheat accessions comprising 167 landraces collected from major wheat-growing areas of the country and 25 improved varieties released from Debre Zeit and Sinana Agricultural Research Centers, Ethiopia in different years (1994–2010) were assembled for the current study. Results: The panel was genotyped with a High-density 90 K wheat SNP array by Illumina and generated 15,338 polymorphic SNPs that were used to analyze the genetic diversity and to estimate the population structure. Varied values of genetic diversity indices were scored across chromosomes and genomes. Genome-wide mean values of Nei’s gene diversity (0.246) and polymorphism information content (0.203) were recorded signifying the presence of high genetic diversity within this collection. Minor allele frequency of the genome varied with a range of 0.005 to 0.5 scoring a mean value of 0.175. Improved varieties clustered separately to landraces in population structure analysis resulted from STRUCTURE, PCA and neighbor joining tree. Landraces clustering was irrespective of their geographical origin signifying the presence of higher admixture that could arise due to the existence of historical exchanges of seeds through informal seed system involving regional and countrywide farming communities in Ethiopia. Conclusions: Sustainable utilization and conservation of this rich Ethiopian durum wheat genetic resource is an irreplaceable means to cope up from the recurrent climate changes and biotic stresses happening widely and thereby able to keep meeting the demand of durum productivity for the ever-growing human population.",,English,10.1186/s12863-020-0825-x,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20769,2020,BMC Genetics,BioMed Central,,hard wheat; genetic diversity; population structure; single nucleotide polymorphism; land races; varieties
Grain yield genetic gains and changes in physiological related traits for CIMMYT's High Rainfall Wheat Screening Nursery tested across international environments,"Gerard, G.S.; Crespo Herrera, L.A.; Crossa, J.; Mondal, S.; Velu, G.; Juliana, P.; Huerta-Espino, J.; Vargas Hernández, M.; Randhawa, M.S.; Bhavani, S.; Braun, H.J.; Singh, R.P.","The effects of climate change together with the projected future demand represents a huge challenge for wheat production systems worldwide. Wheat breeding can contribute to global food security through the creation of genotypes exhibiting stress tolerance and higher yield potential. The objectives of our study were to (i) estimate the annual grain yield (GY) genetic gain of High Rainfall Wheat Yield Trials (HRWYT) grown from 2007 (15th HRWYT) to 2016 (24th HRWYT) across international environments, and (ii) determine the changes in physiological traits associated with GY genetic improvement. The GY genetic gains were estimated as genetic progress per se (GYP) and in terms of local checks (GYLC). In total, 239 international locations were classified into two groups: high- and low-rainfall environments based on climate variables and trial management practices. In the high-rainfall environment, the annual genetic gains for GYP and GYLC were 3.8 and 1.17 % (160 and 65.1 kg ha−1 yr−1), respectively. In the low-rainfall environment, the genetic gains were 0.93 and 0.73 % (40 and 33.1 kg ha−1 yr−1), for GYP and GYLC respectively. The GY of the lines included in each nursery showed a significant phenotypic correlation between high- and low-rainfall environments in all the examined years and several of the five best performing lines were common in both environments. The GY progress was mainly associated with increased grain weight (R2 = 0.35 p < 0.001), days to maturity (R2 = 0.20, p < 0.001) and grain filling period (R2 = 0.06, p < 0.05).

Morpho-physiological traits associated with heat stress tolerance in tropical maize (Zea mays L.) at reproductive stage,"Noor, J.J.; Vinayan, M.T.; Umar, S.; Devi, P.; Iqbal, M.; Seetharam, K.; Zaidi, P.","Heat stress resilience has emerged as an important trait in maize hybrids being targeted for post–monsoon spring cultivation in large parts of South Asia and many other parts of the tropics. Selection based on grain yield alone under heat stress is often misleading, and therefore an approach involving stress-adaptive secondary traits along with grain yield could help in the development of improved, stable heat stress tolerant cultivars. We attempted to identify reliable and effective secondary traits associated with heat stress tolerance in tropical maize and sources of heat stress tolerant germplasm. A panel of 99 elite maize inbred lines representing the wider genetic diversity of tropical maize and a set of 58 elite hybrids were phenotyped under natural heat stress and optimal temperature for grain yield and 15 secondary traits including10 morpho-physiological traits and 5 yield attributes. Evaluation under natural heat stress was done during the spring season by adjusting the planting date in so that the complete reproductive stage (from tassel emergence to late grain filling) was exposed to heat stress. The optimal temperature trial was planted during the monsoon season with no exposure to heat stress at any crop stage. Heat stress significantly affected most of the observed traits. Among the traits studied two yield attributing traits, i.e.- ears per plant (EPP) and kernel per row (KPR), and three morphological traits, i.e.- chlorophyll content (CC), leaf firing (LF) and tassel blast (TB) were found to be the key secondary traits associated with grain yield under heat stress. In addition, low anthesis-silking internal (ASI) is an important trait that needs to be added in the index selection for heat stress tolerance. The study identified nine promising heat stress tolerant maize inbred lines with desirable secondary traits and grain yield under severe heat stress, which could be used as a source of germplasm in heat stress tolerance maize breeding program.",,English,10.21475/ajcs.19.13.04.p1448,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20669,2019,Australian Journal of Crop Science,Southern Cross Publishing Group,536-545,maize; heat stress; climate change; abiotic stress
"Bridging the disciplinary gap in conservation agriculture research, in Malawi. A review","Hermans, T.D.G.; Whitfield, S.; Dougill, A.J.; Thierfelder, C.","Conservation Agriculture has emerged as a popular form of climate smart agriculture aimed at enhancing climate change resilience for smallholder farmers across Africa. Despite positive biophysical results, adoption rates remain low. It has been acknowledged that improved understanding of farmer decision-making is needed due to the variation in socio-economic and agro-ecological contexts which drives the research agenda to answer the question ‘what forms of Conservation Agriculture work, where, and why?’. To fully understand this question, we need to approach the study of Conservation Agriculture within complex farming systems by collating and integrating different forms of knowledge. In this paper, we discuss (1) a comparison of disciplinary approaches to evaluating Conservation Agriculture in Malawi, (2) the identification of the knowledge gaps that persist at the intersection of these disciplines and (3) recommendations for alternative and interdisciplinary approaches in addressing these knowledge gaps. With a focus on published studies from Malawi, we show that the Conservation Agriculture literature represents two distinct approaches to addressing the question ‘what forms of Conservation Agriculture work, where, and why?’, namely agro-ecological and socio-economic and that neither of these approaches can address the full scope of this question, in particular its ‘why’ component. To overcome these challenges, there is a need for access to compatible, comprehensive data sets, methodological approaches including farmer participation and ethnography, through on-farm trial research as a middle ground between disciplinary approaches.",,English,10.1007/s13593-020-0608-9,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20663,2020,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,Springer,,farming systems; climate-smart agriculture; zero tillage
Agricultural growth and sex-disaggregated employment in Africa: future perspectives under different investment scenarios,"Frija, A.; Chebil, A.; Mottaleb, K.A.; Mason-D'croz, D.; Dhehibi, B.","Literature is scanty on how public agricultural investments can help reducing the impact of future challenges such as climate change and population pressure on national economies. The objective of this study is to assess the medium and long-term effects of alternative agricultural research and development investment scenarios on male and female employment in 14 African countries. We first estimate the effects of agricultural investment scenarios on the overall GDP growth of a given country using partial and general equilibrium models. Secondly, using employment elasticities to GDP growth, we estimate the impact of GDP growth on overall employment in the economy. Results show that, increased investments in agriculture could generate higher overall employment and reduce gender disparities in labor participation. In 8 out of 14 sampled countries, female employment increased more than male employment in response to agricultural investments. Investment in infrastructure had higher impact on female employment growth compared to productivity scenarios.",,English,10.1016/j.gfs.2020.100353,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20661,2020,Global Food Security,Elsevier,,employment; investment; gross national product; economic growth
Effect of allele combinations at Ppd-1 loci on durum wheat grain filling at contrasting latitudes,"Arjona Rodríguez, J.M.; Royo, C.; Dreisigacker, S.; Ammar, K.; Subira, J.; Villegas, D.","Flowering time is the most critical developmental stage in wheat, as it determines environmental conditions during grain filling. Thirty-five spring durum genotypes carrying all known allele variants at Ppd-1 loci were evaluated in fully irrigated field experiments for three years at latitudes of 41°N (Spain), 27°N (northern Mexico) and 19°N (southern Mexico). Relationships between weight of central grains of main spikes (W) and thermal time from flowering to maturity were described by a logistic equation. Differences in flowering time between the allele combination causing the earliest (GS100/Ppd-B1a) and the latest (Ppd-A1b/Ppd-B1a) flowering were 7, 20 and 18 days in Spain, northern Mexico and southern Mexico, respectively. Flowering delay drastically reduced the mean grain filling rate (R) and W at all sites. At autumn-sowing sites, an increase of 1°C in mean temperature during the first half of the grain filling period decreased W by 5.2 mg per grain. At these sites, W was strongly dependent on R. At the spring-sowing site (southern Mexico), W depended on both R and grain filling duration. Our results suggest that incorporating the allele combinations GS100/Ppd-B1a and GS105/Ppd-B1a (alleles conferring photoperiod insensitivity) in newly released varieties can reduce the negative effects of climate change on grain filling at the studied latitudes.",,English,10.1111/jac.12363,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20652,2020,Journal of Agronomy and Crop Science,Wiley,64-75,flowering; seed filling; grain; photoperiodicity; solar radiation; temperature; wheat
On-farm performance and farmers’ perceptions of DroughtTEGO-climate-smart maize hybrids in Kenya,"Obunyali, C.O.; Karanja, J.; Oikeh, S.O.; Omanya, G.; Mugo, S.N.; Beyene, Y.; Oniang’o, R.","Maize (Zea mays L.) productivity in the sub-Saharan Africa is constrained by biotic and abiotic stresses that reduce yield. In the region, one of the most serious abiotic factor is frequent intermittent droughts, which has been attributed to climate change. The purpose of this paper was to use on-farm demonstration studies and farmer field days to demonstrate new drought mitigation technology and provide information on how small farmers can reduce yield losses. A total of 4814 demonstration plots of 39 DroughtTEGO maize hybrids and 19 commercial check hybrids were established in 17 counties across the low-to-mid-altitude maize-growing agroecologies of Kenya between 2015 and 2017. A total of 246 field-day workshops were conducted. Combined analyses across years and locations showed that top five DroughtTEGO hybrids increased maize yields 33 to 54% (5.5–6.3 Mg ha–1) relative to conventional hybrids. The highest yield advantage of DroughtTEGO hybrids over commercial checks was observed in the drier lower eastern region in Kenya. Farmers particularly women, preferred the DroughtTEGO hybrids because of the stay-green character, whiteness of flour (milling quality), root lodging resistance, drought-tolerance and shelling percentage. Results from this study suggested that smallholder farmers can reduce the impact of drought by seeding drought-tolerant maize hybrids.",,English,10.2134/agronj2019.08.0600,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20647,2019,Agronomy Journal,American Society of Agronomy,2754-2768,maize; drought tolerance; hybrids; on-farm research
A white paper on global wheat health based on scenario development and analysis,"Savary, S.; Djurle, A.; Yuen, J.E.; Ficke, A.; Rossi, V.; Esker, P.D.; Fernandes, J.M.C.; Ponte, E.M.; Kumar, J.; Madden, L.V.; Paul, P.; McRoberts, N.; Singh, P.K.; Huber, L.; Pope de Vallavielle, C.; Saint-Jean, S.; Willocquet, L.","Scenario analysis constitutes a useful approach to synthesize knowledge and derive hypotheses in the case of complex systems that are documented with mainly qualitative or very diverse information. In this article, a framework for scenario analysis is designed and then, applied to global wheat health within a timeframe from today to 2050. Scenario analysis entails the choice of settings, the definition of scenarios of change, and the analysis of outcomes of these scenarios in the chosen settings. Three idealized agrosystems, representing a large fraction of the global diversity of wheat-based agrosystems, are considered, which represent the settings of the analysis. Several components of global changes are considered in their consequences on global wheat health: climate change and climate variability, nitrogen fertilizer use, tillage, crop rotation, pesticide use, and the deployment of host plant resistances. Each idealized agrosystem is associated with a scenario of change that considers first, a production situation and its dynamics, and second, the impacts of the evolving production situation on the evolution of crop health. Crop health is represented by six functional groups of wheat pathogens: the pathogens associated with Fusarium head blight; biotrophic fungi, Septoria-like fungi, necrotrophic fungi, soilborne pathogens, and insect-transmitted viruses. The analysis of scenario outcomes is conducted along a risk-analytical pattern, which involves risk probabilities represented by categorized probability levels of disease epidemics, and risk magnitudes represented by categorized levels of crop losses resulting from these levels of epidemics within each production situation. The results from this scenario analysis suggest an overall increase of risk probabilities and magnitudes in the three idealized agrosystems. Changes in risk probability or magnitude however vary with the agrosystem and the functional groups of pathogens. We discuss the effects of global changes on the six functional groups, in terms of their epidemiology and of the crop losses they cause. Scenario analysis enables qualitative analysis of complex systems, such as plant pathosystems that are evolving in response to global changes, including climate change and technology shifts. It also provides a useful framework for quantitative simulation modeling analysis for plant disease epidemiology.",,English,10.1094/PHYTO-01-17-0027-FI,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20629,2017,Phytopathology,American Phytopathological Society (APS),1109-1122,systems analysis; wheat; plant protection; crop forecasting; climate change; risk analysis
Variation in occurrence and aflatoxigenicity of Aspergillus flavus from two climatically varied regions in Kenya,"Monda, E.; Masanga, J.; Alakonya, A.","Aflatoxins are carcinogenic chemical metabolites produced by Aspergillus spp. of the section Flavi. In Kenya, Aspergillus flavus is the most prevalent and has been associated with several acute and chronic aflatoxin outbreaks in the past. In this study, we evaluated the occurrence of A. flavus in soils from two agro-ecological regions with contrasting climatic conditions, aflatoxin contamination histories and cropping systems. Aspergillus spp. were first isolated from soils before the identification and determination of their aflatoxigenicity. Further, we determined the occurrence of Pseudomonas and Bacillus spp. in soils from the two regions. These bacterial species have long been associated with biological control of several plant pathogens including Aspergillus spp. Our results show that A. flavus occurred widely and produced comparatively higher total aflatoxin levels in all (100%) study sites from the eastern to the western regions of Kenya. For the western region, A. flavus was detected in 4 locations (66.7%) that were previously under maize cultivation with the isolates showing low aflatoxigenicity. A. flavus was not isolated from soils under sugarcane cultivation. Distribution of the two bacterial species varied across the regions but we detected a weak relationship between occurrence of bacterial species and A. flavus. We discuss these findings in the context of the influence of climate, microbial profiles, cropping systems and applicability in the deployment of biological control remedies against aflatoxin contamination.",,English,10.3390/toxins12010034,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20618,2020,Toxins,MDPI,,aflatoxins; agroecology; aspergillus flavus; biological control; climate change; cropping systems; microorganisms
Cost-effective opportunities for climate change mitigation in Indian agriculture,"Sapkota, T.; Vetter, S.H.; Jat, M.L.; Smita P.S. Sirohi; Shirsath, P.B.; Singh, R.; Jat, H.S.; Smith, P.; Hillier, J.; Stirling, C.","Long-term changes in average temperatures, precipitation, and climate variability threaten agricultural production, food security, and the livelihoods of farming communities globally. Whilst adaptation to climate change is necessary to ensure food security and protect livelihoods of poor farmers, mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can lessen the extent of climate change and future needs for adaptation. Many agricultural practices can potentially mitigate GHG emissions without compromising food production. India is the third largest GHG emitter in the world where agriculture is responsible for 18% of total national emissions. India has identified agriculture as one of the priority sectors for GHG emission reduction in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Identification of emission hotspots and cost-effective mitigation options in agriculture can inform the prioritisation of efforts to reduce emissions without compromising food and nutrition security. We adopted a bottom-up approach to analyse GHG emissions using large datasets of India's ‘cost of cultivation survey’ and the ‘19th livestock census’ together with soil, climate and management data for each location. Mitigation measures and associated costs and benefits of adoption, derived from a variety of sources including the literature, stakeholder meetings and expert opinion, were presented in the form of Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC). We estimated that by 2030, business-as-usual GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in India would be 515 Megatonne CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) per year with a technical mitigation potential of 85.5 MtCO2e per year through adoption of various mitigation practices. About 80% of the technical mitigation potential could be achieved by adopting only cost-saving measures. Three mitigation options, i.e. efficient use of fertilizer, zero-tillage and rice-water management, could deliver more than 50% of the total technical abatement potential.",,English,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.225,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20590,2019,Science of the Total Environment,Elsevier,1342-1354,agricultural practices; emission reduction; greenhouse gas emissions; climate change
Climate change mitigation options among farmers in South Asia,"Aryal, J.P.; Rahut, D.B.; Sapkota, T.; Khurana, R.; Khatri-Chhetri, A.","Agriculture in South Asia is highly vulnerable to climate change due to increasing variability in rainfall and rising temperatures leading to the incidence of extreme climatic events such as foods, droughts, heat/cold waves, and storms.

Hence, adaptation-led mitigation measures are required to sustain agricultural productivity, farm income and reduce GHG emissions wherever possible. This study presents a systematic review of agriculture emission reduction opportunities with a particular focus on agricultural production systems in South Asia. Our review indicates that the adoption of better soil, water, nutrient management practices, and technologies has enormous potential to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture, thereby contributing to the mitigation of climate change. Many existing practices and technologies have the potential to improve both adaptation and mitigation in agriculture which can signifcantly contribute to complying with nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of South Asian countries.

Therefore, adaptation measures are required to sustain agricultural productivity, to reduce vulnerability, and to enhance the resilience of the agricultural system to climate change. There are many adaptation practices in the production systems that have been proposed and tested for minimizing the efects of climate change. Some socioeconomic and political setup contributes to adaptation, while others may inhibit it. This paper presents a systematic review of the impacts of climate change on crop production and also the major options in the agricultural sector that are available for adaptation to climate change. One of the key conclusions is that agricultural practices that help climate change adaptation in agriculture are available, while the institutional setup to implement and disseminate those technical solutions is yet to be strengthened. Thus, it is important to examine how to bring the required institutional change, generate fund to invest on these changes, and design dynamic policies for long-term climate change adaptation in agriculture rather than a mere focus on agricultural technology.

Development of a participatory approach for mapping climate risks and adaptive interventions (CS-MAP) in Vietnam’s Mekong River Delta,"Bui Tan Yen; Nguyen Hong Son; Le Thanh Tung; Amjath-Babu, T.S; Sebastian, L.","The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in 2016 adversely affected Vietnam particularly in the Mekong River Delta (MRD), where more than 90% of the country’s rice export is produced annually. During that time, salinity intrusion and drought significantly affected agricultural production in the area. Furthermore, flooding is another recurring event in the area that is increasing in frequency. An assessment conducted by CGIAR Centers showed that even as warnings were provided by the government for the 2016 ENSO, these were not translated into appropriate preparations and responsive actions for agriculture. To address this critical issue, the Department of Crop Production (DCP) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural  Development (MARD) of Vietnam, and CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security in Southeast Asia (CCAFS-SEA) collaborated to develop and test an participatory approach for mapping climate risks and adaptive interventions (CS-MAP) to recognize climate-related risks, identify potentially affected areas and develop regional and provincial adaptation plans for rice production. The CS-MAP is a participatory approach involving experts from various local and national offices for: (1) identifying climate-related risks; (2) delineating affected areas and risk levels; (3) proposing corresponding adaptive plans; (4) fine tuning and verifying proposed measures; and (5) developing integrated provincial and regional adaptation plans. Risks and adaptive interventions maps were developed for normal and ENSO years by using technical data (i.e. topography and hydrology), infrastructures (i.e. dikes, road and canals), and local observations.

Can Bangladesh produce enough cereals to meet future demand?,"Timsina, J.; Wolf, J.; Guilpart, N.; Bussel, L.G.J. Van; Grassini, P.; Wart, J. van; Hossain, A.; Rashid, H.; Saiful Islam; Ittersum, M.K. van","Bangladesh faces huge challenges in achieving food security due to its high population, diet changes, and limited room for expanding cropland and cropping intensity. The objective of this study is to assess the degree to which Bangladesh can be self-sufficient in terms of domestic maize, rice and wheat production by the years 2030 and 2050 by closing the existing gap (Yg) between yield potential (Yp) and actual farm yield (Ya), accounting for possible changes in cropland area. Yield potential and yield gaps were calculated for the three crops using well-validated crop models and site-specific weather, management and soil data, and upscaled to the whole country. We assessed potential grain production in the years 2030 and 2050 for six land use change scenarios (general decrease in arable land; declining ground water tables in the north; cropping of fallow areas in the south; effect of sea level rise; increased cropping intensity; and larger share of cash crops) and three levels of Yg closure (1: no yield increase; 2: Yg closure at a level equivalent to 50% (50% Yg closure); 3: Yg closure to a level of 85% of Yp (irrigated crops) and 80% of water-limited yield potential or Yw (rainfed crops) (full Yg closure)). In addition, changes in demand with low and high population growth rates, and substitution of rice by maize in future diets were also examined. Total aggregated demand of the three cereals (in milled rice equivalents) in 2030 and 2050, based on the UN median population variant, is projected to be 21 and 24% higher than in 2010. Current Yg represent 50% (irrigated rice), 48–63% (rainfed rice), 49% (irrigated wheat), 40% (rainfed wheat), 46% (irrigated maize), and 44% (rainfed maize) of their Yp or Yw. With 50% Yg closure and for various land use changes, self-sufficiency ratio will be N1 for rice in 2030 and about one in 2050 but well below one for maize and wheat in both 2030 and 2050. With full Yg closure, self-sufficiency ratios will be well above one for rice and all three cereals jointly but below one for maize and wheat for all scenarios, except for the scenario with drastic decrease in boro rice area to allow for area expansion for cash crops. Full Yg closure of all cereals is needed to compensate for area decreases and demand increases, and then even some maize and large amounts of wheat imports will be required to satisfy demand in future. The results of this analysis have important implications for Bangladesh and other countries with high population growth rate, shrinking arable land due to rapid urbanization, and highly vulnerable to climate change.",,English,10.1016/j.agsy.2016.11.003,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20556,2018,Agricultural Systems,Elsevier,36-44,food security; yield potential; yield gap; self-sufficiency; farmland
Smallholders’ coping mechanisms with wheat rust epidemics: lessons from Ethiopia,"Jaleta, M.; Hodson, D.P.; Abeyo Bekele Geleta; Yirga, C.; Erenstein, O.","Crops are variously susceptible to biotic stresses–something expected to increase under climate change. In the case of staple crops, this potentially undermines household and national food security. We examine recent wheat rust epidemics and smallholders’ coping mechanisms in Ethiopia as a case study. Wheat is a major food crop in Ethiopia widely grown by smallholders. In 2010/11 a yellow rust epidemic affected over one-third of the national wheat area. Two waves of nationally representative household level panel data collected for the preceding wheat season (2009/10) and three years after (2013/14) the occurrence of the epidemic allow us to analyze the different coping mechanisms farmers used in response. Apart from using fungicides as ex-post coping mechanism, increasing wheat area under yellow rust resistant varieties, increasing diversity of wheat varieties grown, or a combination of these strategies were the main ex-ante coping mechanisms farmers had taken in reducing the potential effects of rust re-occurrence. Large-scale dis-adoption of highly susceptible varieties and replacement with new, rust resistant varieties was observed subsequent to the 2010/11 epidemic. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify the key factors associated with smallholder ex-ante coping strategies. Household characteristics, level of specialization in wheat and access to improved wheat seed were the major factors that explained observed choices. There was 29–41% yield advantage in increasing wheat area to the new, resistant varieties even under normal seasons with minimum rust occurrence in the field. Continuous varietal development in responding to emerging new rust races and supporting the deployment of newly released resistant varieties could help smallholders in dealing with rust challenges and maintaining improved yields in the rustprone environments of Ethiopia. Given the global importance of both wheat and yellow rust and climate change dynamics study findings have relevance to other regions.",,English,10.1371/journal.pone.0219327,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20540,2019,PLoS ONE,Public Library of Science,art. e0219327,smallholders; rusts; wheat

Though agriculture-related emissions are prominent in emission profiles of South Asian countries, their emission reduction commitments are less likely to include agriculture, partly because of a concern over food security. We find that income-enhancing mitigation technologies that do not jeopardize food security may significantly augment the region’s mitigation potential. In the case of adaptation, analysis shows that the greatest effort will be directed towards protecting the cornerstones of the ‘green revolution’ for ensuring food security. Development of efficient and climate-resilient agricultural value chains and integrated farming bodies will be important to ensuring adaptation investment. Potentially useful models of landscape level climate resilience actions and ecosystem-based adaptation are also presented, along with estimates of the aggregate costs of agricultural adaptation. Countries in the region propose different mixes of domestic and foreign, and public and private, adaptation finance to meet the substantial gaps.",,English,10.1080/14693062.2018.1501329,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20521,2019,Climate Policy,Taylor & Francis,283-298,climate change mitigation; environmental policies; agriculture
Future changes and uncertainty in decision-relevant measures of East African climate,"Bornemann, F.J.; Rowell, P.; Evans, B.; Lapworth, D.J.; Lwiza, K.; Macdonald, D.M.J.; Marsham, J.H.; Tesfaye, K.; Ascott, M.J.; Way, C.","The need for the development of adaptation strategies for climate change in Africa is becoming critical. For example, infrastructure with a long lifespan now needs to be designed or adapted to account for a future climate that will be different from the past or present. There is a growing necessity for the climate information used in decision making to change from traditional science-driven metrics to decision-driven metrics. This is particularly relevant in East Africa, where limited adaptation and socio-economic capacity make this region acutely vulnerable to climate change. Here, we employ an interdisciplinary consultation process to define and analyse a number of such decision-oriented metrics. These metrics take a holistic approach, addressing the key East African sectors of agriculture, water supply, fisheries, flood management, urban infrastructure and urban health. A multifaceted analysis of multimodel climate projections then provides a repository of user-focused information on climate change and its uncertainties, for all metrics and seasons and two future time horizons. The spatial character and large intermodel uncertainty of changes in temperature and rainfall metrics are described, as well as those of other relevant metrics such as evaporation and solar radiation. Intermodel relationships amongst metrics are also explored, with two clear clusters forming around rainfall and temperature metrics. This latter analysis determines the extent to which model weights could, or could not, be applied across multiple climate metrics. Further work must now focus on maximising the utility of model projections, and developing tailored risk-based communication strategies.",,English,10.1007/s10584-019-02499-2,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20501,2019,Climatic Change,Springer,365-384,climate change adaptation; decision making
How much does climate change add to the challenge of feeding the planet this century?,"Aggarwal, P.K.; Vyas, S.; Thornton, P.; Campbell, B.M.","The impacts of climate change on crop yields, as projected by a slew of impact assessments carried out since the 1980s, have brought the issue of future food insecurity to the fore. A meta-analysis of ∼27 000 data points from studies published over the last four decades reveals that at country level, average impacts of climate change on crop yields up to the 2050s are generally small (but negative) for rice and wheat, and modest for maize, provided farmers adopt practices and technologies such as improved varieties, planting at optimal times, and improved water and fertilizer management. These technologies also have the potential to reduce differences across political, economic and climatic regions. Once these are adopted, climate change may not add significantly to the challenge of food production for the majority of countries except for some potential hotspots distributed around the world. Massive investment, policy, and institutional support will be needed, however, to facilitate adoption and scaling-out of such practices, and to address climatic variability.",,English,10.1088/1748-9326/aafa3e,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20259,2019,Environmental Research Letters,IOP Publishing,,climate change; food security; climate change adaptation; agriculture; climate change impact; meta-analysis
"The abandonment of maize landraces over the last 50 years in Morelos, Mexico: a tracing study using a multi-level perspective","McLean R., F.D.; Camacho Villa, T.C.; Almekinders, C.; Pè, M.E.; Dell'acqua, M.; Costich, D.E.","Understanding the causes of maize landrace loss in farmers’ field is essential to design effective conservation strategies. These strategies are necessary to ensure that genetic resources are available in the future. Previous studies have shown that this loss is caused by multiple factors. In this longitudinal study, we used a collection of 93 maize landrace accessions from Morelos, Mexico, and stored at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) Maize Germplasm Bank, to trace back to the original 66 donor families after 50 years and explore the causes for why they abandoned or conserved their seed lots. We used an actor-centered approach, based on interviews and focus group discussions. We adopt a Multi-Level Perspective framework to examine loss as a process, accommodating multiple causes and the interactions among them. We found that the importance of maize landrace cultivation had diminished over the last 50 years in the study area. By 2017, 13 families had conserved a total of 14 seed lots directly descended from the 1967 collection. Focus group participants identified 60 accessions that could still be found in the surrounding municipalities. Our findings showed that multiple interconnected changes in maize cultivation technologies, as well as in maize markets, other crop markets, agricultural and land policies, cultural preferences, urbanization and climate change, have created an unfavorable environment for the conservation of maize landraces. Many of these processes were location- and landrace-specific, and often led to landrace abandonment during the shift from one farmer generation to the next.",,English,10.1007/s10460-019-09932-3,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20247,2019,Agriculture and Human Values,Springer,651-668,genetic resources conservation; genetic resources; genetic erosion; plant genetics; zea mays; land races; plant genetic resources; in situ; ex situ
Accountability mechanisms in international climate change financing,"Basak, R.; Van Der Werf, E.","This paper uses agency theory to analyse the incentives that a donor (principal) and recipient (agent) face as actors in an accountability regime for the financing of international climate change projects in developing countries. We address the following question: What accountability measures serve to align the incentives of the donor with those of the recipient in climate change financing? We focus on the relationship between the Green Climate Fund as a donor and one of its Accredited Entities as a recipient. We examine the consequences of misaligned incentives and asymmetric information, looking at a specific set of accountability measures, including performance indicators, penalties for poor performance, as well as the role of pressure exerted by civil society organisations (CSOs). We find that the use of imperfect performance indicators can reduce the risk of project failure if they are strongly correlated with adaptation and mitigation impacts. Penalties can have a positive impact on project outcomes, but impose risks upon the agent, which could lead him to refuse the contract for the implementation of the climate change project. The pressure of CSOs was found to have the potential to motivate donors and recipients to become more efficient and effective in their delivery of projects but could also lead to the donor choosing to finance lower-risk projects with fewer climate change benefits. We suggest that accountability requirements need to be carefully balanced with other objectives, including having a diverse set of entities willing to bid for the delivery of projects.",,English,10.1007/s10784-019-09437-8,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20233,2019,"International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",Springer,297-313,accounting; climate change; indicators; civil society organizations; fund; principal-agent problem; information asymmetry; climate finance; performance indicators; green climate fund

While technology to accurately measure soil C concentrations and stocks has been in use for decades, many challenges to routine, cost-effective soil C quantification remain, including large spatial variability, low signal-to-noise and often high cost and standardization issues for direct measurement with destructive sampling. Models, empirical and process-based, may provide a cost-effective and practical means for soil C quantification to support C sequestration policies. Examples are described of how soil science and soil C quantification methods are being used to support domestic climate change policies to promote soil C sequestration on agricultural lands (cropland and grazing land) at national and provincial levels in Australia and Canada.

"Collaborative research on Conservation Agriculture in Bajío, Mexico: continuities and discontinuities of partnerships","Martinez Cruz, T.E.; Almekinders, C.; Camacho Villa, T.C.","Agricultural technologies are debated and contested. Studying the socio-political life of agricultural research can help us to understand why some particular technologies or pathways are favoured (and others not) and eventually why expectations are maintained or not. We studied the 30-year trajectory of practices of Conservation Agriculture in the central region of Mexico. The results of our interviews and literature review show how, over the course of time, Conservation Agriculture (CA) technology has successively changed from being referred to as Conservation Tillage, Direct Seeding, Conservation Agriculture and has now, finally become integrated within Sustainable Intensification. These changes are connected with revamped narratives and the applications of the latest research and development (R&D) paradigms. They were the result of new spaces for CA projects opening up after other spaces had closed, spaces that allowed the researchers, politicians, technicians and farmers to continue to engage in CA in a reconfigured way that fit the various agendas. The opening and closure of spaces for CA projects were the result of researchers being subject to, and taking advantage of, political changes and of politicians seeking new initiatives to support their agendas. This shows how research and politics are mutually dependent and how they generate a discontinuity of project interventions which, paradoxically, represent a continuity of agendas and research processes. As CA is both a complex and flexible technology, it has been possible to make it fit to accommodate the changing agendas of different actors.",,English,10.1080/14735903.2019.1625593,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20213,2019,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,Taylor & Francis,243-256,conservation agriculture; agricultural research; policies; food security; climate change; agricultural technology; boundary object
Productivity and production risk effects of adopting drought-tolerant maize varieties in Zambia,"Amondo, E.; Simtowe, F.P.; Rahut, D.B.; Erenstein, O.","Productivity and production risks affect the use of agricultural production practices and inputs, particularly in developing countries. This paper aims to investigate the effects of adopting drought-tolerant maize varieties (DTMVs) on farm productivity, yield variance and downside risk exposure of maize growing households of Zambia. The study uses household survey data collected from 11 maize producing districts of Eastern, Southern and Copperbelt provinces of Zambia using a structured questionnaire. The Antle’s flexible moment-based approach was used in specifying, estimating and testing a stochastic production function. The study further applied an endogenous switching regression model to control for both observable and unobservable sources of bias. The study revealed that DTMV adoption increases maize yield by 15 per cent and reduces the risk of crop failure: reducing yield variance by 38 per cent and exposure to downside risk by 36 per cent. This study establishes the benefits of DTMV adoption in Zambia with regards to productivity, yield stability and downside risk in the face of climate change. Results from this study underscore the need for more concerted efforts to scale-out DTMVs for both maize productivity enhancement and for risk mitigation against weather shocks.",,English,10.1108/IJCCSM-03-2018-0024,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20182,2019,International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management,Emerald Publishing Limited,570-591,risk; productivity; regression analysis; drought tolerance; maize; varieties; crop improvement; endogenous switching regression; improved maize varieties
Heterogeneous seed access and information exposure:  implications for the adoption of drought-tolerant maize varieties in Uganda,"Simtowe, F.P.; Marenya, P.P.; Amondo, E.; Regasa, M.W.; Rahut, D.B.; Erenstein, O.","Frequent droughts in sub-Saharan Africa imply water stress for rainfed agriculture and, ultimately, food insecurity, underlining the region’s vulnerability to climate change. Yet, in the maize-growing areas, farmers have been given new drought coping options following the release and availability of drought-tolerant maize varieties (DTMVs). These varieties are being disseminated through the National Agricultural Research and Extension Systems in collaboration with seed companies; however, their adoption still appears somewhat modest, and empirical studies on their adoption potential and associated drivers are scarce. We use empirical data from Uganda to estimate the actual and potential adoption rates and the adoption determinants of DTMVs under information and seed access constraints. Adoption rates for DTMVs could have been up to 22% in 2015 instead of the observed sample adoption rate of 14% if the whole population had been exposed to them. The adoption rate could increase to 30% if seed were availed to the farming population and to 47% if seed were sold at a more affordable price to farmers. The observed adoption rate of 14% implies gaps in the potential adoption rates of 8%, 16%, and 33% because of a lack of awareness, a lack of seed access, and high seed prices, respectively. The findings underscore the role of both market and non-market-based approaches and the potential to further scale the cultivation of DTMVs in Uganda.",,English,10.1186/s40100-019-0135-7,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20181,2019,Agricultural and Food Economics,Springer,,drought tolerance; varieties; maize; seed
Importance of considering technology growth in impact assessments of climate change on agriculture,"Aggarwal, P.K.; Vyas, S.; Thornton, P.; Campbell, B.M.; Kropff, Martinus","Many assessments of climate change impacts on global crop yields project declines as early as the 2020s. Losses are projected to increase with time, up to 50% by the 2080s. We carry out a systematic global review and compare published projections of climate change impacts from 34 studies and ∼4500 data points for the 2020s for maize, rice and wheat at country level with observed and forecasted national crop yields for the same period based on available global crop statistics. We find that observed yield changes are considerably higher than projected yield changes arising from climate change because technological improvements appear to have a large yield-enhancing impact compared with the negative effects of climate change, at least in the short term. Most assessments of climate change impacts on crop yields show low-latitude, low and middle-income countries as highly vulnerable but these countries have shown the largest growth in observed yields over the same reference time period. These discrepancies are due to incomplete consideration of technological growth in climate impact assessments and large yield gaps in these countries, uncertainties associated with the methodologies used, and regional variations in adaptation options considered. Appropriate consideration of technological growth can add considerable value and relevance to global impact assessments, contributing to investment and development targeting at both large and small scales.",,English,10.1016/j.gfs.2019.04.002,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20158,2019,Global Food Security,Elsevier,41-48,climate change; impact assessment; technology; agriculture; food security; crop yield; impacts
Stakeholders prioritization of climate-smart agriculture interventions:  evaluation of a framework,"Khatri-Chhetri, A.; Pant, A.; Aggarwal, P.K.; Vasireddy, V.V.; Yadav, A.K.","This paper presents a framework to prioritize locally suitable climate-smart agricultural (CSA) interventions and implementation suitability assessments with key stakeholders: state and district agriculture departments, extension offices, agriculture research institutions, NGOs and donor agencies, private sector and farmers. Prioritization of appropriate interventions for given contexts is needed to assist relevant stakeholders to make strategic decisions and improve adaptability and efficiency of agriculture production system in the face of climate change and variability. First step includes participatory identification and evaluation of location specific CSA interventions suitable for different crop and cropping system with potential to reduce climatic risks in agriculture. All CSA interventions were evaluated based on their contribution to increase farm productivity and income, building resilience to changing climate and reduction of agricultural emissions. Second step includes evaluation of overall implementation feasibility of selected CSA interventions based on their technical feasibility, cost of implementation, inclusivity and synergy with current government programs. In the third step, potential barriers of CSA technology adoption were assessed linking with availability of resources, farmers' knowledge and acceptability, access to agriculture extensions service, market and government support. In the fourth step, incentive mechanisms to promote CSA interventions such as government subsidy, market linkage, provision of loan and capacity building were evaluated with farmers and key stakeholders. Finally, this prioritization framework assessed the role of different organizations such as the government, private sector, non-government organizations, custom hiring centers and community based organizations in promoting CSA interventions at the local level. Results show that this framework provides ample space for local stakeholders to integrate their knowledge and experience on CSA interventions in prioritization and investment planning. Stakeholders prioritized mainly water and nutrient management technologies, agriculture insurance against climatic risks and ICT based weather and agro-advisory services. This framework provides a decision support tool for policymaking in adaptation and mitigation activities in agriculture sector at the local level.

Potential of climate-smart agriculture in reducing women farmers’ drudgery in high climatic risk areas,"Khatri-Chhetri, A.; Punya Prasad Regmi; Chanana, N.; Aggarwal, P.K.","Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has a significant role to play in reducing the gender gap in labor burden for women in agriculture. A targeted approach to address this gap can be useful in developing a women-responsive climatic risk management plan focused on reducing their labor burden in agriculture, especially in areas with high climate risks. The paper therefore presents a top–down approach to identify potential labor-saving CSA technologies for women farmers in areas facing high climate risks. It involves mapping women in agriculture, climate risks, and poverty hotspots and entails understanding the role of women in agricultural activities to identify the suitable CSA options for reducing the levels of labor drudgery. The study is illustrated for Nepal where feminization of agriculture is rapidly increasing, a high level of climatic risks persists, and adaptive capacity to climate change is very low, especially among women in agriculture. Results are presented for two hotspot districts, Rupandehi and Chitwan. Household socioeconomic characteristics were found to play a major role in women’s labor contribution in different crop production activities. Discussions with farmers provided a list of more than 15 CSA interventions with labor reduction as well as yield-improving potential. Accordingly, considering the local crop, agro-climate, and social conditions, and women’s participation in different agricultural activities, CSA technologies and practices such as direct seeded rice (zero tillage and low tillage using machine), green manuring (GM), laser land leveling (LLL), and system of rice intensification (SRI) were found to potentially reduce women’s drudgery in agriculture along with improvement in productivity and farm income.",,English,10.1007/s10584-018-2350-8,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/20067,2020,Climatic Change,Springer,29-42,agriculture; women farmers; climate-smart agriculture; agricultural practices; labour saving technologies for women
Challenges and responses to ongoing and projected climate change for dryland cereal production systems throughout the world,"O'Leary, G.J.; Aggarwal, P.K.; Calderini, D.; Connor, D.; Craufurd, P.; Eigenbrode, S.D.; Xue Han; Hatfield, J.L.","Since the introduction of mechanized production in both developed and developing countries, crops and their management have undergone significant adaptation resulting in increased productivity. Historical yield increases in wheat have occurred across most regions of the world (20–88 kg ha−1 year−1 ), but climate trends threaten to dampen or reverse these gains such that yields are expected to decrease by 5–6% despite rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Current and projected climatic factors are temporally and spatially variable in dryland cereal production systems throughout the world. Productivity gains in wheat in some locations have been achieved from traditional agronomic practices and breeding. Continued improvement in all cereal production regions and locations of the world requires technical advances, including closer monitoring of soils, water conservation strategies, and multiple sowing times using different crops to reduce risks. The management of disease, pests, and weeds will be an added challenge, especially in areas of higher precipitation. Excellent progress has been achieved in Asia and there is much potential in Sub-Saharan Africa.

An informational view of accession rarity and allele specificity in germplasm banks for management and conservation,"Reyes-Valdés, M.H.; Burgueño, J.; Singh, S.; Martinez, O.; Sansaloni, C.","Germplasm banks are growing in their importance, number of accessions and amount of characterization data, with a large emphasis on molecular genetic markers. In this work, we offer an integrated view of accessions and marker data in an information theory framework. The basis of this development is the mutual information between accessions and allele frequencies for molecular marker loci, which can be decomposed in allele specificities, as well as in rarity and divergence of accessions. In this way, formulas are provided to calculate the specificity of the different marker alleles with reference to their distribution across accessions, accession rarity, defined as the weighted average of the specificity of its alleles, and divergence, defined by the Kullback-Leibler formula. Albeit being different measures, it is demonstrated that average rarity and divergence are equal for any collection. These parameters can contribute to the knowledge of the structure of a germplasm collection and to make decisions about the preservation of rare variants. The concepts herein developed served as the basis for a strategy for core subset selection called HCore, implemented in a publicly available R script. As a proof of concept, the mathematical view and tools developed in this research were applied to a large collection of Mexican wheat accessions, widely characterized by SNP markers. The most specific alleles were found to be private of a single accession, and the distribution of this parameter had its highest frequencies at low levels of specificity. Accession rarity and divergence had largely symmetrical distributions, and had a positive, albeit non-strictly linear relationship. Comparison of the HCore approach for core subset selection, with three state-of-the-art methods, showed it to be superior for average divergence and rarity, mean genetic distance and diversity. The proposed approach can be used for knowledge extraction and decision making in germplasm collections of diploid, inbred or outbred species.",,English,10.1371/journal.pone.0193346,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19951,2018,PLoS ONE,Public Library of Science,,wheat; climate change; alleles; germplasm banks; plant breeding; plant genetics; germplasm conservation
Integrating genomic-enabled prediction and high-throughput phenotyping in breeding for climate-resilient bread wheat,"Juliana, P.; Montesinos-Lopez, O.A.; Crossa, J.; Mondal, S.; González Pérez, L.; Poland, J.; Huerta-Espino, J.; Crespo Herrera, L.A.; Velu, G.; Dreisigacker, S.; Shrestha, S.; Pérez-Rodríguez, P.; Pinto Espinosa, F.; Singh, R.P.","Genomic selection and high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) are promising tools to accelerate breeding gains for high-yielding and climate-resilient wheat varieties. Hence, our objective was to evaluate them for predicting grain yield (GY) in drought-stressed (DS) and late-sown heat-stressed (HS) environments of the International maize and wheat improvement center?s elite yield trial nurseries. We observed that the average genomic prediction accuracies using fivefold cross-validations were 0.50 and 0.51 in the DS and HS environments, respectively. However, when a different nursery/year was used to predict another nursery/year, the average genomic prediction accuracies in the DS and HS environments decreased to 0.18 and 0.23, respectively. While genomic predictions clearly outperformed pedigree-based predictions across nurseries, they were similar to pedigree-based predictions within nurseries due to small family sizes. In populations with some full-sibs in the training population, the genomic and pedigree-based prediction accuracies were on average 0.27 and 0.35 higher than the accuracies in populations with only one progeny per cross, indicating the importance of genetic relatedness between the training and validation populations for good predictions. We also evaluated the item-based collaborative filtering approach for multivariate prediction of GY using the green normalized difference vegetation index from HTP. This approach proved to be the best strategy for across-nursery predictions, with average accuracies of 0.56 and 0.62 in the DS and HS environments, respectively.

Genetic gains for grain yield in CIMMYT’s semi-arid wheat yield trials grown in suboptimal environments,"Crespo Herrera, L.A.; Crossa, J.; Huerta-Espino, J.; Vargas Hernández, M.; Mondal, S.; Velu, G.; Payne, T.S.; Braun, H.J.; Singh, R.P.","Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major staple food crop grown worldwide on >220 million ha. Climate change is regarded to have severe effect on wheat yields, and unpredictable drought stress is one of the most important factors.

The objective of our study was to determine the annual genetic gain for grain yield (GY) of the internationally distributed Semi-Arid Wheat Yield Trials, grown during 2002–2003 to 2013–2014 and developed by the Bread Wheat Breeding program at the CIMMYT. We analyzed data from 740 locations across 66 countries, which were classified in low-yielding (LYE) and medium-yielding (MYE) environments according to a cluster analysis. The rate of GY increase (GYC) was estimated relative to four drought-tolerant wheat lines used as constant checks. Our results estimate that the rate of GYC in LYE was 1.8% (38.13 kg ha−1 yr−1), whereas in MYE, it was 1.41% (57.71 kg ha−1 yr−1). The increase in GYC across environments was 1.6% (48.06 kg ha−1 yr−1).

"Managing vulnerability to drought and enhancing livelihood resilience in sub-Saharan Africa: Technological, institutional and policy options","Shiferaw, B.; Tesfaye, K.; Kassie, M.; Abate, T.; Prasanna, B.M.; Menkir, A.","Agriculture and the economies of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are highly sensitive to climatic variability. Drought, in particular, represents one of the most important natural factors contributing to malnutrition and famine in many parts of the region. The overall impact of drought on a given country/region and its ability to recover from the resulting social, economic and environmental impacts depends on several factors. The economic, social and environmental impacts of drought are huge in SSA and the national costs and losses incurred threaten to undermine the wider economic and development gains made in the last few decades in the region. There is an urgent need to reduce the vulnerability of countries to climate variability and to the threats posed by climate change. This paper attempts to highlight the challenges of drought in SSA and reviews the current drought risk management strategies, especially the promising technological and policy options for managing drought risks to protect livelihoods and reduce vulnerability. The review suggests the possibilities of several ex ante and ex post drought management strategies in SSA although their effectiveness depends on agro-climatic and socio-economic conditions. Existing technological, policy and institutional risk management measures need to be strengthened and integrated to manage drought ex ante and to minimize the ex post negative effects for vulnerable households and regions. A proactive approach that combines promising technological, institutional and policy solutions to manage the risks within vulnerable communities implemented by institutions operating at different levels (community, sub-national, and national) is considered to be the way forward for managing drought and climate variability.",,English,10.1016/j.wace.2014.04.004,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19768,2014,Weather and Climate Extremes,Elsevier,67-79,climate change; drought; weather hazards; risk management; technology; policies; climate variability; drought risk management; technology and policy options
On-farm economic and environmental impact of zero-tillage wheat: a case of North-West India,"Aryal, J.P.; Sapkota, T.; Jat, M.L.; Bishnoi, D.K.","Conducting farmers participatory field trials at 40 sites for 3 consecutive years in four rice-wheat system dominated districts of Haryana state of India, this paper tested the hypothesis that zero tillage (ZT) based crop production emits less greenhouse gases and yet provide adequate economic benefits to farmers compared to the conventional tillage (CT). In each farmer's field, ZT and CT based wheat production were compared side by side for three consecutive years from 2009–10 to 2011–12. In assessing the mitigation potential of ZT, we examined the differences in input use and crop management, especially those contributing to GHGs emissions, between ZT wheat and CT wheat. We employed Cool Farm Tool (CFT) to estimate emission of GHGs from various wheat production activities. In order to assess economic benefits, we examined the difference in input costs, net returns and cost-benefit analysis of wheat production under CT and ZT. Results show that farmers can save approximately USD 79 ha−1 in terms of total production costs and increase net revenue of about USD 97.5 ha−1 under ZT compared to CT. Similarly, benefit-cost ratio under ZT is 1.43 against 1.31 under CT. Our estimate shows that shifting from CT to ZT based wheat production reduces GHG emission by 1.5 Mg CO2-eq ha−1 season−1. Overall, ZT has both climate change mitigation and economic benefits, implying the win-win outcome of better agricultural practices.",,English,10.1017/S001447971400012X,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19770,2015,Experimental Agriculture,Cambridge University Press,1-16,rice; wheat; farmers; cropping systems; zero tillage; on-farm research; rice-wheat systems
Quantifying the impact of weather extremes on global food security: A spatial bio-economic approach,"Gbegbelegbe, S.D.; Chung, U.; Shiferaw, B.; Msangi, S.; Tesfaye, K.","This study uses a spatial bio-economic modelling framework to estimate the impact of the 2012 weather extreme in the USA on food security in the developing world. The study also quantifies the potential effects of a similar weather extreme occurring in 2050 under climate change. The study results indicate that weather extremes that affect maize productivity in key grain baskets can negatively affect food security in vulnerable countries. The 2012 weather extreme which occurred in the USA reduced US and global maize production by 29% compared to trend; maize consumption in the country decreased by 5% only and this resulted in less surplus maize for exports from the largest maize exporter in the world. Global maize production decreased by 6% compared to trend. The decrease in global maize production coupled with a reduction in the volume of global maize exports worsened food insecurity in eastern Africa, the Caribbean and Central America and India. The effects of the weather extreme on global food security would be worse, if the latter were to occur under climate change in 2050, assuming no climate change adaptation worldwide over the years. In addition, the hardest-hit regions would remain the same, whether the weather extreme occurs in 2012 instead of 2050: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), South Asia and the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. However, sustained growth in per capita income across world economies between 2000 and 2050 would allow few countries in SSA and the LAC region to virtually eliminate hunger within their borders. In these countries, per capita income would be high enough by 2050 to completely offset the negative effect of the weather extreme. The study results are also consistent with USDA׳s estimates on US and global maize production and consumption in 2012 after the weather extreme. Some discrepancy is found on the volume of global maize trade; this implies that the bio-economic model likely overestimates the effect of the weather extreme on food insecurity. However, the trends from the analysis are likely to be valid. Further research would involve using a CGE model that can capture the net effects of weather extremes.",,English,10.1016/j.wace.2014.05.005,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19736,2014,Weather and Climate Extremes,Elsevier,96-108,bioeconomic models; weather hazards; food security; developing countries; spatial bio-economic modelling; impacts; developing world
"Farmers, food and climate change: ensuring community-based adaptation is mainstreamed into agricultural programmes","Wright, H.; Vermeulen, S.; Laganda, G.; Olupot, M.; Ampaire, E.; Jat, M.L.","Climate change creates widespread risks for food production. As climate impacts are often locally specific, it is imperative that large-scale initiatives to support smallholder farmers consider local priorities and integrate lessons from successful autonomous adaptation efforts. This article explores how large-scale programmes for smallholder adaptation to climate change might link effectively with community-led adaptation initiatives. Drawing on experiences in Bangladesh, Mozambique, Uganda and India, this article identifies key success factors and barriers for considering local priorities, capacities and lessons in large-scale adaptation programmes. It highlights the key roles of extension services and farmers' organizations as mechanisms for linking between national-level and community-level adaptation, and a range of other success factors which include participative and locally driven vulnerability assessments, tailoring of adaptation technologies to local contexts, mapping local institutions and working in partnership across institutions. Barriers include weak governance, gaps in the regulatory and policy environment, high opportunity costs, low literacy and underdeveloped markets. The article concludes that mainstreaming climate adaptation into large-scale agricultural initiatives requires not only integration of lessons from community-based adaptation, but also the building of inclusive governance to ensure smallholders can engage with those policies and processes affecting their vulnerability.",,English,10.1080/17565529.2014.965654,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19735,2014,Climate and Development,Taylor & Francis,318-328,climate change; agriculture; adaptation; community involvement; community-based adaptation; mainstreaming
Identification and risk assessment for worldwide invasion and spread of Tuta absoluta with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa: implications for phytosanitary measures and management,"Tonnang, H.; Mohammed, S.F.; Khamis, F.M.; Ekesi, S.","To support management decisions, molecular characterization of data and geo-reference of incidence records of Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) were combined with data on the biology and ecology of the pest to estimate its climatic suitability and potential spread at regional and global scale. A CLIMEX model was developed and used for the global prediction of current and future climate-induced changes in the distributional shifts of T. absoluta. Results revealed that temperature and moisture characterized T. absoluta population growth while the pest ability to survive the cold, hot, wet and dry stress conditions are the primary characteristics defining its range frontiers. Simulated irrigation also played an important role in the model optimization. Model predictions suggest that T. absoluta represents an important threat to Africa, Asia, Australia, Northern Europe, New Zealand, Russian Federation and the United States of America (USA). Under climate change context, future predictions on distribution of T. absoluta indicated that the invasive nature of this pest will result in significant crop losses in certain locations whereas some parts of Africa may witness diminution in ranges. The following scenarios may occur: 1) T. absoluta damage potential may upsurge moderately in areas of Africa where the pest currently exists; 2) a range diminution in temperate to Sahel region with moderate upsurge in damage potential; 3) a range expansion in tropical Africa with reasonable upsurge of damage potential. These possible outcomes could be explained by the fact that the continent is already warm, with the average temperature in majority of localities near the threshold temperatures for optimal development and survival of T. absoluta. Outputs from this study should be useful in helping decision-makers in their assessment of site-specific risks of invasion and spread of T. absoluta with a view to developing appropriate surveillance, phytosanitary measures and management strategies.",,English,10.1371/journal.pone.0135283,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19726,2015,PLoS ONE,Public Library of Science,,climate change; pest insects; invasive species; population dynamics; simulation models; forecasting
Methodological approach for predicting and mapping the phenological adaptation of tropical maize (Zea mays L.) using multi-environment trials,"Tonnang, H.; Makumbi, D.; Craufurd, P.","Background: The phenological development of the maize crop from emergence through flowering to maturity, usually expressed as a rate (i.e. 1/duration), is largely controlled by temperature in the tropics. Maize plant phenological responses vary between varieties and quantifying these responses can help in predicting the timing and duration of critical periods for crop growth that affect the quality and quantity of seed. We used routine multi-environment trials data of diverse tropical maize varieties to: (1) fit 82 temperature dependent phenology models and select the best model for an individual variety, (2) develop a spatial framework that uses the phenology model to predict at landscape level the length of the vegetative and reproductive phases of diverse varieties of maize in different agro-ecologies. Multi-environment trial data of 22 maize varieties from 16 trials in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Sudan was analyzed and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm combined with statistical criteria was applied to determine the best temperature-dependent model. Results: The Briere model, which is not often used in plant phenology, provided the best fit, with observed and predicted days to flowering showing good agreement. Linking the model with temperature and scaling out through mapping gave the duration from emergence to maturity of different maize varieties in areas where maize could potentially be grown. Conclusion: The methodology and framework used in the study provides an opportunity to develop tools that enhance farmers' ability to predict stages of maize development for efficient crop management decisions and assessment of climate change impacts. This methodology could contribute to increase maize production if used to identify varieties with desired maturity for a specific agro-ecology in in the targeted regions.",,English,10.1186/s13007-018-0375-7,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19690,2018,Plant Methods,BioMed Central,,maize; environmental factors; phenology; landscape; temperature depepndent model; environmental variables; length of growing period
Effect of climate change on spring wheat yields in North America and Eurasia in 1981-2015 and implications for breeding,"Morgounov, A.; Sonder, K.; Abugaliyeva, A.I.; Bhadauria, V.; Cuthbert, R.; Shamanin, V.; Zelenskiy, Y.; DePauw, R.M.","Wheat yield dynamic in Canada, USA, Russia and Kazakhstan from 1981 till 2015 was related to air temperature and precipitation during wheat season to evaluate the effects of climate change. The study used yield data from the provinces, states and regions and average yield from 19 spring wheat breeding/research sites. Both at production and research sites grain yield in Eurasia was two times lower compared to North America. The yearly variations in grain yield in North America and Eurasia did not correlate suggesting that higher yield in one region was normally associated with lower yield in another region. Minimum and maximum air temperature during the wheat growing season (April-August) had tendency to increase. While precipitation in April-August increased in North American sites from 289 mm in 1981-1990 to 338 mm in 2006-2015 it remained constant and low at Eurasian sites (230 and 238 mm, respectively). High temperature in June and July negatively affected grain yield in most of the sites at both continents. Climatic changes resulted in substantial changes in the dates of planting and harvesting normally leading to extension of growing season. Longer planting-harvesting period was positively associated with the grain yield for most of the locations. The climatic changes since 1981 and spring wheat responses suggest several implications for breeding. Gradual warming extends the wheat growing season and new varieties need to match this to utilize their potential. Higher rainfall during the wheat season, especially in North America, will require varieties with higher yield potential responding to moisture availability. June is a critical month for spring wheat in both regions due to the significant negative correlation of grain yield with maximum temperature and positive correlation with precipitation. Breeding for adaptation to higher temperatures during this period is an important strategy to increase yield.",,English,10.1371/journal.pone.0204932,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19665,2018,PLoS ONE,Public Library of Science,,wheat; climate change; adaptation
Impact of climate-change risk-coping strategies on livestock productivity and household welfare: empirical evidence from Pakistan,"Rahut, D.B.; Ali, A.","Using the primary datasets collected from 700 livestock farmers from all four major provinces of Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit Baltistan, this paper analyzes the impact of climate-change risk coping strategies on household welfare. A Poisson regression model was used to estimate the determinants of the livestock ownership and multivariate probit model to assess the determinants of the measures taken to manage the climatic-risk challenge for livestock. A propensity score matching approach (PSM) was used to assess the impact of the adopted climate-risk management strategies on livestock farmers. Findings indicated that in Pakistan livestock farmers generally adopt four main types of strategies to cope with climate risk: livestock insurance, selling of livestock, allocation of more land area for fodder and migration. The results show that age, education, wealth, access to extension services, and membership in NGOs, influence the livestock farmers' choice of climate-risk-coping mechanisms. The livestock farmers who adopted risk-coping mechanisms generally fared better. Increasing the land area allocated to fodder seems to increase production of milk and butter, resulting in higher income and lower poverty levels. Those who bought insurance had more milk production and a lower poverty level, while those who sold livestock to cope with climate risk decreased production but increased household income and lowered poverty levels. Migration seems to have a negative impact on production and income. Impact assessments confirm that purchasing livestock insurance and increasing fodder areas are more effective compared to the selling of livestock and migration. Agricultural climate policy should focus on creating awareness as well as increasing access to extension services among livestock farmers on climate risk and risk-coping strategies to mitigate the impact on rural livelihoods.",,English,10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e00797,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19664,2018,Heliyon,Elsevier,,climate change; livestock production; household; agriculture; environmental sciences
Increasing social-ecological resilience within small-scale agriculture in conflict-affected Guatemala,"Hellin, J.; Ratner, B.D.; Meinzen-Dick, R.; Lopez-Ridaura, S.","Climate change scenarios suggest largely detrimental impacts on agricultural production from a deterioration of renewable natural resources. Over the last 15 years, a new field of research has focused on the interactions between climate and conflict risk, particularly as it relates to competition over natural resources and livelihoods. Within this field, there has been less attention to the potential for resource competition to be managed in ways that yield greater cooperation, local adaptation capacity, social-ecological resilience, and conflict mitigation or prevention. The challenge of increasing social-ecological resilience in small-scale agriculture is particularly acute in the socioeconomically and agroecologically marginalized Western Highlands of Guatemala. Not only is climate change a threat to agriculture in this region, but adaptation strategies are challenged by the context of a society torn apart by decades of violent conflict. Indeed, the largely indigenous population in the Western Highlands has suffered widespread discrimination for centuries. The armed conflict has left a legacy of a deeply divided society, with communities often suspicious of outsider interventions and in many cases with neighbors pitted against each other. We use the example of the Buena Milpa agricultural development project to demonstrate how grassroots approaches to collective action, conflict prevention, and social-ecological resilience, linking local stakeholder dynamics to the broader institutional and governance context, can bear fruit amidst postconflict development challenges. Examples of microwatershed management and conservation of local maize varieties illustrate opportunities to foster community-level climate adaptation strategies within small-scale farming systems even in deeply divided societies.",,English,10.5751/ES-10250-230305,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19662,2018,Ecology and Society,Resilience Alliance,,agriculture; climate change; resilience; conflicts; collective action
Index insurance and climate risk management: addressing social equity,"Fisher, E.; Hellin, J.; Greatrex, H.; Jensen, N.","Fair distribution of benefits from index insurance matters. Lack of attention to social equity can reinforce inequalities and undermine the potential index insurance holds as a tool for climate risk management that is also pro‐poor. The aims of this article are to: (a) examine social equity concerns raised by index insurance in the context of climate risk management, (b) consider how greater attention can be paid to social equity in index insurance initiatives, and (c) reflect on the policy challenges raised by taking social equity into account as a mechanism for climate risk reduction. The article draws on learning from the CGIAR's Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and presents the cases of the Index Based Livelihoods Insurance (IBLI) and Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise Ltd. (ACRE) in East Africa. It proposes a framework for unpacking social equity related to equitable access, procedures, representation and distribution within index insurance schemes. The framework facilitates identification of opportunities for building outcomes that are more equitable, with greater potential for inclusion and fairer distribution of benefits related to index insurance. The article argues that systematically addressing social equity raises hard policy choices for index insurance initiatives without straightforward solutions. Attention to how benefits and burdens of index insurance are distributed, suggests the unpalatable truth for development policy that the poorest members of rural society can be excluded. Nevertheless, a focus on social equity—facilitated by the framework—opens up opportunities to ensure index insurance is linked to more socially just climate risk management. At the very least, it may prevent index insurance from generating greater inequality. Taking social equity into account, thus, shifts the focus from agricultural systems in transition per se to systems with potential to incorporate societal transformation through distributive justice.",,English,10.1111/dpr.12387,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19656,2019,Development Policy Review,Wiley,581-602,social classes; agriculture; climate change; food security; climate-smart agriculture; climate risk management; index insurance; inequality; social equity

Several aspects make it challenging to prioritise CSA research, including its multi-dimensional nature (productivity, adaptation and mitigation), the uncertainty surrounding many climate impacts, and the scale and temporal dependencies that may affect the benefits and costs of CSA adoption. Here we propose a framework for prioritising agricultural research investments across scales and review different approaches to setting priorities among agricultural research projects.

"Adoption of multiple climate-smart agricultural practices in the Gangetic plains of Bihar, India","Aryal, J.P.; Jat, M.L.; Sapkota, T.; Khatri-Chhetri, A.; Kassie, M.; Rahut, D.B.; Maharjan, S.","Purpose: The adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAPs) is important for sustaining Indian agriculture in the face of climate change. Despite considerable effort by both national and international agricultural organizations to promote CSAPs in India, adoption of these practices is low. This study aims to examine the elements that affect the likelihood and intensity of adoption of multiple CSAPs in Bihar, India. Design/methodology/approach: The probability and intensity of adoption of CSAPs are analyzed using multivariate and ordered probit models, respectively. Findings: The results show significant correlations between multiple CSAPs, indicating that their adoptions are interrelated, providing opportunities to exploit the complementarities. The results confirm that both the probability and intensity of adoption of CSAPs are affected by numerous factors, such as demographic characteristics, farm plot features, access to market, socio-economics, climate risks, access to extension services and training. Farmers who perceive high temperature as the major climate risk factor are more likely to adopt crop diversification and minimum tillage. Farmers are less likely to adopt site-specific nutrient management if faced with short winters; however, they are more likely to adopt minimum tillage in this case. Training on agricultural issues is found to have a positive impact on the likelihood and the intensity of CSAPs adoption. Practical implications: The major policy recommendations coming from of our results are to strengthen local institutions (public extension services, etc.) and to provide more training on CSAPs. Originality/value: By applying multivariate and ordered probit models, this paper provides some insights on the long-standing discussions on whether farmers adopt CSAPs in a piecemeal or in a composite way.",,English,10.1108/IJCCSM-02-2017-0025,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19620,2018,International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management,Emerald Publishing Limited,407-427,climate change adaptation; climate-smart agriculture; diversification; minimum tillage; site specific nutrient management; seeds; resistance varieties; climate-smart agricultural practices; crop diversification; stress-tolerant seed varieties
Base temperatures and degrees days development of 10 Mexican corn accessions,"Arista-Cortes, J.; Quevedo-Nolasco, A.; Zamora-Morales, B.P.; Bauer Mengelberg, J.R.; Sonder, K.; Lugo Espinosa, O.","The temperature variation of a place is a function of the elements and factors of the climate, which are altered to a greater or lesser extent by climate change, which is a challenge to determine the periods of thermal growth, optimum sowing for various crops by region. Based on the above, the objective of this study was to determine the base temperature (Tb) and the degree days development (GDD) of the sowing to flowering (male and female) for 10 accessions of corn that are protected in the Germplasm Bank of CIMMYT. The information was collected and analyzed (duration in days (t) of the periods of Sowing to Flowering and its respective average temperature) of different field experiments of the field stations (Agua Fria, Puebla and Tlaltizapan, Morelos) of the years 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013.

Conservation agriculture enhances resistance of maize to climate stress in a Malawian medium-term trial,"Steward, P.; Thierfelder, C.; Dougill, A.J.; Ivy Sichinga Ligowe","Smallholder farming in southern African needs climate-smart agricultural approaches to adapt to current climate stress and climate variability, and increasing risk of these under future global climate change. There are a range of climate-smart systems that have been proposed and conservation agriculture (CA) based on minimum soil disturbance, crop residue retention and crop rotation is one of them. A CA trial established in 2007 in Malawi was used during cropping -seasons 2015–2016 (El Niño) and 2016–2017 (La Niña) to assess the performance and resistance of different CA maize systems under climate-related stress at anthesis, a climate sensitive growth stage. Large in-situ rainout shelters were used to simulate increased daytime temperatures and in-season droughts of 18–19 days and 27 days. CA systems better resisted climate stress around anthesis than conventional tillage practices as CA systems showed greater resistance to drought than conventional practice. This was expressed by higher CA maize grain yields, biomass yields or harvest index under conditions of natural (El Niño) or 19 day simulated drought. However, under 27 day drought simulation the resistance benefit of CA was no-longer significant. Crop diversification improved the resistance of CA systems to climate stress, more so when diversification was over time (rotation) than in space (intercropping). In all years CA systems substantially outyielded conventional practice, this highlights the benefits of medium-term (eight years) CA management before the rainout shelter experiment started. Our results from natural and simulated drought conditions confirm that CA systems can increase adaptive capacity to an increased risk of climate stress associated with projected global climate change. We show that large-scale rainout shelters are a useful means of accelerating our understanding of how long-term agricultural management practices can enhance resistance to climate stresses.",,English,10.1016/j.agee.2018.07.009,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19606,2019,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",Elsevier,95-104,zero tillage; heat stress; climate-smart agriculture; adaptation; rainout shelters; resistance
Harnessing genetic potential of wheat germplasm banks through impact-oriented-prebreeding for future food and nutritional security,"Singh, S.; Vikram, P.; Sehgal, D.; Burgueño, J.; Sharma, A.R.; Singh, S.K.; Sansaloni, C.; Joynson, R.; Brabbs, T.; Ortiz, C.; Solís Moya, E.; Velu, G.; Gupta, N.; Sidhu, H.S.; Basandrai, A.K.; Basandrai, D.; Ledesma-Ramires, L.; Suaste-Franco, M.P.; Fuentes Dávila, G.; Ireta Moreno, J.; Sonder, K.; Vaibhav K.

We used next-generation sequencing, together with multi-environment phenotyping, to study the contribution of exotic genomes to 984 three-way-cross-derived (exotic/elite1//elite2) pre-breeding lines (PBLs). Genomic characterization of these lines with haplotype map-based and SNP marker approaches revealed exotic specific imprints of 16.1 to 25.1%, which compares to theoretical expectation of 25%. A rare and favorable haplotype (GT) with 0.4% frequency in gene bank identified on chromosome 6D minimized grain yield (GY) loss under heat stress without GY penalty under irrigated conditions. More specifically, the ‘T’ allele of the haplotype GT originated in Aegilops tauschii and was absent in all elite lines used in study. In silico analysis of the SNP showed hits with a candidate gene coding for isoflavone reductase IRL-like protein in Ae. tauschii. Rare haplotypes were also identified on chromosomes 1A, 6A and 2B effective against abiotic/biotic stresses. Results demonstrate positive contributions of exotic germplasm to PBLs derived from crosses of exotics with CIMMYT’s best elite lines.

Facilitating change for climate-smart agriculture through science-policy engagement,"Dinesh, D.; Zougmore, R.B.; Vervoort, J.; Totin, E.; Thornton, P.; Solomon, D.; Shirsath, P.B.; Pede, V.O.; Lopez Noriega, I.; Laderach, P.; Korner, J.; Hegger, D.; Girvetz, E.; Friis, A.E.; Driessen, P.P.J.; Campbell, B.M.","Climate change impacts on agriculture have become evident, and threaten the achievement of global food security. On the other hand, the agricultural sector itself is a cause of climate change, and if actions are not taken, the sector might impede the achievement of global climate goals. Science-policy engagement efforts are crucial to ensure that scientific findings from agricultural research for development inform actions of governments, private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international development partners, accelerating progress toward global goals. However, knowledge gaps on what works limit progress. In this paper, we analyzed 34 case studies of science-policy engagement efforts, drawn from six years of agricultural research for development efforts around climate-smart agriculture by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). Based on lessons derived from these case studies, we critically assessed and refined the program theory of the CCAFS program, leading to a revised and improved program theory for science-policy engagement for agriculture research for development under climate change. This program theory offers a pragmatic pathway to enhance credibility, salience and legitimacy of research, which relies on engagement (participatory and demand-driven research processes), evidence (building scientific credibility while adopting an opportunistic and flexible approach) and outreach (effective communication and capacity building).",,English,10.3390/su10082616,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19579,2018,Sustainability,MDPI,2616,climate change; agriculture; agricultural research for development; adaptation; climate change mitigation; food security; climate-smart agriculture; science-policy interface; science-policy engagement

Excessive pruning and limited regeneration: are Faidherbia albida parklands heading for extinction in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia?,"Sida, T.S.; Baudron, F.; Dejene Adugna Deme; Motuma Tolera; Giller, K.E.","Scattered Faidherbia albida trees provide multiple ecological and production benefits across the Sahel. The intensive management and use of this important tree may impede its regeneration. Regeneration bottlenecks were explored and population dynamics modelled. On experimental plots in which seed of F. albida was sown, exposure to the first 2 months of dry season resulted in a quarter of seedling mortality. Exposure to season-long free grazing and browsing caused significantly greater seedling mortality. Results from monitoring 100 permanent plots scattered over the landscape showed that adult population density was 4.2 ± 0.3 (mean ± SE) trees ha?1 and dominated by old age classes. Sixty percent of the total population were older than 30 years. The mean density for juveniles was 1.4 ± 0.2 (mean ± SE) individuals ha?1. The annual rates of decline were 1.2%, 51.3%, and 63.2% for adults, seedlings, and saplings, respectively. Our model predicted that the F. albida population will start to decline within 1?2 decades to eventually fall below 1 tree ha?1 within 60 years under current management. The model highlighted that the limited seed source, caused by excessive pruning, was the main constraint for recruitment. Appropriate land management policy to ensure adequate seed production would avert current trends in decline of F. albida population.",,English,10.1002/ldr.2959,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19529,2018,Land Degradation and Development,John Wiley and Sons,1623-1633,agrobiodiversity; climate change; faidherbia albida
IPM to control soil-borne pests on wheat and sustainable food production,"Dababat, A.A.; Erginbas Orakci, G.; Toumi, F.; Braun, H.J.; Morgounov, A.; Sikora, R.A.","Soil Borne Pathogens (SBPs) including the Heterodera species, cereal cyst nematode (CCN), Pratylenchus species, root lesion nematode and crown rot (CR) caused by Fusarium species, attack the roots of cereal crops resulting in a high yield loss and reduced grain quality and quantity. The damage caused by these diseases is accelerated in areas where water stress and monoculture practices dominate. Sustainable agriculture production of rain-fed crop exposed to drought, especially those growing under arid and semi-arid conditions, is being impacted by climate change due to hotter and drier soils. It is important to recognize that a plant's ability to secure adequate amounts of water is severely impacted by the destabilizing effects of nematodes and root rotting fungi on root architecture. Integrated crop health management approaches, using both modern cultivars with resistance/tolerance to these organisms, as well as, technologies that stimulate root health and growth coupled with modern nematode management strategies such as chemical, biological and cultural are needed for sustainable production in the ever-drier environments that are now a reality in many areas of the world. Resistance is environmentally friendly and biologically effective once identified. However, resistance has only been identified against one of the CCN species found in Turkey; Heterodera filipjevi. This resistance is not yet present in the varieties widely grown in the region. Therefore, alternative approaches to limit the damage caused by SBPs are needed. Extensive screening of wheat germplasm against SBPs has identified many moderately resistant germplasm in winter and spring wheat germplasm. However, CR remains a significant bottleneck in many wheat-growing areas around the world. Hundreds of wheat lines are screened annually for SBP at CIMMYT Turkey in collaboration with the Grains Research Development Corporation and many new moderately resistant to resistant lines have been identified. A number of these sources of resistance are new and previously unreported QTL's have been identified through association mapping. The new sources of resistance to the SBPs that may be useful for selecting parents and deploying resistance into elite germplasm adapted to regions where it is a problem. Nematologists, breeders and agronomists need to work together to find solution to the complex issues facing agricultural production and use multidisciplinary approaches to move forward in insuring food security for all. Recent research within the SBP program of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) has focused on germplasm screening, the potential of this germplasm as source of resistance, and how to incorporate the new sources of resistance into breeding programs. Breeding for resistance is particularly complicated and difficult when different species and pathotypes coexist in nature. Other current and future research will address the use of endophytic microorganisms and other cultural practices to the yield losses incurred by SBPs. There is currently insufficient breeding for resistance to SBPs due to a lack of expertise and recognition of SBPs as a factor limiting wheat production potential, inappropriate breeding strategies, slow screening processes, and increased research funding is required for a more holistic approach to plant health management.",,English,10.22268/AJPP-036.1.037044,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19525,2018,Arab Journal of Plant Protection,Arab Society for Plant Protection,37-44,infectious diseases; wheat; soilborne organisms; disease control; soil pathogens; germplasm screening
Optimizing winter wheat resilience to climate change in rain fed crop systems of Turkey and Iran,"Lopes, M.; Royo, C.; Álvaro, F.; Sanchez-Garcia, M.; Ozer, E.; Ozdemir, F.; Karaman, M.; Roostaei, M.; Jalal Kamali, M.R.; Pequeno, D.N.L.","Erratic weather patterns associated with increased temperatures and decreasing rainfall pose unique challenges for wheat breeders playing a key part in the fight to ensure global food security. Within rain fed winter wheat areas of Turkey and Iran, unusual weather patterns may prevent attaining maximum potential increases in winter wheat genetic gains. This is primarily related to the fact that the yield ranking of tested genotypes may change from one year to the next. Changing weather patterns may interfere with the decisions breeders make about the ideotype(s) they should aim for during selection. To inform breeding decisions, this study aimed to optimize major traits by modeling different combinations of environments (locations and years) and by defining a probabilistic range of trait variations [phenology and plant height (PH)] that maximized grain yields (GYs; one wheat line with optimal heading and height is suggested for use as a testing line to aid selection calibration decisions). Research revealed that optimal phenology was highly related to the temperature and to rainfall at which winter wheat genotypes were exposed around heading time (20 days before and after heading). Specifically, later winter wheat genotypes were exposed to higher temperatures both before and after heading, increased rainfall at the vegetative stage, and reduced rainfall during grain filling compared to early genotypes. These variations in exposure to weather conditions resulted in shorter grain filling duration and lower GYs in long-duration genotypes. This research tested if diversity within species may increase resilience to erratic weather patterns. For the study, calculated production of a selection of five high yielding genotypes (if grown in five plots) was tested against monoculture (if only a single genotype grown in the same area) and revealed that a set of diverse genotypes with different phenologies and PHs was not beneficial. New strategies of progeny selection are discussed: narrow range of variation for phenology in families may facilitate the discovery and selection of new drought-resistant and avoidant wheat lines targeting specific locations.",,English,10.3389/fpls.2018.00563,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19516,2018,Frontiers in Plant Science,Frontiers,,climate change; rainfall patterns; yield factors; resilience; adaptation; heading; low rainfall; reproductive stage; vegetative stage; within species diversity
"Nitrous oxide (N2O) flux responds exponentially to nitrogen fertilizer in irrigated wheat in the Yaqui Valley, Mexico","Millar, N.; Urrea, A.; Kahmark, K.; Shcherbar, I.; Robertson, G.; Ortiz-Monasterio, I.","The Yaqui Valley, one of Mexico's major breadbaskets, includes ?230,000 ha of cultivated, irrigated cropland, with two thirds of the area planted annually to spring wheat (Triticum turgidum). Nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications to wheat have doubled since the 1980s, and currently average around 300 kg N ha?1. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, increase following soil management activities, especially irrigation when N fertilizer is applied, and particularly when N fertilizer inputs exceed crop N requirements. Here we investigate trade?offs among N fertilizer inputs, spring wheat yields, and N2O emissions to inform management strategies that can mitigate N2O emissions without compromising yields, and link this to how farmers can generate carbon credits from N management to receive payment for more precise N use. We used static chambers to measure N2O fluxes from spring wheat at five N fertilizer rates (0, 80, 160, 240, and 280 kg N ha?1) during two growing seasons at CIMMYT in Ciudad Obregon, Sonora, Mexico. Average daily fluxes were between 1.9 ± 0.5 and 13.4 ± 2.8 g N2O-N ha?1, with lower emissions at N rates below those that maximized yield, and substantially higher emissions at N rates beyond maximum yield; this exponential response is consistent with crops in temperate regions. Results suggest that current average N fertilizer rates (300 kg N ha?1) are at least double economically optimum rates, resulting in low crop N use efficiency: 36?39% at higher N rates as compared to 50?57% for economically optimum rates. N fertilizer rate reductions to the economic optimum rates here (123 and 145 kg N ha?1 in 2013 and 2014, respectively) could have avoided N2O emissions equivalent to 0.5 to 0.8 Mg CO2e ha?1 yr?1 or, regionally, 84?138 Gg CO2e yr?1 without harming yields. Insofar as fertilizer use in Yaqui Valley is likely similar to high-productivity irrigated cereal systems elsewhere, our results provide evidence for a global triple-win scenario: large reductions in agricultural GHG emissions, increased farmer income, and continued high productivity.",,English,10.1016/j.agee.2018.04.003,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19498,2018,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",Elsevier Masson,125-132,nitrous oxide; nitrogen fertilizers; climate change mitigation; greenhouse gases; irrigation; carbon market; greenhouse gas
Sub-Saharan African maize-based foods: technological perspectives to increase the food and nutrition security impacts of maize breeding programmes,"Ekpa, O.; Palacios-Rojas, N.; Kruseman, G.; Fogliano, V.; Linnemann, A.","The demand for maize in Sub-Saharan Africa will triple by 2050 due to rapid population growth, while challenges from climate change will threaten agricultural productivity. Most maize breeding programmes have focused on improving agronomic properties and have paid relatively little attention to postharvest qualities, thus missing important opportunities to increase the contribution to food and nutrition security. This paper considers current and potential food uses of maize in Africa and proposes six objectives to enhance the contribution of maize breeding programmes to food and nutrition security: (1) enhance nutrient density; (2) enhance suitability for use in bread and snacks; (3) improve characteristics for consumption as green maize; (4) improve characteristics that enhance the efficiency of local processing; (5) reduce waste by maximising useful product yield and minimising nutrient losses; (6) reduce the anti-nutrient content of grain.",,English,10.1016/j.gfs.2018.03.007,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19492,2018,Global Food Security,Elsevier,48-56,maize; plant breeding; supply chains; consumer behaviour; maize based foods; maize breeding; maize value chain; consumer preferences
Multi-objective land use allocation modelling for prioritizing climate-smart agricultural interventions,"Dunnett, A.; Shirsath, P.B.; Aggarwal, P.K.; Thornton, P.; Joshi, P.K.; Pal, B.D.; Khatri-Chhetri, A.; Ghosh, J.","Climate-smart interventions in agriculture have varying costs and environmental and economic impacts. Their implementation requires appropriate investment decisions by policy makers that are relevant for current as well as future scenarios of agro-ecology, climate and economic development. Decision support tools are therefore needed to assist different stakeholders to prioritize and hence implement appropriate strategic interventions. These interventions transform agriculture ecosystems to climate-resilient, adaptive and efficient. This paper outlines the mathematical modelling framework of one such, the Climate Smart Agricultural Prioritization (CSAP) toolkit. This toolkit employs a dynamic, spatially-explicit multi-objective optimization model to explore a range of agricultural growth pathways coupled with climate-adaptation strategies to meet agricultural development and environmental goals. The toolkit consists of three major components: (i) land evaluation including assessment of resource availability, land suitability, yield and input-output estimation for all promising crop production practices and technologies for key agro-ecological units; (ii) formulation of scenarios based on policy views and development plans; and (iii) land-use optimization in the form of linear programming models. Climate change and socio-economic drivers condition the land evaluation, technological input-output relations, and specification of optimization objectives that define modelled scenarios. By integrating detailed bottom-up biophysical, climate impact and agricultural-emissions models, CSAP is capable of supporting multi-objective analysis of agricultural production goals in relation to food self-sufficiency, incomes, employment and mitigation targets, thus supporting a wide range of analyses ranging from food security assessment to environmental impact assessment to preparation of climate smart development plans.",,English,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.04.008,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19491,2018,Ecological Modelling,Elsevier,23-35,climate-smart agriculture; climate change; adaptation; prioritization; mitigation; optimization
Temperature-dependent phenology of Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae): simulation and visualization of current and future distributions along the Eastern Afromontane,"Ngowi, B.V.; Tonnang, H.; Mwangi, E.M.; Johansson, T.; Ambale, J.; Ndegwa, P.N.; Sevgan, S.","There is a scarcity of laboratory and field-based results showing the movement of the diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (L.) across a spatial scale. We studied the population growth of the diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (L.) under six constant temperatures, to understand and predict population changes along altitudinal gradients and under climate change scenarios. Non-linear functions were fitted to continuously model DBM development, mortality, longevity and oviposition. We compiled the best-fitted functions for each life stage to yield a phenology model, which we stochastically simulated to estimate the life table parameters. Three temperature-dependent indices (establishment, generation and activity) were derived from a logistic population growth model and then coupled to collected current (2013) and downscaled temperature data from AFRICLIM (2055) for geospatial mapping. To measure and predict the impacts of temperature change on the pest’s biology, we mapped the indices along the altitudinal gradients of Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania) and Taita Hills (Kenya) and assessed the differences between 2013 and 2055 climate scenarios. The optimal temperatures for development of DBM were 32.5, 33.5 and 33°C for eggs, larvae and pupae, respectively. Mortality rates increased due to extreme temperatures to 53.3, 70.0 and 52.4% for egg, larvae and pupae, respectively. The net reproduction rate reached a peak of 87.4 female offspring/female/generation at 20°C. Spatial simulations indicated that survival and establishment of DBM increased with a decrease in temperature, from low to high altitude. However, we observed a higher number of DBM generations at low altitude. The model predicted DBM population growth reduction in the low and medium altitudes by 2055. At higher altitude, it predicted an increase in the level of suitability for establishment with a decrease in the number of generations per year. If climate change occurs as per the selected scenario, DBM infestation may reduce in the selected region. The study highlights the need to validate these predictions with other interacting factors such as cropping practices, host plants and natural enemies.",,English,10.1371/journal.pone.0173590,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19485,2017,PLoS ONE,Public Library of Science,,plutella xylostella; climate change adaptation; tortricidae
Threats of tar spot complex disease of maize in the United States of America and its global consequences,"Mottaleb, K.A.; Loladze, A.; Sonder, K.; Kruseman, G.; San Vicente Garcia, F.M.","The emergence and spread of new crop diseases threatens the global food security situation. Phyllachora maydis, one of the three fungal pathogens involved in Tar Spot Complex (TSC) of maize, a disease native to Latin American countries, was detected for the first time in the United States of America (USA) in 2015. Although TSC has been previously reported to cause up to 50% of yield losses in maize in Latin America, the impact of P. maydis alone on maize yield is not known yet. However, there is a possibility that Monographella maydis, the second most important pathogen involved in TSC, would be introduced to the USA and would become associated with P. maydis and both pathogens could form the devastating complex disease in the country. The first objective of this study was to identify the TSC-vulnerable maize-producing regions across the USA by applying a climate homologue modeling procedure. The second objective was to quantify the potential economic impact of the disease on the maize industry in the USA. This study showed that even a 1% loss in maize production caused by the disease could potentially lead to a reduction in maize production by 1.5 million metric tons of grain worth US$231.6 million. Such production losses will affect not only the maize-related industries in the USA but also the food security in a number of low-income countries that are heavily dependent on US maize imports. This, in turn, may lead to increased poverty and starvation and, in some cases, to social unrest due to increased prices of maize-based staple foods. The study is intended to raise public awareness regarding potential TSC outbreaks and to develop strategies and action plans for such scenarios.",,English,10.1007/s11027-018-9812-1,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19481,2019,Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,Springer Verlag,281–300,maize; biotic stress; climate change; food security; plant diseases; corn; tar spot complex; ex-ante impact; global impact; new plant diseases
Stay-green and associated vegetative indices to breed maize adapted to heat and combined Heat-Drought Stresses,"Cerrudo, D.; González Pérez, L.; Mendoza, A.; Trachsel, S.","The objective of this study was to assess the importance of stay-green on grain yield under heat and combined heat and drought stress and to identify the associated vegetative indices allowing higher throughput in order to facilitate the identification of climate resilient germplasm. Hybrids of tropical and subtropical adaptation were evaluated under heat and combined heat and drought stress in 2014 and 2015. Five weekly measurements with an airplane mounted multispectral camera starting at anthesis were used to estimate the area under the curve (AUC) for vegetation indices during that period; the indices were compared to the AUC (AUCSEN) for three visual senescence scores taken two, four, and six weeks after flowering and a novel stay-green trait (AUC for stay-green; AUCSG) derived from AUCSEN by correcting for the flowering date. Heat and combined heat and drought stress reduced grain yield by 53% and 82% (relative to non-stress trials reported elsewhere) for trials carried out in 2014 and 2015, respectively, going along with lower AUCSG in 2014. The AUCSG was consistently correlated with grain yield across trials and years, reaching correlation coefficients of 0.55 and 0.56 for 2014 and 2015, respectively. The AUC for different vegetative indices, AUCNDVI (rgGY = 0.62; rgAUCSG = 0.72), AUCHBSI (rgGY = 0.64; rgAUCSG = 0.71), AUCGRE (rgGY = 0.57; rgAUCSG = 0.61), and AUCCWMI (rgGY = 0.63; rgAUCSG = 0.75), were associated with grain yield and stay-green across experiments and years. Due to its good correlation with grain yield and stay-green across environments, we propose AUCNDVI for use as an indicator for stay-green and a long grain filling. The trait AUCNDVI can be used in addition to grain yield to identify climate-resilient germplasm in tropical and subtropical regions to increase food security in a changing climate",,English,10.3390/rs9030235,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19360,2017,Remote Sensing,MDPI,1-13,maize; climate change; breeding; normalized difference vegetation index; cwmi; ndvi; gre; hsbi; stay-green

We compared different cultivars, soils, and fertilizer options in three planting seasons.We analyzed the simulated yields to spatially classify high-impact spots of climate change across the four countries. The results show a corridor of reduced yields from Lake Nicaragua to central Honduras (10–38 % decrease). Yields increased in the Guatemalan highlands, towards the Atlantic coast, and in southern Nicaragua (10–41 % increase).

Exploring the potential of household methodologies to strengthen gender equality and improve smallholder livelihoods: research in Malawi in maize-based systems,"Farnworth, C.; Stirling, C.; Chinyophiro, A.; Namakhoma, A.; Morahan, R.","Household methodologies (HHM) intervene directly in intra-household gender relations to strengthen overall smallholder agency and efficacy as economic agents and development actors. Strengthening women's agency is one mechanism for progressing towards collaborative, systemic farm management. It is expected this will contribute to improved farm resilience in the face of climate change, strengthen food and nutrition security, and improve other development indicators. HHM are built around a vision, gendered analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT), an action plan, and indicators. Some HHM - including Gender Action Learning Systems (GALS), the focus of the research - use drawings making them easy to use for low-literate individuals. There is considerable evaluation report evidence of the efficacy of HHM in strengthening value chains, food security, and gender equality. However, this has yet to be complemented by a robust systematic evaluation of the methodology which includes non-intervention communities as controls. Here we report on the findings of a research study into GALS in Malawi where the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi (NASFAM) has been implementing GALS since 2013 with 4274 farmers (2821 women and 1453 men to May 2016). We held sex-disaggregated FGDs with 40 GALS households and 40 non-GALS households, all NASFAM members. Community profiles and a matrix activity focusing on task allocation, asset distribution, and expenditures by gender with 125 non-GALS and 135 GALS respondents were also conducted. Our analyses indicate a significant shift towards sharing of on-farm tasks and household tasks, and joint realization of the benefits from agricultural produce in GALS households. They are building up portfolios of assets including livestock, houses, ox-carts, and land, unlike non-GALS households. Respondents in GALS households, particularly de facto women-headed households, report an increase in social standing and participation in community life. In both GALS and non-GALS households, men and women agree that men continue to dominate marketing and are final decision-makers.

It aims to scale up and scale out the appropriate options and draw out lessons for policy makers from local to global levels. The approach incorporates evaluation of climate-smart technologies, practices, services, and processes relevant to local climatic risk management and identifies opportunities for maximizing adaptation gains from synergies across different interventions and recognizing potential maladaptation and trade-offs. It ensures that these are aligned with local knowledge and link into development plans. This paper describes early results in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to illustrate different examples of the CSV approach in diverse agroecological settings. Results from initial studies indicate that the CSV approach has a high potential for scaling out promising climate-smart agricultural technologies, practices, and services. Climate analog studies indicate that the lessons learned at the CSV sites would be relevant to adaptation planning in a large part of global agricultural land even under scenarios of climate change. Key barriers and opportunities for further work are also discussed.",,English,10.5751/ES-09844-230114,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19344,2018,Ecology and Society,Resilience Alliance,,adaptation; climate change; climate-smart agriculture; resilience; climate-smart villages; scaling out
Rapid breeding and varietal replacement are critical to adaptation of cropping systems in the developing world to climate change,"Atlin, G.; Cairns, J.E.; Das, B.","Plant breeding is a key mechanism for adaptation of cropping systems to climate change. Much discussion of breeding for climate change focuses on genes with large effects on heat and drought tolerance, but phenology and stress tolerance are highly polygenic. Adaptation will therefore mainly result from continually adjusting allele frequencies at many loci through rapid-cycle breeding that delivers a steady stream of incrementally improved cultivars. This will require access to elite germplasm from other regions, shortened breeding cycles, and multi-location testing systems that adequately sample the target population of environments. The objective of breeding and seed systems serving smallholder farmers should be to ensure that they use varieties developed in the last 10 years. Rapid varietal turnover must be supported by active dissemination of new varieties, and active withdrawal of obsolete ones. Commercial seed systems in temperate regions achieve this through competitive seed markets, but in the developing world, most crops are not served by competitive commercial seed systems, and many varieties date from the end of the Green Revolution (the late 1970s, when the second generation of modern rice and wheat varieties had been widely adopted). These obsolete varieties were developed in a climate different than today's, placing farmers at risk. To reduce this risk, a strengthened breeding system is needed, with freer international exchange of elite varieties, short breeding cycles, high selection intensity, wide-scale phenotyping, and accurate selection supported by genomic technology. Governments need to incentivize varietal release and dissemination systems to continuously replace obsolete varieties.",,English,10.1016/j.gfs.2017.01.008,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19303,2017,Global Food Security,Elsevier,31-37,cropping systems; climate change adaptation; plant breeding; variety choice; germplasm; genetic gain; seeds; rapid crop breeding; varietal replacement; germplasm exchange; seed systems
Prioritizing climate-smart agricultural land use options at a regional scale,"Shirsath, P.B.; Aggarwal, P.K.; Thornton, P.; Dunnett, A.","The promotion of climate-smart agriculture in different parts of the world requires a clear understanding of its relative suitability, costs and benefits, and the environmental implications of various technological interventions in a local context under current and future climates. Such data are generally difficult to obtain from the literature, field surveys and focused group discussions, or from biophysical experiments. This article describes a spreadsheet-based methodology that generates this information based on a region specific production function and ‘target yield’ approach in current and future climate scenarios. Target yields are identified for homogeneous agroecological spatial units using published crop yield datasets, crop models, expert judgement, biophysical land characterisations, assessment of yield gaps and future development strategies. Validated production/transfer functions are used to establish relationships between inputs (water, seed, fertilizer, machinery, energy, labour, costs) and outputs (crop yields, residues, water and fertiliser use efficiencies, greenhouse gas emissions, financial returns). The process is repeated for all spatial units of the region, identified through detailed mapping of critical biophysical factors, and for all suitable current and potential agronomic production technologies and practices. The application of this approach is illustrated for prioritizing agronomic interventions that can enhance productivity and incomes, help farmers adapt to current risk, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions in current and future climates for the flood- and drought-prone state of Bihar in north-eastern India. In general, climate smartness increases with advanced technologies. Yield is the least limiting while emission is the most limiting factor across the entire crop-technology portfolio for climate smartness. Finally, we present a robust climate smart land use plan at district level in Bihar under current and future climate scenarios.",,English,10.1016/j.agsy.2016.09.018,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19273,2017,Agricultural Systems,Elsevier,174-183,climate change; adaptation; databases; land use planning; mitigation; prioritization; database development
Using satellite data to identify the causes of and potential solutions for yield gaps in India’s Wheat Belt,"Meha Jain; Singh, B.; Srivastava, A.; Malik, R.; Mcdonald, A.; Lobell, D.B.","Food security will be increasingly challenged by climate change, natural resource degradation, and population growth. Wheat yields, in particular, have already stagnated in many regions and will be further affected by warming temperatures. Despite these challenges, wheat yields can be increased by improving management practices in regions with existing yield gaps. To identify the magnitude and causes of current yield gaps in India, one of the largest wheat producers globally, we produced 30 meter resolution yield maps from 2001 to 2015 across the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), the nation’s main wheat belt. Yield maps were derived using a new method that translates satellite vegetation indices to yield estimates using crop model simulations, bypassing the need for ground calibration data. This is one of the first attempts to apply this method to a smallholder agriculture system, where ground calibration data are rarely available. We find that yields can be increased by 11% on average and up to 32% in the eastern IGP by improving management to current best practices within a given district. Additionally, if current best practices from the highest-yielding state of Punjab are implemented in the eastern IGP, yields could increase by almost 110%. Considering the factors that most influence yields, later sow dates and warmer temperatures are most associated with low yields across the IGP. This suggests that strategies to reduce the negative effects of heat stress, like earlier sowing and planting heattolerant wheat varieties, are critical to increasing wheat yields in this globally-important agricultural region.",,English,10.1088/1748-9326/aa8228,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19257,2017,Environmental Research Letters,IOP Publishing,,smallholders; yield gap; food security; remote sensing; wheat; smallholder farms
Meteorological drought assessment in north east highlands of Ethiopia,"Mohammed, Y.; Fantaw Yimer; Tadesse, M.; Tesfaye, K.","The purpose of this paper is to investigate the patterns and trends of drought incidence in north east highlands of Ethiopia using monthly rainfall record for the period 1984-2014. Design/methodology/approach Standard precipitation index and Mann – Kendal test were used to analyze drought incident and trends of drought occurrences, respectively. The spatial extent of droughts in the study area has been interpolated by inverse distance weighted method using the spatial analyst tool of ArcGIS. Findings Most of the studied stations experienced drought episodes in 1984, 1987/1988, 1992/1993, 1999, 2003/2004 and 2007/2008 which were among the worst drought years in the history of Ethiopia. The year 1984 was the most drastic and distinct-wide extreme drought episode in all studied stations. The Mann–Kendal test shows an increasing tendencies of drought at three-month (spring) timescale at all stations though significant (p < 0.05) only at Mekaneselam and decreasing tendencies at three-month (summer) and 12-month timescales at all stations. The frequency of total drought was the highest in central and north parts of the region in all study seasons.

Advances in crop insect modelling methods—Towards a whole system approach,"Tonnang, H.; Bisseleua, D.H.B.; Biber-Freudenberger, L.; Salifu, D.; Sevgan, S.; Ngowi, B.V.; Guimapi, R.Y.A.; Bruce, A.Y.; Kakmeni, F.M.M.; Affognon, H.D.; Niassy, S.; Landmann, T.; Ndjomatchoua, F.; Pedro, S.A.; Johansson, T.; Tanga, C.M.; Nana, P.; Fiaboe, K.M.; Mohamed, S.F.; Maniania, N.; Nedorezov, L.V.; Ekesi, S.; Borgemeister, C.","A wide range of insects affect crop production and cause considerable yield losses. Difficulties reside on the development and adaptation of adequate strategies to predict insect pests for their timely management to ensure enhanced agricultural production. Several conceptual modelling frameworks have been proposed, and the choice of an approach depends largely on the objective of the model and the availability of data. This paper presents a summary of decades of advances in insect population dynamics, phenology models, distribution and risk mapping. Existing challenges on the modelling of insects are listed; followed by innovations in the field. New approaches include artificial neural networks, cellular automata (CA) coupled with fuzzy logic (FL), fractal, multi-fractal, percolation, synchronization and individual/agent-based approaches. A concept for assessing climate change impacts and providing adaptation options for agricultural pest management independently of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenarios is suggested. A framework for estimating losses and optimizing yields within crop production system is proposed and a summary on modelling the economic impact of pests control is presented. The assessment shows that the majority of known insect modelling approaches are not holistic; they only concentrate on a single component of the system, i.e. the pest, rather than the whole crop production system. We suggest system thinking as a possible approach for linking crop, pest, and environmental conditions to provide a more comprehensive assessment of agricultural crop production.",,English,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.03.015,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19218,2017,Ecological Modelling,Elsevier,88-103,integrated pest management; crop production; climate change; impact assessment; yield losses; systems analysis; insect modelling approaches; system thinking
"Crop breeding chips and genotyping platforms: progress, challenges, and perspectives","Rasheed, A.; Yuanfeng Hao; Xianchun Xia; Khan, Awais; Yunbi Xu; Varshney, R.K.; He Zhonghu","There is a rapidly rising trend in the development and application of molecular marker assays for gene mapping and discovery in field crops and trees. Thus far, more than 50 SNP arrays and 15 different types of genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) platforms have been developed in over 25 crop species and perennial trees. However, much less effort has been made on developing ultra-high-throughput and cost-effective genotyping platforms for applied breeding programs. In this review, we discuss the scientific bottlenecks in existing SNP arrays and GBS technologies and the strategies to develop targeted platforms for crop molecular breeding. We propose that future practical breeding platforms should adopt automated genotyping technologies, either array or sequencing based, target functional polymorphisms underpinning economic traits, and provide desirable prediction accuracy for quantitative traits, with universal applications under wide genetic backgrounds in crops. The development of such platforms faces serious challenges at both the technological level due to cost ineffectiveness, and the knowledge level due to large genotype–phenotype gaps in crop plants. It is expected that such genotyping platforms will be achieved in the next ten years in major crops in consideration of (a) rapid development in gene discovery of important traits, (b) deepened understanding of quantitative traits through new analytical models and population designs, (c) integration of multi-layer -omics data leading to identification of genes and pathways responsible for important breeding traits, and (d) improvement in cost effectiveness of large-scale genotyping. Crop breeding chips and genotyping platforms will provide unprecedented opportunities to accelerate the development of cultivars with desired yield potential, quality, and enhanced adaptation to mitigate the effects of climate change.",,English,10.1016/j.molp.2017.06.008,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19123,2017,Molecular Plant,Elsevier,1047-1064,single nucleotide polymorphism; plant breeding; genetic markers; innovation platforms; genotyping by sequencing; snp arrays; crop breeding; genotyping platforms
Potential benefits of drought and heat tolerance for adapting maize to climate change in tropical environments,"Tesfaye, K.; Kruseman, G.; Cairns, J.E.; Zaman-Allah, M.; Dagne Wegary Gissa; Zaidi, P.; Boote, K.; Rahut, D.B.; Erenstein, O.","Climate change and population growth pose great challenges to the food security of the millions of people who grow maize in the already fragile agricultural systems in tropical environments. There is an urgent need for maize varieties that are both drought and heat tolerant given the already prevailing drought and heat stress levels in many tropical environments, which are set to exacerbate with climate change. In this study, the crop growth simulation model for maize (CERES-Maize) was used to quantify the impact of climate change on maize and the potential benefits of incorporating drought and heat tolerance into the commonly grown (benchmark) maize varieties at six sites in Eastern and Southern Africa and one site in South Asia. Simulation results indicate that climate change will have a negative impact on maize yield at all the sites studied but the degree of the impact varies with location, level of warming and rainfall changes. Combined hotter and drier climate change scenarios (involving increases in warming with a reduction in rainfall) resulted in greater average simulated maize yield reduction (21, 33 and 50% under 1, 2 and 4 °C warming, respectively) than hotter only climate change scenarios (11, 21 and 41%, respectively). Incorporating drought, heat and combined drought & heat tolerance into benchmark varieties increased simulated maize yield under both the baseline and future climates. The average simulated benefit from combined drought & heat tolerance was at least twice that of heat or drought tolerance and it increased with the increase in warming levels. The magnitude of the simulated benefits from drought tolerance, heat tolerance and combined drought & heat tolerance and potential acceptability of the varieties by farmers varied across sites and climate scenarios indicating the need for proper targeting of varieties where they fit best and benefit most. It is concluded that incorporating drought and heat tolerance into maize germplasm has the potential to offset predicted yield losses and sustain maize productivity under climate change in vulnerable sites.",,English,10.1016/j.crm.2017.10.001,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19083,2018,Climate Risk Management,Elsevier,106-119,climate change; maize; drought tolerance; heat tolerance; tropical zones; tropical environments
"Climate smart agriculture, farm household typologies and food security An ex-ante assessment from Eastern India","Lopez-Ridaura, S.; Frelat, R.; Wijk, M. van; Valbuena, D.; Krupnik, T.J.; Jat, M.L.","One of the great challenges in agricultural development and sustainable intensification is the assurance of social equity in food security oriented interventions. Development practitioners, researchers, and policy makers alike could benefit from prior insight into what interventions or environmental shocks might differentially affect farmers' food security status, in order to move towards more informed and equitable development. We examined the food security status and livelihood activities of 269 smallholder farm households (HHs) in Bihar, India. Proceeding with a four-step analysis, we first applied a multivariate statistical methodology to differentiate five primary farming system types. We next applied an indicator of food security in the form of HH potential food availability (PFA), and examined the contribution of crop, livestock, and on- and off-farm income generation to PFA within each farm HH type. Lastly, we applied scenario analysis to examine the potential impact of the adoption of ‘climate smart’ agricultural (CSA) practices in the form of conservation agriculture (CA) and improved livestock husbandry, and environmental shocks on HH PFA. Our results indicate that compared to livestock interventions, CA may hold considerable potential to boost HH PFA, though primarily for wealthier and medium-scale cereal farmers. These farm HH types were however considerably more vulnerable to food insecurity risks resulting from simulated drought, while part-time farmers and resource-poor agricultural laborers generating income from off-farm pursuits were comparatively less vulnerable, due in part to their more diversified income sources and potential to migrate in search of work. Our results underscore the importance of prior planning for development initiatives aimed at increasing smallholder food security while maintaining social equity, while providing a robust methodology to vet the implications of agricultural interventions on an ex ante basis.",,English,10.1016/j.agsy.2017.09.007,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19084,2018,Agricultural Systems,Elsevier,pages 57-68,climate change; conservation agriculture; livestock; drought; socio-ecological system; scenario evaluation
Identifying high-yield low-emission pathways for the cereal production in South Asia,"Sapkota, T.; Aryal, J.P.; Khatri-Chhetri, A.; Shirsath, P.B.; Arumugam, P.; Stirling, C.","Increasing agricultural production to meet the growing demand for food whilst reducing agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is the major challenge under the changing climate. To develop long-term policies that address these challenges, strategies are needed to identify high-yield low-emission pathways for particular agricultural production systems. In this paper, we used bio-physical and socio-economic models to analyze the impact of different management practices on crop yield and emissions in two contrasting agricultural production systems of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) of India. The result revealed the importance of considering both management and socio-economic factors in the development of high-yield low-emission pathways for cereal production systems. Nitrogen use rate and frequency of application, tillage and residue management and manure application significantly affected GHG emissions from the cereal systems. In addition, various socio-economic factors such as gender, level of education, training on climate change adaptation and mitigation and access to information significantly influenced the adoption of technologies contributing to high-yield low-emission pathways.

In this study, crosses were designed to complement “source” with “sink” traits, where at least one parent was selected for favorable expression of biomass and/or radiation use efficiency—source—and the other for sink-related traits like harvest-index, kernel weight and grains per spike. Female parents were selected from among genetic resources—including landraces and products of wide-crossing (i.e. synthetic wheat)—that had been evaluated in Mexico at high yield potential or under heat stress, while elite lines were used as males. Progeny of crosses were advanced to the F4 generation within Mexico, and F4-derived F5 and F6 generations were yield tested to populate four international nurseries, targeted to high yield environments (2nd and 3rd WYCYT) for yield potential, and heat stressed environments (2nd and 4th SATYN) for climate resilience, respectively. Each nursery was grown as multi-location yield trials. Genetic gains were achieved in both temperate and hot environments, with most new PT-derived lines expressing superior yield and biomass compared to local checks at almost all international sites. Furthermore, the tendency across all four nurseries indicated either the superiority of the best new PT lines compared with the CIMMYT elite checks, or the superiority of all new PT lines as a group compared with all checks, and in some cases, both. Results support—in a realistic breeding context—the hypothesis that yield and radiation use efficiency can be increased by improving source:sink balance, and validate the feasibility of incorporating exotic germplasm into mainstream breeding efforts to accelerate genetic gains for yield potential and climate resilience.",,English,10.1007/s10681-017-2040-z,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/19081,2017,Euphytica,Springer,pages 1-23,plant physiology; plant breeding; yield potential; heat; climate change; resilience; physiological breeding; climate resilience; pre-breeding; rapid cycle breeding

Long-term climate data analysis can identify climate risks and anticipate new ones for planning appropriate adaptation and mitigation options. The aim of this study was to identify near-term (2030) and mid-term (2050) climate risks and/or opportunities in the state of Bihar, one of India’s most populous and poorest states, using weather data for 30 years (1980–2009) as a baseline. Rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures, and evapotranspiration will all increase in the near- and mid-term periods relative to the baseline period, with the magnitude of the change varying with time, season and location within the state. Bihar’s major climate risks for crop production will be heat stress due to increasing minimum temperatures in the rabi (winter) season and high minimum and maximum temperatures in the spring season; and intense rainfall and longer dry spells in the kharif (monsoon) season. The increase in annual and seasonal rainfall amounts, and extended crop growing period in the kharif season generally provide opportunities; but increasing temperature across the state will have considerable negative consequences on (staple) crops by affecting crop phenology, physiology and plant-water relations.

The adaptive capacity of maize-based conservation agriculture systems to climate stress in tropical and subtropical environments: a meta-regression of yields,"Steward, P.; Dougill, A.J.; Thierfelder, C.; Pittelkow, C.M.; Stringer, L.C.; Kudzala, M.; Shackelford, G.E.","Conservation agriculture is widely promoted across sub-Saharan Africa as a sustainable farming practice that enhances adaptive capacity to climate change. The interactions between climate stress, management, and soil are critical to understanding the adaptive capacity of conservation agriculture. Yet conservation agriculture syntheses to date have largely neglected climate, especially the effects of extreme heat. For the sub-tropics and tropics, we use meta-regression, in combination with global soil and climate datasets, to test four hypotheses: (1) that relative yield performance of conservation agriculture improves with increasing drought and temperature stress; (2) that the effects of moisture and temperature stress exposure interact; (3) that the effects of moisture and temperature stress are modified by soil texture; and (4) that crop diversification, fertilizer application rate, or the time since no-till implementation will enhance conservation agriculture performance under climate stress. Our results support the hypothesis that the relative maize yield performance of conservation agriculture improves with increasing drought severity or exposure to high temperatures. Further, there is an interaction of moisture and heat stress on conservation agriculture performance and their combined effect is both non-additive and modified by soil clay content, supporting our second and third hypotheses. Finally, we found only limited support for our fourth hypothesis as (1) increasing nitrogen application rates did not improve the relative performance of conservation agriculture under high heat stress; (2) crop diversification did not notably improve conservation agriculture performance, but did increase its stability with heat stress; and (3) a statistically robust effect of the time since no-till implementation was not evident. Our meta-regression supports the narrative that conservation agriculture enhances the adaptive capacity of maize production in sub-Saharan Africa under drought and/or heat stress.

Implications of high temperature and elevated CO2 on flowering time in plants,"Jagadish, K.S.V.; Bahuguna, R.N.; Djanaguiraman, M.; Gamuyao, R.; Prasad, P.V.V.; Craufurd, P.","Flowering is a crucial determinant for plant reproductive success and seed-set. Increasing temperature and elevated carbon-dioxide (e[CO2]) are key climate change factors that could affect plant fitness and flowering related events. Addressing the effect of these environmental factors on flowering events such as time of day of anthesis (TOA) and flowering time (duration from germination till flowering) is critical to understand the adaptation of plants/crops to changing climate and is the major aim of this review. Increasing ambient temperature is the major climatic factor that advances flowering time in crops and other plants, with a modest effect of e[CO2].Integrated environmental stimuli such as photoperiod, temperature and e[CO2] regulating flowering time is discussed. The critical role of plant tissue temperature influencing TOA is highlighted and crop models need to substitute ambient air temperature with canopy or floral tissue temperature to improve predictions. A complex signaling network of flowering regulation with change in ambient temperature involving different transcription factors (PIF4, PIF5), flowering suppressors (HvODDSOC2, SVP, FLC) and autonomous pathway (FCA, FVE) genes, mainly from Arabidopsis, provides a promising avenue to improve our understanding of the dynamics of flowering time under changing climate. Elevated CO2 mediated changes in tissue sugar status and a direct [CO2]-driven regulatory pathway involving a key flowering gene, MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (MFT), are emerging evidence for the role of e[CO2] in flowering time regulation.",,English,10.3389/fpls.2016.00913,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/18866,2016,Frontiers in Plant Science,Frontiers,,climate change; flowering; heat stress; carbon dioxide; heat tolerance; flowering time; flowering regulation; high temperature; elevated co2; tissue temperature
Climate change skepticism and index versus standard crop insurance demand in coastal Bangladesh,"Akter, S.; Krupnik, T.J.; Khanam, F.","This paper investigates if climate change skepticism, farmers’ fatalistic beliefs, and insurance plan design influence interest in crop weather insurance. While studies of the influence of fatalism on disaster preparedness are common, the ways in which fatalism influences climate change skepticism, and in turn affects farmers’ interest in crop insurance, have not been previously investigated. An additional objective was to understand farmers’ preferences for index versus standard insurance options, the former entailing damage compensation based on post-hazard assessment, the latter tying damage compensation to a set of weather parameter thresholds. A discrete choice experiment was conducted with maize farmers on a climate-risk prone island in coastal Bangladesh. Most farmers were insurance averse. Those who chose insurance were however significantly more likely to select standard as opposed to index-based insurance. Insurance demand was significantly and positively correlated with farmers’ concern about the adverse livelihood impacts of climate change. Farmers who exhibited fatalistic views regarding the consequences of climate change were significantly less likely to opt for insurance of either kind. These findings imply that the prospect for farmers’ investment in insurance is conditioned by their understanding of climate change risks and the utility of adaptation, in addition to insurance scheme design.",,English,10.1007/s10113-017-1174-9,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/18868,2017,Regional Environmental Change,Springer Verlag,2455-2466,climate change adaptation; maize; agricultural insurance; disaster preparedness; farmers' attitudes; weather index insurance; skepticism; choice experiment
Smallholder farmer innovation and contexts in maize-based Conservation Agriculture Systems in Central Malawi,"Kaluzi, L.; Thierfelder, C.; Hopkins, D.W.","The increased threat of food insecurity and climate change requires more sustainable ways of agriculture intensification in African smallholder farming systems. Ample evidence confirms that maize-based conservation agriculture (CA) systems lead to increased soil health and yield enhancement yet their overall uptake remains low in Africa. An array of studies on challenges and solutions to CA systems conducted in southern Africa principally focussed on the views of scientists, often neglecting the views of CA farmers. Therefore, this study assessed farmer decision making, innovation and contexts during implementation of maize-based CA systems in communities of central Malawi. A survey involving interviews with 226 CA farmers was deployed, triangulated with key informants comprising extension workers and policy makers. The study showed that about 58% of smallholder farmers did not adapt CA practices to their circumstances because they were strictly following change agents’ recommendations. The major challenge noted was competition for crop residues due to mice hunters and grazing livestock. Local by-laws initiated by the communities have started to privatise the crop residues and its grazing. However, other innovations were often not documented by extension workers, consequently neglecting more than half of the potential solutions provided by farmers. The establishments of a National Conservation Agriculture Task Force and CA guidelines are positive developments for coordination of stakeholders and harmonisation of CA messages in Malawi. However, for greater adoption, non-linear interaction and learning must be encouraged in practice by fully embracing innovative farmers and the voices of the pool of stakeholders with varying experiences.",,English,10.5539/sar.v6n3p85,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/18864,2017,Sustainable Agriculture Research,Canadian Center of Science and Education,pages 85-105,maize; agricultural innovation systems; innovation adoption; conservation agriculture; decision making; adapting; adoption

A more internationally coordinated approach to crop phenotyping and modeling, combined with effective sharing of knowledge, facilities, and data, will boost the cost effectiveness and facilitate genetic gains of all staple crops, with likely spill over to more neglected crops.",,English,10.1016/j.gfs.2016.02.002,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/18841,2016,Global Food Security,Elsevier,9-18,cereals; production; climate change; yields; networks; phenotypes; phenotyping platforms
Assessing farmer use of climate change adaptation practices and impacts on food security and poverty in Pakistan,"Ali, A.; Erenstein, O.","Climate change is set to be particularly disruptive in poor agricultural communities. We assess the factors influencing farmers’ choice of climate change adaptation practices and associated impacts on household food security and poverty in Pakistan using comprehensive data from 950 farmers from its major provinces. A probit model was used to investigate the factors influencing the use of climate-change adaptation practices; the censored least absolute deviation (CLAD) was used to analyze the determinants of the number of adaptation practices used; and a propensity score matching (PSM) approach was employed to evaluate the impact of adaptation practices on food security and poverty levels. Adjustment in sowing time (22% households), use of drought tolerant varieties (15%) and shifting to new crops (25%) were the three major adaptation practices used by farmers in the study area. Results show that younger farmers and farmers with higher levels of education are more likely to use these adaptation practices, as do farmers that are wealthier, farm more land and have joint families. The number of adaptation practices used was found to be positively associated with education, male household heads, land size, household size, extension services, access to credit and wealth. Farmers adopting more adaptation practices had higher food security levels (8–13%) than those who did not, and experienced lower levels of poverty (3–6%). Climate change adaptation practices at farm level can thereby have significant development outcomes in addition to reducing exposure to weather risks.",,English,10.1016/j.crm.2016.12.001,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/18617,2017,Climate Risk Management,Elsevier,183-194,climate change; food security; poverty; statistical methods; propensity score matching
Greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural food production to supply Indian diets: Implications for climate change mitigation,"Vetter, S.H.; Sapkota, T.; Hillier, J.; Stirling, C.; Macdiarmid, J.I.; Aleksandrowicz, L.; Green, R.; Joy, E.; Dangour, A.; Smith, P.","Agriculture is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. The growing global population is putting pressure on agricultural production systems that aim to secure food production while minimising GHG emissions. In this study, the GHG emissions associated with the production of major food commodities in India are calculated using the Cool Farm Tool. GHG emissions, based on farm management for major crops (including cereals like wheat and rice, pulses, potatoes, fruits and vegetables) and livestock-based products (milk, eggs, chicken and mutton meat), are quantified and compared. Livestock and rice production were found to be the main sources of GHG emissions in Indian agriculture with a country average of 5.65 kg CO2eq kg−1 rice, 45.54 kg CO2eq kg−1 mutton meat and 2.4 kg CO2eq kg−1 milk. Production of cereals (except rice), fruits and vegetables in India emits comparatively less GHGs with <1 kg CO2eq kg−1 product. These findings suggest that a shift towards dietary patterns with greater consumption of animal source foods could greatly increase GHG emissions from Indian agriculture. A range of mitigation options are available that could reduce emissions from current levels and may be compatible with increased future food production and consumption demands in India.",,English,10.1016/j.agee.2016.12.024,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/18610,2017,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",Elsevier Masson,234-241,greenhouse gases; food production; climate change mitigation; agriculture; sustainability; cool farm tool; indian diets
Soil organic carbon changes after seven years of conservation agriculture in a rice–wheat system of the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains,"Sapkota, T.; Jat, R.K.; Singh, R.G.; Jat, M.L.; Stirling, C.; Jat, M.K.; Bijarniya, D.; Kumar, M.; Yadvinder-Singh; Saharawat, Y.S.; Gupta, R.K.","Sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important strategy to improve soil quality and to mitigate climate change. To investigate changes in SOC under conservation agriculture (CA), we measured SOC concentrations after seven years of rice (Oryza sativa L.)–wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotations in the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of India under various combinations of tillage and crop establishment methods. The six treatments were as follows: conventional till transplanted rice followed by conventional till wheat (CTR-CTW), CTR followed by zero-till wheat (CTR-ZTW), ZT direct-seeded rice followed by CTW (ZTDSR-CTW), ZTDSR followed by ZT wheat both on permanent raised beds with residue (PBDSR-PBW+R), and ZTDSR followed by ZTW both with (ZTDSR-ZTW+R) and without residues (ZTDSR-ZTW). We hypothesized that CA systems (i.e. ZT with residue retention) would sequester more carbon (C) than CT. After seven years, ZTDSRZTW+ R and PBDSR-PBW+R increased SOC at 0–0.6 m depth by 4.7 and 3.0 t C/ha, respectively, whereas the CTR-CTW system resulted in a decrease in SOC of 0.9 t C/ha. Over the same soil depth, ZT without residue retention (ZTDSR-ZTW) only increased SOC by 1.1 t C/ha. There was no increase in SOC where ZT in either rice or wheat was followed by CT in the next crop (i.e. CTRZTW and ZTDSR-CTW), most likely because the benefit of ZT is lost when followed by tillage. Tillage and crop establishment methods had no significant effect on the SOC stock below the 0.15-m soil layer. Over the seven years, the total carbon input from above-ground residues was ca. 14.5 t/ha in ZTDSR-ZTW+R and PBDSR-PBW+R, almost sixfold greater than in the other systems. Our findings suggest that the increased biomass production achieved through a combination of ZT and partial residue retention offers an opportunity to increase SOC whilst allowing residues to be used for other purposes.",,English,10.1111/sum.12331,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/18543,2017,Soil Use and Management,Wiley,81-89,soil organic carbon; tillage; crop residues; sustainable agriculture; agricultural sustainability
Germinate 3: development of a common platform to support the distribution of experimental data on crop wild relatives,"Shaw, P.D.; Raubach, S.; Hearne, S.; Dreher, K.; Glenn Bryan; McKenzie, G.; Milne, I.; Stephen, G.; Marshall, D.S.","Conservation and exploitation of crop wild relative species is an important component in ensuring food security and improving current agricultural output. By identifying agriculturally important characteristics that express favorable response to both biotic and abiotic stress currently unused by breeders, the incorporation of this new genetic material into genetic background stocks may help mitigate problems imposed by climate change, land degradation, and population pressure. This is particularly important in countries that will be more severely affected by the threat of reduced yields. The ability to effectively manage genetic resources collections and integrate unique and diverse data types is crucial in exploring, understanding, and exploiting the diversity contained within genebanks. Providing a common interface through which experimental and background data can be disseminated to both researchers and breeders will bring focus and facilitate community building into research communities. We have taken wild barley (Hordeum spp.) and potato (Solanum spp.) collections along with wheat (Triticum spp.) and maize (Zea mays subsp. mays) and their wild relatives and incorporated this data into web-based information resources built using the Germinate platform (https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/get-germinate, accessed 4 Apr. 2017).

Genomic prediction models for grain yield of spring bread wheat in diverse agro-ecological zones,"Saint Pierre, C.; Burgueño, J.; Fuentes Dávila, G.; Figueroa, P.; Solís Moya, E.; Ireta Moreno, J.; Hernández Muela, V.M.; Zamora Villa, V.; Vikram, P.; Mathews, K.L.; Sansaloni, C.; Sehgal, D.; Jarquin, D.; Wenzl, P.; Singh, S.; Crossa, J.","Genomic and pedigree predictions for grain yield and agronomic traits were carried out using high density molecular data on a set of 803 spring wheat lines that were evaluated in 5 sites characterized by several environmental co-variables. Seven statistical models were tested using two random cross-validations schemes. Two other prediction problems were studied, namely predicting the lines’ performance at one site with another (pairwise-site) and at untested sites (leave-one-site-out). Grain yield ranged from 3.7 to 9.0 t ha−1 across sites. The best predictability was observed when genotypic and pedigree data were included in the models and their interaction with sites and the environmental co-variables. The leave-one-site-out increased average prediction accuracy over pairwise-site for all the traits, specifically from 0.27 to 0.36 for grain yield. Days to anthesis, maturity, and plant height predictions had high heritability and gave the highest accuracy for prediction models. Genomic and pedigree models coupled with environmental co-variables gave high prediction accuracy due to high genetic correlation between sites. This study provides an example of model prediction considering climate data along-with genomic and pedigree information. Such comprehensive models can be used to achieve rapid enhancement of wheat yield enhancement in current and future climate change scenario.",,English,10.1038/srep27312,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/18329,2016,Scientific Reports,Nature Publishing Group,,genomics; forecasting; statistical methods; soft wheat; ancestry
Farmers' prioritization of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) technologies,"Khatri-Chhetri, A.; Aggarwal, P.K.; Joshi, P.K.; Vyas, S.","Addressing climate change impacts on agriculture is special challenge. There are number of factors that influence the extent to which farmers in a particular location adopt CSA technologies. This study applied a participatory assessment method to assess farmers' preferences and willingness-to-pay for selected CSA practices and technologies in diverse rainfall zones. The study found that farmers' preferences for CSA technologies are marked by some commonalities as well as differences according to their socio-economic characteristics and rainfall zones. The most preferred technologies by local farmerswere crop insurance, weather-based crop agro-advisories, rainwater harvesting, site-specific integrated nutrient management, contingent crop planning and laser land levelling. The results also indicate that farmers' preferences and willingness-to-pay are influenced by technologies and their cost of implementation.

Gender and inorganic nitrogen: what are the implications of moving towards a more balanced use of nitrogen fertilizer in the tropics?,"Farnworth, C.; Stirling, C.; Sapkota, T.; Jat, M.L.; Misiko, M.T.; Attwood, S.","For agriculture to play a role in climate change mitigation strategies to reduce emissions from inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizer through a more balanced and efficient use are necessary. Such strategies should align with the overarching principle of sustainable intensification and will need to consider the economic, environmental and social trade-offs of reduced fertilizer-related emissions. However, the gender equity dimensions of such strategies are rarely considered. The case studies cited in this paper, from India, Lake Victoria in East Africa and more broadly from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), show that the negative externalities of imbalanced inorganic N use in high- and low-use scenarios impact more strongly on women and children. We examine, through a literature review of recent work in SSA, the relative jointness of intra-household bargaining processes in low N use scenarios to assess the degree to which they impact upon N use. We suggest that genderequitable strategies for achieving more balanced use of N will increase the likelihood of attaining macro-level reductions in GHG emissions provided that they secure equity in intra-household decision-making and address food security. Gender-equitable N use efficiency strategies will help to integrate and assure gender and social equity co-benefits at local scales.",,English,10.1080/14735903.2017.1295343,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/18266,2017,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,Taylor & Francis,136-152,inorganic fertilizers; nitrogen; nutrient use efficiency; mitigation; gender; emission reduction; development; nitrogen use efficiency; low-emissions development

Envirotyping for deciphering environmental impacts on crop plants,Yunbi Xu,"Global climate change imposes increasing impacts on our environments and crop production. To decipher environmental impacts on crop plants, the concept “envirotyping” is proposed, as a third “typing” technology, complementing with genotyping and phenotyping. Environmental factors can be collected through multiple environmental trials, geographic and soil information systems, measurement of soil and canopy properties, and evaluation of companion organisms. Envirotyping contributes to crop modeling and phenotype prediction through its functional components, including genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI), genes responsive to environmental signals, biotic and abiotic stresses, and integrative phenotyping. Envirotyping, driven by information and support systems, has a wide range of applications, including environmental characterization, GEI analysis, phenotype prediction, near-iso-environment construction, agronomic genomics, precision agriculture and breeding, and development of a four-dimensional profile of crop science involving genotype (G), phenotype (P), envirotype (E) and time (T) (developmental stage). In the future, envirotyping needs to zoom into specific experimental plots and individual plants, along with the development of high-throughput and precision envirotyping platforms, to integrate genotypic, phenotypic and envirotypic information for establishing a high-efficient precision breeding and sustainable crop production system based on deciphered environmental impacts.",,English,10.1007/s00122-016-2691-5,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/18194,2016,Theoretical and Applied Genetics,Springer,653-673,environmental impact assessment; climate change; genotype environment interaction; crops; landscape-scale crop

Future risks of pest species under changing climatic conditions,"Biber-Freudenberger, L.; Ziemacki, J.; Tonnang, H.; Borgemeister, C.","Most agricultural pests are poikilothermic species expected to respond to climate change. Currently, they are a tremendous burden because of the high losses they inflict on crops and livestock. Smallholder farmers in developing countries of Africa are likely to suffer more under these changes than farmers in the developed world because more severe climatic changes are projected in these areas. African countries further have a lower ability to cope with impacts of climate change through the lack of suitable adapted management strategies and financial constraints. In this study we are predicting current and future habitat suitability under changing climatic conditions for Tuta absoluta, Ceratitis cosyra, and Bactrocera invadens, three important insect pests that are common across some parts of Africa and responsible for immense agricultural losses. We use presence records from different sources an bioclimatic variables to predict their habitat suitability using the maximum entropy modelling approach.We find that habitat suitability for B. invadens, C. cosyra and T. absoluta is partially increasing across the continent, especially in those areas already overlapping with or close to most suitable sites under current climate conditions. Assuming a habitat suitability at three different threshold levels we assessed where each species is likely to be present under future climatic conditions and if this is likely to have an impact on productive agricultural areas.

Further, multiple abiotic challenges due to climate change and evolving pathogen and pests pose a major concern for increasing wheat production globally. Triticeae species comprising of primary, secondary, and tertiary gene pools represent a rich source of genetic diversity in wheat. The conventional breeding strategies of direct hybridization, backcrossing and selection have successfully introgressed a number of desirable traits associated with grain yield, adaptation to abiotic stresses, disease resistance, and bio-fortification of wheat varieties. However, it is time consuming to incorporate genes conferring tolerance/resistance to multiple stresses in a single wheat variety by conventional approaches due to limitations in screening methods and the lower probabilities of combining desirable alleles. Efforts on developing innovative breeding strategies, novel tools and utilizing genetic diversity for new genes/alleles are essential to improve productivity, reduce vulnerability to diseases and pests and enhance nutritional quality. New technologies of high-throughput phenotyping, genome sequencing and genomic selection are promising approaches to maximize progeny screening and selection to accelerate the genetic gains in breeding more productive varieties.

"Soil and water conservation on Central American hillsides: if more technologies is the answer, what is the question?","Hellin, J.; Lopez-Ridaura, S.","Climate change is likely to lead to increased water scarcity in the coming decades and to changes in patterns of precipitation. The result will be more short-term crop failures and long-term production declines. Improved soil management is key to climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. There is growing interest in the promotion of climate smart agricultural practices. Many of these are the same practices that were promoted in the 1980s and 1990s under the guise of soil and water conservation. Farmer non-adoption of soil conservation technologies was rife and suggests that different approaches are needed today. Much can be learnt from these past endeavors to ensure that current efforts are better designed and implemented. We use the example of Central America to highlight some of these lessons and suggest alternative ways forward. Technology per se is not the limiting factor; many suitable technologies and practices are extant. What is required is a more nuanced approach to soil conservation efforts. There is a need to focus less on capturing soil once it has been eroded, via the use of cross-slope soil conservation practices, and more on improving soil quality of the soil that remains through improved soil cover. It is also critical to understand farming systems as a whole i.e. the full range of interlinked activities and the multiplicity of goals that farm households pursue. Furthermore, it is important to engage farmers as active players in conservation efforts rather than passive adopters of technologies, and to adopt a board value chain approach and engage a plethora of value chain actors (researchers, extension agents, equipment manufacturers, input suppliers, farmers, traders, and processors) in an agricultural innovation system.",,English,10.3934/agrfood.2016.2.194,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/17052,2016,AIMS Agriculture and Food,AIMS Press,194-207,soil conservation; climate change; farming systems; farmer participation; agricultural innovation systems
The influence of gender and product design on farmers’ preferences for weather-indexed crop insurance,"Akter, S.; Krupnik, T.J.; Rossi, F.J.; Khanam, F.","Theoretically, weather-index insurance is an effective risk reduction option for small-scale farmers in low income countries. Renewed policy and donor emphasis on bridging gender gaps in development also emphasizes the potential social safety net benefits that weather-index insurance could bring to women farmers who are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change risk and have low adaptive capacity. To date, no quantitative studies have experimentally explored weather-index insurance preferences through a gender lens, and little information exists regarding gender-specific preferences for (and constraints to) smallholder investment in agricultural weather-index insurance. This study responds to this gap, and advances the understanding of preference heterogeneity for weather-index insurance by analysing data collected from 433 male and female farmers living on a climate change vulnerable coastal island in Bangladesh, where an increasing number of farmers are adopting maize as a potentially remunerative, but high-risk cash crop. We implemented a choice experiment designed to investigate farmers’ valuations for, and trade-offs among, the key attributes of a hypothetical maize crop weather-index insurance program that offered different options for bundling insurance with financial saving mechanisms. Our results reveal significant insurance aVersion among female farmers, irrespective of the attributes of the insurance scheme. Heterogeneity in insurance choices could however not be explained by differences in men’s and women’s risk and time preferences, or agency in making agriculturally related decisions. Rather, gendered differences in farmers’ level of trust in insurance institutions and financial literacy were the key factors driving the heterogeneous preferences observed between men and women. Efforts to fulfill gender equity mandates in climate-smart agricultural development programs that rely on weather-index insurance as a risk-abatement tool are therefore likely to require a strengthening of institutional credibility, while coupling such interventions with financial literacy programs for female farmers.",,English,10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2016.03.010,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/17049,2016,Global Environmental Change,Elsevier,217-229,gender; farmers; weather; crops

We compared different cultivars, soils, and fertilizer options in three planting seasons. We analyzed the simulated yields to spatially classify high-impact spots of climate change across the four countries. The results show a corridor of reduced yields from Lake Nicaragua to central Honduras (10–38 % decrease). Yields increased in the Guatemalan highlands, towards the Atlantic coast, and in southern Nicaragua (10–41 % increase).

Rainfall data of >30 years for seven locations were used to evaluate dry soil planting opportunities on Vertisols. Three rainfall related risks were evaluated: (i) seed lies in dry soil without imbibing water for >20 days (Risk I); (ii) rainfall causes germination but fails to support growth and many seedlings die (Risk II); and (iii) when planting is delayed until after onset of rains by not dry soil planting sorghum or maize and because the fields are too wet to prepare and plant (Risk III). Risk I and II are associated with potential failure of dry soil planting while Risk III is associated with negative consequences of not dry soil planting. Mean probabilities of occurrence of risks associated with dry soil planting were, respectively: ≥50% and ≤30% for Risk I in 25% and 56% of the timeframe; ≥50% and ≤30% for Risk II in 35% and 22% of the timeframe; and ≤30% for Risk III in 90% of the timeframe. The cumulative value of the three risk types were represented by two risk indexes. Dry soil planting was found to have a high probability of success, even when done before the expected onset of rainfall for several locations. Farmers cannot avoid all risk types and risks occur with wet soil planting as well. Guidelines to timeliness of dry soil planting for early crop establishment were developed for each location.",,English,,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/16935,2015,International Journal of Agronomy and Agricultural Research,International Network for Natural Sciences,14-23,risk; dry farming; climate change; arid zones; vertisols; climate variability; dry soil planting; dryland crop production; vertisol
Potential impact of climate change trends on wheat production and mitigation strategies in Afghanistan,"Sharma, R.; Sonder, K.; Gbegbelegbe, S.D.","Climate change is here and continues unabated. It is expected to affect different biological processes differently. Afghanistan has a varied climate profile and depends heavily on wheat, the staple food of its 30 million people. The irrigated wheat occupying about 1.35 million hectare and contributes major chunk of wheat to national granaries compared to rainfed wheat which is more opportunistic with an unpredictable and uncertain share in national harvest. Previous decades have already seen a reduction of up to 100 mm wheat season rainfall and more reductions are estimated by 2050. Also, wheat which is a cool season crop and is also estimated to face higher temperatures by up to 5 degree Celsius across several provinces in the country. The study predicts variable impact of the estimated changes on the productivity of irrigated and rainfed wheat in Afghanistan.",,English,10.5539/jas.v7n4p40,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/16923,2015,Journal of Agricultural Science,Canadian Center of Science and Education,40-47,wheat; climate change; production; temperature; rain; rainfall
Field-scale modeling of tree–crop interactions: Challenges and development needs,"Luedeling, E.; Smethurst, P.J.; Baudron, F.; Bayala, J.; Huth, N.I.; Meine van Noordwijk; Ong, C.K.; Mulia, R.; Lusiana, B.; Muthuri, C.; Sinclair, F.","Agroforestry has attracted considerable attention in recent years because of its potential to reduce poverty, improve food security, reduce land degradation and mitigate climate change. However, progress in promoting agroforestry is held back because decision-makers lack reliable tools to accurately predict yields from tree-crop mixtures. Amongst the key challenges faced in developing such tools are the complexity of agroforestry, including interactions between various system components, and the large spatial domains and timescales over which trees and crops interact. A model that is flexible enough to simulate any agroforestry system globally should be able to address competition and omplementarity above and below ground between trees and crops for light, water and nutrients. Most agroforestry practices produce multiple products including food, fiber and fuel, as well as income, shade and other ecosystem services, all of which need to be simulated for a comprehensive understanding of the overall system to emerge. Several agroforestry models and model families have been developed, including SCUAF, HyPAR, Hi-SAFE/Yield- SAFE andWaNuLCAS, but as of 2015 their use has remained limited for reasons including insufficient flexibility, restricted ability to simulate interactions, extensive parameterization needs or lack of model maintenance. An efficient approach to improving the flexibility and durability of agroforestry models is to integrate theminto awellestablishedmodular cropmodeling framework like APSIM. This framework currently focuses on field-scale crops and pastures, but has the capability to reuse or interoperate with existing models including tree, livestock and landscapemodels, it uses parameters that are intuitive and relatively easy to measure, and it allows scenario analysis that can include farm-scale economics. Various types of agroforestry systems are currently being promoted in many contexts, and the impacts of these innovations are often unclear. Rapid progress in reliable modeling of tree and crop performance for such systems is needed to ensure that agroforestry fulfills its potential to contribute to reducing poverty, improving food security and fostering ustainability.",,English,10.1016/j.agsy.2015.11.005,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/16824,2016,Agricultural Systems,Elsevier,51-69,agroforestry; simulation models; modelling; apsim; biophysical; process-based; wanulcas
Analysis of risks in crop production due to climate change in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia,"Getachew, H.; Tesfaye, K.","This study was conducted to investigate historical climate dynamics and the resultant risks at four sites (Meki, Melkassa, Miesso and Ziway) in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia. It involved analysis of rainfall and temperature data in the study areas. The results showed the existence of high inter-annual rainfall variability within seasons and sites. The number of rainy days exhibited a declining trend at Meki in both belg (FMAM) and kiremt (JJAS) seasons and an increasing trend at Melkassa in the belg season; while an increasing trend was observed at Miesso and Ziway in the kiremt season, and no change in trends was observed in the belg season at both sites. The minimum and maximum temperature showed an increasing trend at Miesso and Ziway, whereas no change was observed at Melkassa. As opposed to the cessation of the rainfall, onset dates of rainfall were highly variable at all sites. The median length of the growing period was found to be 101, 88, 118 and 104 days at Meki, Melkassa, Miesso and Ziway, respectively.

Soil water crop modeling for decision support in millet-based systems in the Sahel: a challenge,"Akponikpe, I.; Gerard, B.; Bielders, C.","Food insecurity in the Sahelian environment was extensively shown to be a result of low soil fertility and high climate risks. But decisions and recommendations made from the great wealth of research have little been adopted by farmers. Soil water crop models (SWCM) can assist researchers and development actors in this environment if they can appropriately deal with the constraints and mainly farmers’ agricultural development goals. We reviewed the Sahelian agricultural constraints and farmer management practices with an emphasis on Niger and pearl millet. Significant results derived from research works to improve crop productivity are presented and analyzed with regard to the main agricultural constraints. Potential and currently used SWCMs are presented and compared for relevance for use in such a particular environment for decision support (DS). This shows that crop modeling in millet-based agricultural system of the Sahel should be addressed with an integrated approach that can handle the multiple and usually connected agricultural constraints of the region: low soil fertility and spatial variability, time and space rainfall variability. Recommendations were made regarding the relevant and minimum aspects that SWCM should take into account for a successful and reliable use for DS in the complex Sahelian environment.",,English,10.5897/AJAR10.263,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/4640,2014,African Journal of Agricultural Research,Academic Journals,1700-1713,rainfall patterns; simulation; nutrients; climate change; weather hazards; soil fertility; rainfall variability; climatic risks
A short-term assessment of carbon dioxide fluxes under contrasting agricultural and soil management practices in Zimbabwe,"O'dell, D.; Sauer, T.J.; Hicks, B.; Thierfelder, C.; Lambert, D.; Logan, J.; Eash, N.S.","Two of the biggest problems facing humankind are feeding an exponentially growing human population and preventing the accumulation of atmospheric greenhouse gases and its climate change consequences. Refined agricultural practices could address both of these problems. The research addressed here is an exploration of the efficacy of alternative agricultural practices in sequestering carbon (C). The study was conducted in Zimbabwe with the intent to (a) demonstrate the utility of micrometeorological methods for measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange between the surface and the atmosphere in the short-term, and (b) to quantify differences in such exchange rates for a variety of agricultural practices. Four Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems were established on the following agricultural management practices: (1) no-till (NT) followed by planting of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum), (2) NT followed by planting of blue lupin (Lupinus angustifolios L.), (3) maize crop residue (Zea mays L.) left on the surface, and (4) maize crop residue incorporated with tillage. Over a period of 139 days (from 15 June to 31 October 2013) the winter wheat cover crop produced a net accumulation of 257 g CO2-C m-2, while the tilled plot with no cover crop produced a net emission of 197 g CO2-C m-2 and the untilled plot with no cover emitted 235 g CO2-C m-2. The blue lupin cover crop emitted 58 g CO2-C m-2, indicating that winter cover crops can sequester carbon and reduce emissions over land left fallow through the non-growing season. The micrometeorological methods described in this work can detect significant differences between treatments over a period of a few months, an outcome important to determine which smallholder soil management practices can contribute towards mitigating climate change.",,English,10.5539/jas.v7n3p32,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/4555,2015,Journal of Agricultural Science,Canadian Center of Science and Education,32-48,agronomic practices; crop management; carbon dioxide; conservation agriculture; greenhouse gas emissions; smallholders; agricultural management practice; co2 flux; smallholder farmers
"Climate change adaptation, greenhouse gas mitigation and economic profitability of conservation agriculture: some examples from cereal systems of Indo-Gangetic plains","Sapkota, T.; Jat, M.L.; Aryal, J.P.; Jat, R.K.; Khatri-Chhetri, A.","Achieving sustainability of the cereal system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of India under progressive climate change and variability necessitates adoption of practices and technologies that increase food production, adaptation and mitigation in a sustainable way. This paper examines CA from the perspective of: (i) increased yield and farm income, (ii) adaptation to heat and water stresses, and (iii) reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The analyses and conclusions are based on the literature and evidences from a large number of on-station as well as farmers’ field trials on CA in the cereal systems of IGP, India. Our analyses show that CA-based system substantially reduces the production cost (up to 23%) but produce equal or even higher than conventional system; thereby increasing economic profitability of production system. CA-based production systems also moderated the effect of high temperature (reduced canopy temperature by 1-4oC) and increased irrigation water productivity by 66-100% compared to traditional production systems thus well adapting to water and heat stress situations of IGP. Our continuous monitoring of soil flux of CO2, N2O and CH4 revealed that CA-based rice-wheat systems emit 10-15% less GHGs than conventional systems. This is the first time that CA and its components are synthesized and analyzed from food security-climate change nexus. From this holistic analysis, we suggest that wide-scale promotion of suitable CA practices by integrating into national agriculture development strategy is way forward to address food security, climate change adaptation and mitigation challenges faced by present agriculture.",,English,10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61093-0,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/4534,2015,Journal of Integrative Agriculture,Elsevier,1524-1533,zero tillage; crop residues; climate change; sustainability; conservation agriculture; residue retention
Exploring and mobilizing the Gene Bank Biodiversity for wheat improvement,"Sehgal, D.; Vikram, P.; Sansaloni, C.; Ortiz, C.; Saint Pierre, C.; Payne, T.S.; Ellis, M.H.; Amri, A.; Petroli, C.; Wenzl, P.; Singh, S.","Identifying and mobilizing useful genetic variation from germplasm banks to breeding programs is an important strategy for sustaining crop genetic improvement. The molecular diversity of 1,423 spring bread wheat accessions representing major global production environments was investigated using high quality genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) loci, and gene-based markers for various adaptive and quality traits. Mean diversity index (DI) estimates revealed synthetic hexaploids to be genetically more diverse (DI= 0.284) than elites (DI = 0.267) and landraces (DI = 0.245). GBS markers discovered thousands of new SNP variations in the landraces which were well known to be adapted to drought (1273 novel GBS SNPs) and heat (4473 novel GBS SNPs) stress environments. This may open new avenues for pre-breeding by enriching the elite germplasm with novel alleles for drought and heat tolerance. Furthermore, new allelic variation for vernalization and glutenin genes was also identified from 47 landraces originating from Iraq, Iran, India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The information generated in the study has been utilized to select 200 diverse gene bank accessions to harness their potential in pre-breeding and for allele mining of candidate genes for drought and heat stress tolerance, thus channeling novel variation into breeding pipelines.

"Farmers' climate change adaptation options and their determinants in Tigray Region, Northern Ethiopia","Hadgu, G.; Tesfaye, K.; Mamo, G.; Kassa, B.","Exploring micro-level evidences is critical to fine tune effective adaptation options to cope with the adverse impact of climate change. In this regard, detailed studies on climate change adaptation options are not available in the study areas. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess farmers’ climate change adaptation options and determinant factors that influence their choice. Data were collected from 253 respondents randomly using probability proportional to the sizes (PPS) of the population of each district and peasant association from which sample households to be drawn. Descriptive statistics were employed to assess adaptation options while the multinomial logit model (MNL) was used to identify factors influencing households’ choices. The results revealed that farmers use change in crop type /variety, soil and water conservation practices, crop diversification, change in planting date and irrigation practices as climate change adaptation options. Educational level of the household head, age of the household head, sex of the household head, farm income, access to extension service, access to credit, access to climate information and agro-ecological settings were the most important determinant factors that affect significantly the choice of farmers to climate change adaptations. Therefore, an effort that enhances farmers’ awareness to climate change and creates the capacity to adopt climate resilient options is an important strategy that should be considered by a variety of societal groups, including policy makers, and farmers support organizations.",,English,10.5897/AJAR2014.9146,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/4524,2015,African Journal of Agricultural Research,Academic Journals,956-964,climate change; mathematical models; farmers; adaptation options; determinants; multinomial logit model

Improving crop adaptation to climate change through strategic crossing of stress adaptive traits,"Reynolds, M.P.; Molero, G.; Tattaris, M.; Cossani, C.M.; Alderman, P.D.; Sukumaran, S.","Crossing programs based on phenomics have resulted in a new generation of drought adapted wheat lines based on strategic crossing of complementary physiological traits (PT) that have been included in CIMMYT's international distribution system since 2010. New PT lines have shown superior performance over conventional material in most international environments. For example, in the 17th SAWYT the average yield of PT lines was larger than the group of conventionally bred lines at 75% of international sites. This ongoing effort has involved broadening the genetic base of conventional wheat genepools through extensive use of genetic resources, including landraces and products of inter-specific hybridization with members of the Triticeae tribe. One of the prerequisites for successful application of phenomics in breeding is the establishment of reliable screening tools and platforms that can precisely measure expression of physiological traits in realistic field environments. Genetic gains associated with selection for canopy temperature and spectral water indices have shown that such remotely sensed traits can serve as proxies that reliably estimate water relations characteristics impacting on yield. The first aerial remote sensing platforms for large scale genetic resource screening was developed at CIMMYT in Mexico and more than half of the accessions of the World Wheat Collection have been screened. These high throughput field phenotyping tools have application in gene discovery and QTL for both drought and heat adaptive traits have been identified on 4 different chromosomes of the Seri/Babax RILs population, showing for the first time a common genetic basis for these key abiotic stresses. Similarly the phenology- controlled ‘Wheat Association Mapping Initiative’ panel has been used for gene discovery work. To define the best constellation of traits for application in breeding -and determine priorities for genetic understanding- it is necessary to develop conceptual models of adaptive traits that highlight wheat's genetic limitations under water limitation; pre-breeding serves as a practical tool to test different models.",,English,10.1016/j.proenv.2015.07.272,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/4499,2015,Procedia Environmental Sciences,Elsevier,298-299,physiology; breeding; phenotypes; remote sensing; phenomics
Modeling the effect of a heat wave on maize production in the USA and its implications on food security in the developing world,"Chung, U.; Gbegbelegbe, S.D.; Shiferaw, B.; Robertson, R.; Jin I. Yun; Tesfaye, K.; Hoogenboom, G.; Sonder, K.","This study uses geo-spatial crop modeling to quantify the biophysical impact of weather extremes. More specifically, the study analyzes the weather extreme which affected maize production in the USA in 2012; it also estimates the effect of a similar weather extreme in 2050, using future climate scenarios. The secondary impact of the weather extreme on food security in the developing world is also assessed using trend analysis. Many studies have reported on the significant reduction in maize production in the USA due to the extreme weather event (combined heat wave and drought) that occurred in 2012. However, most of these studies focused on yield and did not assess the potential effect of weather extremes on food prices and security. The overall goal of this study was to use geo-spatial crop modeling and trend analysis to quantify the impact of weather extremes on both yield and, followed food security in the developing world. We used historical weather data for severe extreme events that have occurred in the USA. The data were obtained from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In addition we used five climate scenarios: the baseline climate which is typical of the late 20th century (2000s) and four future climate scenarios which involve a combination of two emission scenarios (A1B and B1) and two global circulation models (CSIRO-Mk3.0 and MIROC 3.2). DSSAT 4.5 was combined with GRASS GIS for geo-spatial crop modeling. Simulated maize grain yield across all affected regions in the USA indicates that average grain yield across the USA Corn Belt would decrease by 29% when the weather extremes occur using the baseline climate. If the weather extreme were to occur under the A1B emission scenario in the 2050s respectively, average grain yields would decrease by 38% and 57%, under the CSIRO-Mk3.0 and MIROC 3.2 global climate models, respectively. The weather extremes that occurred in the USA in 2012 resulted in a sharp increase in the world maize price. In addition, it likely played a role in the reduction in world maize consumption and trade in 2012/13, compared to 2011/12. The most vulnerable countries to the weather extremes are poor countries with high maize import dependency ratios including those countries in the Caribbean, northern Africa and western Asia. Other vulnerable countries include low-income countries with low import dependency ratios but which cannot afford highly-priced maize. The study also highlighted the pathways through which a weather extreme would affect food security, were it to occur in 2050 under climate change. Some of the policies which could help vulnerable countries counter the negative effects of weather extremes consist of social protection and safety net programs. Medium- to long-term adaptation strategies include increasing world food reserves to a level where they can be used to cover the production losses brought by weather extremes.",,English,10.1016/j.wace.2014.07.002,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/4145,2014,Weather and Climate Extremes,Elsevier,67-77,spatial analysis; crop modelling; maize; food prices; food security
Crops that feed the world 10. Past successes and future challenges to the role played by wheat in global food security,"Shiferaw, B.; Smale, M.; Braun, H.J.; Duveiller, E.; Reynolds, M.P.; Muricho, G.","Wheat is fundamental to human civilization and has played an outstanding role in feeding a hungry world and improving global food security. The crop contributes about 20 % of the total dietary calories and proteins worldwide. Food demand in the developing regions is growing by 1 % annually and varies from 170 kg in Central Asia to 27 kg in East and South Africa. The developing regions (including China and Central Asia) account for roughly 53 % of the total harvested area and 50 % of the production. Unprecedented productivity growth from the Green Revolution (GR) since the 1960s dramatically transformed world wheat production, benefitting both producers and consumers through low production costs and low food prices. Modern wheat varieties were adopted more rapidly than any other technological innovation in the history of agriculture, recently reaching about 90 % of the area in developing regions. One of the key challenges today is to replace these varieties with new ones for better sustainability. While the GR ?spared? essential ecosystems from conversion to agriculture, it also generated its own environmental problems. Also productivity increase is now slow or static. Achieving the productivity gains needed to ensure food security will therefore require more than a repeat performance of the GR of the past. Future demand will need to be achieved through sustainable intensification that combines better crop resistance to diseases and pests, adaptation to warmer climates, and reduced use of water, fertilizer, labor and fuel. Meeting these challenges will require concerted efforts in research and innovation to develop and deploy viable solutions. Substantive investment will be required to realize sustainable productivity growth through better technologies and policy and institutional innovations that facilitate farmer adoption and adaptation. The enduring lessons from the GR and the recent efforts for sustainable intensification of cereal systems in South Asia and other regions provide useful insights for the future.",,English,10.1007/s12571-013-0263-y,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/3468,2013,Food Security,Springer Verlag,291-317,food security; demand; supply; uses; productivity; growth; climate change; wheat; utilization; technology adoption
Modeling the response of tropical highland herbaceous grassland species to climate change: The case of the Arsi Mountains of Ethiopia,"Aklilu Mekasha; Nigatu, L.; Tesfaye, K.; Duncan, A.J.","Global warming is forcing plant and animal species to respond either through pole-ward or upslope migration to adjust to temperature increases, and grassland communities are not an exception to this phenomenon. In this study, we modeled the response of herbaceous species of grasslands within the Arsi Mountains in Ethiopia under no-migration and with migration scenarios to the projected 4.2 °C increase of temperature by 2090 (under the A2 emission scenario). For 67 species of grasses and legumes, we determined the current and predicted altitudinal limits and calculated current and projected area coverage using a Digital Elevation Model. The results indicated that the projected warming significantly reduced altitudinal ranges and habitat areas of all the species studied. All the studied species faced range contraction and habitat loss with range shift gaps among forty two species under the no-migration scenario. With the migration scenario, however, the forty two species with range shift gaps are predicted to benefit from at least some habitat area retention. Between growth forms, legumes are predicted to lose significantly more habitat area than grasses under the no-migration scenario while no significant difference in habitat area loss is predicted under the migration scenario. It can be concluded that management options are required to facilitate upslope species migration to survive under the warming climate. This could involve leaving suitable dispersal corridors and assisted colonization depending on species behavior and level of extinction risk predicted under the projected warming.",,English,10.1016/j.biocon.2013.09.020,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/3353,2013,Biological Conservation,Elsevier,169-175,grasses; legumes; migration; climate change; altitudinal range; no-migration; warming
Beyond climate-smart agriculture: toward safe operating spaces for global food systems,"Neufeldt, H.; Jahn, M.; Campbell, B.M.; Beddington, J.R.; Declerck, F.; De Pinto, A.; Gulledge, J.; Hellin, J.; Herrero, M.; Jarvis, A.; LeZaks, D.; Meinke, H.; Rosenstock, T.; Scholes, M.; Scholes, R.; Vermeulen, S.; Wollenberg, E.; Zougmore, R.B.","Agriculture is considered to be ""climate-smart"" when it contributes to increasing food security, adaptation and mitigation in a sustainable way. This new concept now dominates current discussions in agricultural development because of its capacity to unite the agendas of the agriculture, development and climate change communities under one brand. In this opinion piece authored by scientists from a variety of international agricultural and climate research communities, we argue that the concept needs to be evaluated critically because the relationship between the three dimensions is poorly understood, such that practically any improved agricultural practice can be considered climate-smart. This lack of clarity may have contributed to the broad appeal of the concept. From the understanding that we must hold ourselves accountable to demonstrably better meet human needs in the short and long term within foreseeable local and planetary limits, we develop a conceptualization of climate-smart agriculture as agriculture that can be shown to bring us closer to safe operating spaces for agricultural and food systems across spatial and temporal scales. Improvements in the management of agricultural systems that bring us significantly closer to safe operating spaces will require transformations in governance and use of our natural resources, underpinned by enabling political, social and economic conditions beyond incremental changes. Establishing scientifically credible indicators and metrics of long-term safe operating spaces in the context of a changing climate and growing social-ecological challenges is critical to creating the societal demand and political will required to motivate deep transformations. Answering questions on how the needed transformational change can be achieved will require actively setting and testing hypotheses to refine and characterize our concepts of safer spaces for social-ecological systems across scales. This effort will demand prioritizing key areas of innovation, such as (1) improved adaptive management and governance of social-ecological systems; (2) development of meaningful and relevant integrated indicators of social-ecological systems; (3) gathering of quality integrated data, information, knowledge and analytical tools for improved models and scenarios in time frames and at scales relevant for decision-making; and (4) establishment of legitimate and empowered science policy dialogues on local to international scales to facilitate decision making informed by metrics and indicators of safe operating spaces.",,English,10.1186/2048-7010-2-12,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/3327,2013,Agriculture & Food Security,BioMed Central,,adaptation; climate-smart agriculture; development; food security; mitigation; safe space for humanity

We examined these aspects for conservation agriculture (CA) as part of a cropping system with nutrition- and climate-smart potential. The paper is based on a literature review and field experiences from Zambia and Mexico. Findings point up situations where the promotion of CA for smallholders in developing countries may have undesired effects from gender and human development perspectives, specifically relating to drudgery, nutrition and food security, residue use, assets, mechanization and extension. The direction and magnitude of potential trade-offs depend on the local context and the specific intervention.

"Identification of drought, heat, and combined drought and heat tolerant donors in maize","Cairns, J.E.; Crossa, J.; Zaidi, P.; Grudloyma, P.; Sanchez, C.; Araus, J.L.; Thaitad, S.; Makumbi, D.; Magorokosho, C.; Banziger, M.; Menkir, A.; Hearne, S.; Atlin, G.","Low maize (Zea maysL.) yields and the impacts of climate change on maize production highlight the need to improve yields in eastern and southern Africa. Climate projections suggest higher temperatures within drought-prone areas. Research in model species suggests that tolerance to combined drought and heat stress is genetically distinct from tolerance to either stress alone, but this has not been confirmed in maize. In this study we evaluated 300 maize inbred lines testcrossed to CML539. Experiments were conducted under optimal conditions, reproductive stage drought stress, heat stress, and combined drought and heat stress. Lines with high levels of tolerance to drought and combined drought and heat stress were identified. Significant genotype × trial interaction and very large plot residuals were observed; consequently, the repeatability of individual managed stress trials was low. Tolerance to combined drought and heat stress in maize was genetically distinct from tolerance to individual stresses, and tolerance to either stress alone did not confer tolerance to combined drought and heat stress. This finding has major implications for maize drought breeding. Many current drought donors and key inbreds used in widely grown African hybrids were susceptible to drought stress at elevated temperatures. Several donors tolerant to drought and combined drought and heat stress, notably La Posta Sequia C7-F64-2-6-2-2 and DTPYC9-F46-1-2-1-2, need to be incorporated into maize breeding pipelines.",,English,10.2135/cropsci2012.09.0545,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/3263,2013,Crop Science,Crop Science Society of America (CSSA),1335-1346,maize; drought tolerance; heat tolerance; climate change; gene interaction
Adapting maize production to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa,"Cairns, J.E.; Hellin, J.; Sonder, K.; Araus, J.L.; MacRobert, J.; Thierfelder, C.; Prasanna, B.M.","Given the accumulating evidence of climate change in sub-Saharan Africa, there is an urgent need to develop more climate resilient maize systems. Adaptation strategies to climate change in maize systems in sub-Saharan Africa are likely to include improved germplasm with tolerance to drought and heat stress and improved management practices. Adapting maize systems to future climates requires the ability to accurately predict future climate scenarios in order to determine agricultural responses to climate change and set priorities for adaptation strategies. Here we review the projected climate change scenarios for Africa?s maize growing regions using the outputs of 19 global climate models. By 2050, air temperatures are expected to increase throughout maize mega- environments within sub-Saharan Africa by an average of 2.1°C. Rainfall changes during the maize growing season varied with location. Given the time lag between the development of improved cultivars until the seed is in the hands of farmers and adoption of new management practices, there is an urgent need to prioritise research strategies on climate change resilient germplasm development to offset the predicted yield declines.",,English,10.1007/s12571-013-0256-x,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/3257,2013,Food Security,Springer Verlag,345-360,maize; climate change; heat stress; drought stress; germplasm; conservation agriculture; seeds; germplasm improvement; seed delivery systems
Outlook of future climate in northwestern Ethiopia,"Dereje Ayalew; Tesfaye, K.; Girma Mamo; Birru Yitaferu; Wondimu Bayu","Climate change is described as the most universal and irreversible environmental problem facing the planet Earth. While climate change is already manifesting in Ethiopia through changes in temperature and rainfall, its magnitude is poorly studied at regional levels. The objective of this paper was to assess and quantify the magnitude of future changes of climate parameters using Statistical Downscaling Mode (SDSM) version 4.2 in Amhara Regional State which is located between 8°45‘N and 13°45‘N latitude and 35°46‘E and 40°25‘E longitude. Daily climate data (1979- 2008) of rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures were collected from 10 observed meteorological stations (predictand). The stations were grouped and compared using clustering and Markov chain model, whereas the degree of climate change in the study area was estimated using the coupled HadCM3 general circulation model (GCM) with A2a emission scenarios (Predictors). Both maximum and minimum temperatures showed an increasing trend; the increase in mean maximum temperature ranges between 1.55°C and 6.07°C and that of the mean minimum temperature ranges from 0.11°C and 2.81°C. While the amount of annual rainfall and rainy days decreased in the study Regions in the 2080s. The negative changes in rainfall and temperature obtained from the HadCM3 model in the current study are alarming and suggest the need for further study with several GCM models to confirm the current results and develop adaptation options.",,English,10.4236/as.2012.34074,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/2258,2012,Agricultural Sciences,Scientific Research Publishing,608-624,climate change; computer applications; data analysis; mathematical models; hadcm3; statistical downscaling
Bridging the phenotypic and genetic data useful for integrated breeding through a data annotation using the Crop Ontology developed by the crop communities of practice,"Shrestha, R.; Matteis, L.; Skofic, M.; Portugal, A.; McLaren, G.; Hyman, G.; Arnaud, E.","The Crop Ontology (CO) of the Generation Challenge Program (GCP) (http://cropontology.org/) is developed for the Integrated Breeding Platform (IBP) (https://www.integratedbreeding.net/) by several centers of The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR): bioversity, CIMMYT, CIP, ICRISAT, IITA, and IRRI. Integrated breeding necessitates that breeders access genotypic and phenotypic data related to a given trait. The CO provides validated trait names used by the crop communities of practice (CoP) for harmonizing the annotation of phenotypic and genotypic data and thus supporting data accessibility and discovery through web queries. The trait information is completed by the description of the measurement methods and scales, and images. The trait dictionaries used to produce the Integrated Breeding (IB) fieldbooks are synchronized with the CO terms for an automatic annotation of the phenotypic data measured in the field. The IB fieldbook provides breeders with direct access to the CO to get additional descriptive information on the traits. Ontologies and trait dictionaries are online for cassava, chickpea, common bean, groundnut, maize, Musa, potato, rice, sorghum, and wheat. Online curation and annotation tools facilitate (http://cropontology.org) direct maintenance of the trait information and production of trait dictionaries by the crop communities. An important feature is the cross referencing of CO terms with the Crop database trait ID and with their synonyms in Plant Ontology (PO) and Trait Ontology (TO). Web links between cross referenced terms in CO provide online access to data annotated with similar ontological terms, particularly the genetic data in Gramene (University of Cornell) or the evaluation and climatic data in the Global Repository of evaluation trials of the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security programme (CCAFS). Cross-referencing and annotation will be further applied in the IBP.",,English,10.3389/fphys.2012.00326,https://hdl.handle.net/10883/1915,2012,Frontiers in Physiology,Frontiers,1-14,ontology; breeding; phenotypes; data analysis; integrated plant production; crop ontology; trait dictionaries; breeding fieldbook; data annotation; integrated breeding platform
