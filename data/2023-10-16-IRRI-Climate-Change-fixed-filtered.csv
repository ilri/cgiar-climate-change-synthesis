Potential and versatility of WEAP software (Water Evaluation and Planning System) for impact assessments of Alternate Wetting and Drying in irrigated rice,,0378-3774,"Schneider, Pia","Asch, Folkard;Sander, Bjoern Ole;Wassmann, Reiner",Elsevier BV,Agricultural Water Management,2019,(e-first copy): 13 pages,"The production of irrigated rice is increasingly challenged by freshwater scarcity. Water saving technologies such as Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) allow sustaining production levels under reduced water availability. Before implementing such innovations on a large scale, their hydrological impact on the system needs to be assessed.  This study investigated the applicability of the water management tool WEAP (Water Evaluation and Planning System) for evaluating the effects of AWD on water use and water resources at field and irrigation system level for two different case studies in Central Luzon, the Philippines.  In the first study, the Zeigler Experiment Station (ZES) of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was used for parameterization of WEAP and field-scale assessment of AWD, making use of the availability of spatially and temporally highly resolved data. In the second study, WEAP was applied to an irrigation scheme in the Philippines, the Angat-Maasim River Irrigation System (AMRIS) to assess effects on up- and downstream water resources using lower resolution data.  Simulated AWD implementation during the dry season reduced water requirements by 12–27% and 34.3% on ZES and AMRIS, respectively. Additionally, AWD implementation enhanced streamflow in main and lateral canals, and thus increased water availability in the entire irrigation system. We also conducted an ex-ante assessment of future freshwater availability assuming reduced precipitation due to climate change effects alongside with irrigation supply at current levels. WEAP showed that water levels in the reservoir will substantially decline under these circumstances leading to severe water stress in AMRIS. Implementing AWD in such a scenario improved water availability in the system by up to 50%. WEAP proved to be a suitable tool for upscaling different irrigation techniques and assessing their impact on water resources on a large scale. Limitations of the approach and future possibilities for improvements are discussed.",English,Agronomy and Crop Science;Earth-Surface Processes;Soil Science;Water Science and Technology,Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.03.030,https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByGk26Nk_MlAQVp3U1hyTHdjVkVvS0NZRkJaUjA5OVRzMzlj/view,JA

Climate change, urbanisation and land degradation are putting further pressure on the food supply. The multifaceted and self-reinforcing nature of these challenges calls for a fundamental transformation of the food system. In the past, crop improvement through breeding has been the major tool to lift people out of poverty and increase global food supply. To adequately address these food security challenges, new improved crop varieties need to be developed and reach farmers sooner as a partial solution. In this review, we focus on various proven conventional and biotechnological accelerating plant breeding methods that do not require genetic engineering or gene editing. We pay specific attention to the feasibility for implementation by national agricultural research systems in developing countries in the short term. We argue that postponing technologies that can accelerate breeding makes no economic sense and warrant immediate adoption of accelerated breeding practices in the public sector. Considering a wide range of factors including the economics of accelerated breeding, we advocate the use of a method called rapid generation advance (RGA) as the most feasible method for accelerating breeding in the public sector.",English,Agronomy and Crop Science;General Medicine;Genetics;Plant Science,Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2019.110207,https://drive.google.com/a/irri.org/file/d/1RcnDaf0T8JdZMCgx8Q1QrQzvfTgi_zKc/view?usp=drive_open,JA

This study evaluated management options that could improve productivity and reduce risks of rice crop in stress-prone areas of the country. We selected four sites from two regions in the central dry zone (Wundwin) and the Ayeyarwady delta (Labutta, Bogale and Mawlamyinegyun). We used experimental and survey datasets on farmers’ practices and rice yields from 2012 to 2014 to run the ORYZA model to simulate the climatic yield potential (YP; yield without stress) and the attainable yield under rainfed conditions (YW; yield limited by water), saline conditions (YS; yield limited by salinity), and under conditions of current farmers’ practices (YF; yield in farmers’ practices). Simulated yield responses to different management practices showed spatial variability within and among the selected sites. YP ranged from 5.4 to 11.1 t ha−1, YW ranged from 0.5 to 7.5 t ha−1, and YF ranged from 2.2 to 4.2 t ha−1. In salt-affected areas, average YS ranged from less than 0.1 t ha-1 to 5.6 t ha−1. Yield gains with the choice of an improved variety and adjusted sowing date were estimated at up to 53% above YF. Changing the time of sowing and using improved rice varieties provided the greatest yield gains in salt-affected and drought-prone areas where YF was the least. In areas where YF was greater, the improvement of nitrogen management provided larger benefits than in areas with lower YF.

The increasing variability in the local climate due to global climate changes and the increasing severity of the ENSO phenomenon threatens rice production in the region, which has consequences for local and global food security. Though existing mapping efforts delineate the consequences of saline water intrusion during El Niño and flooding events during La Niña in the basin, research to predict future impacts in rice production is rather limited. The current work uses ORYZA, an ecophysiological model, combined with historical climate data, climate change scenarios RCP4.5 and 8.5 and climate-related risk maps to project the aggregate productivity and rice production impacts by the year 2050. Results show that in years of average salinity intrusion and flooding, the winter-spring rice crop in the MRD would experience an average annual decrease of 720,450 tons for 2020–2050 under the RCP4.5 scenario compared to the baseline of 2005–2016 average and another 1.17 million tons under the RCP8.5 scenario. The autumn-winter crop would decrease by 331,480 tons under RCP4.5 and 462,720 tons under RCP8.5. In years of severe salinity intrusion and flooding, the winter-spring rice crop would decrease by 2.13 million tons (10.29% lower than the projection for an average year) under RCP4.5 and 2.5 million tons (13.62%) under RCP8.5. Under severe conditions, the autumn-winter crop would have an average decrease of 1.3 million tons (7.36%) under RCP4.5 and 1.4 million tons (10.88%) for the RCP8.5 scenario. Given that most of the rice produced in this area is exported, a decline in rice supply at this scale would likely have implications on the global market price of rice affecting global food security. Such decline will also have implications for the rural economy and food security of Vietnam.

We conducted field experiments in five consecutive growing seasons at the International Rice Research Institute, Philippines. We selected genotypes in the first two seasons, then performed detailed characterization of the most promising genotypes in the following three seasons. Of the 50 advanced‐generation genotypes, three had consistently high yield and early maturity, with yields 11% to 38% higher than that of IRRI104 (IR50404‐57‐2‐2‐3), a short‐duration variety that is most widely grown in Southeast Asia. These genotypes were 20 to 32 cm taller than IRRI104. We found that low source capacity, defined as stem nonstructural carbohydrates at heading plus biomass accumulation after heading, for grain growth was the major factor for low yield of IRRI104. Although sink capacity (spikelets m−2 × grain weight) in the promising genotypes were comparable to that of IRRI104, they had 25% to 53% higher source‐to‐sink ratio (source capacity / sink capacity) than IRRI104, which was attributed to larger leaf area and greater biomass accumulation during the grain‐filling stage.

Metabolite composition was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). HNT effects were more pronounced in panicles than in flag leaves. A decreased abundance of sugar phosphates and sucrose, and a higher abundance of monosaccharides in panicles indicated impaired glycolysis and higher respiration-driven carbon losses in response to HNT in the WS.

The adoption of stress-tolerant rice varieties (STRVs) is recommended as a best technology fix for risk adaptation. Although STRVs provide better outcomes with no yield penalty, farmers' decisions to adopt new STRVs are influenced by a multitude of factors, most importantly information exposure. We used a sequential logit model to analyze the impact of information access and information quality on adoption decisions regarding STRVs in flood-risk areas.

Potential of alternate wetting and drying irrigation practices for the mitigation of GHG emissions from rice fields: Two cases in central Luzon (Philippines),,2077-0472,"Sander, Björn Ole","Asis, Constancio A.;Romasanta, Ryan;Samoy-Pascual, Kristine;Schneider, Pia;Sibayan, Evangeline B.;Wassmann, Reiner",MDPI AG,Agriculture,2020,"Volume 10, no. 8350; pages 1-19.","Reducing methane (CH4) emission from paddy rice production is an important target for many Asian countries in order to comply with their climate policy commitments. National greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory approaches like the Tier-2 approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are useful to assess country-scale emissions from the agricultural sector. In paddy rice, alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is a promising and well-studied water management technique which, as shown in experimental studies, can effectively reduce CH4 emissions. However, so far little is known about GHG emission rates under AWD when the technique is fully controlled by farmers. This study assesses CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes under continuous flooded (CF) and AWD treatments for seven subsequent seasons on farmers’ fields in a pumped irrigation system in Central Luzon, Philippines. Under AWD management, CH4 emissions were substantially reduced (73% in dry season (DS), 21% in wet season (WS)). In all treatments, CH4 is the major contributor to the total GHG emission and is, thus, identified as the driving force to the global warming potential (GWP). The contribution of N2O emissions to the GWP was higher in CF than in AWD, however, these only offset 15% of the decrease in CH4 emission and, therefore, did not jeopardize the strong reduction in the GWP. The study proves the feasibility of AWD under farmers’ management as well as the intended mitigation effect. Resulting from this study, it is recommended to incentivize dissemination strategies in order to improve the effectiveness of mitigation initiatives. A comparison of single CH4 emissions to calculated emissions with the IPCC Tier-2 inventory approach identified that, although averaged values showed a sufficient degree of accuracy, fluctuations for single measurement points have high variation which limit the use of the method for field-level assessments.",English,,Crossref,https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10080350,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BASRqSiEoKN5Ff5oPyH73sxMndMz6VIq/view,JA

The incidence, intensity and duration of these stresses are anticipated to aggravate due to climate change consequences, demanding resilient yields in these situations to be essential. Present paper deals with reviewing various types of abiotic stresses and their mitigation strategies for enhancing and stabilizing rice production in stress prone areas. Review of available literature pertaining to the study area has been used as research methodology for this paper. The available literature suggests that stress-tolerant varieties can serve as the most viable strategy to contribute in coping with the problem of abiotic stresses. Although, good progress has been made in the development of stress-tolerant rice varieties (STRVs) and incessant efforts are being made to spread these varieties in target areas, adoption by farmers is yet to meet expectations. Advantage, affordability, awareness and availability are the main factors responsible for adopting of any technology. The adoption of stress-tolerant varieties has not reached its potential, predominantly due to the lack of awareness and non-availability of seeds amongst farmers. Strategic and intentional collaborations should be ensured for scaling the sustainable delivery and diffusion of STRVs. A promotional roadmap that ensures the linkages between private and public seed sectors remains the key factor for its successful adoption. Similarly, strengthening of formal, informal and semi-formal seed systems is crucial to accelerate the dissemination of these varieties. There is an imperative need to create strategic plans for the development of varieties possessing multiple stress tolerance. Significant investments for sustainability of rice production in stress prone areas form the essential component of long-term agricultural development.

The objective of this study was to conduct an integrated assessment of variables related to socioeconomic status, farm characteristics, and crop management practices to understand the major factors influencing crop productivity and identify promising leverage points for sustainable development in coastal Bangladesh. Using a panel survey dataset of 32 variables from 502 farm households located within polder (coastal embankment) and outside polder systems during 2005–2015, we employed statistical factor analysis to characterize five independent latent factors named here as Farming Challenges, Economic Status, Crop Management Practices, Asset Endowment, and Farm Characteristics. The factor Farming Challenges explained the most variation among households (31%), with decreases observed over time, specifically households located outside polders. Individual variables contributing to this factor included perceived cyclone severity, household distance to main roads and input-output markets, cropping intensity, and access to extension services. The most important factors for increasing crop productivity on a household and per unit area basis were Asset Endowment and Crop Management Practices, respectively. The former highlights the need for increasing gross cropped area, which can be achieved through greater cropping intensity, while the latter was associated with increased fertilizer, labor, and pesticide input use. Despite the importance of these factors, household poverty trajectory maps showed that changes in off-farm income had played the strongest role in improving livelihoods in this coastal area.

Harun; Juraimi, Abdul Shukor; Ahmed, Sharif; Shrestha, Anil",MDPI AG,Agronomy,2021,Volume 11 no. 10 p. 1921,"Crop production is a constant battle with weeds, in which weeds, generally, are victorious. Therefore, rather than channeling our efforts into the development of a “silver bullet” to control weeds, the focus should be on sustainable weed management in both natural- and agro-ecosystems. However, sustainable weed management can be a challenge in the context of global climate change. Over the past few decades, global climate change, mostly indicated by phenomena such as increased atmospheric temperature and elevated CO2 levels, is evident due to human activities and natural events. These phenomena also affect regional/local climate, resulting in significant influences on the agricultural systems of a particular region. Rising CO2 levels may give comparative advantages to C3 plants through increased photosynthesis, biomass production and yield, compared to C4 plants. Plants with C4 photosynthetic pathways, on the other hand, are likely to benefit more from rising global temperatures than C3 plants. Thus, the differential responses of C3 and C4 plants to climate change may alter crop–weed interactions and competition outcomes, most likely at the expense of the crop. Climate change will likely cause shifts in weed community compositions, their population dynamics, life cycle, phenology, and infestation pressure. Some weed species may go extinct, while some others may become more aggressive invaders. Weeds are, generally, colonizers and have some unique biological traits and ecological amplitudes that enable them to successfully dominate crops in a habitat with changed environmental conditions. Moreover, climate shifts, especially erratic rainfall and drought, may affect herbicide selectivity and efficacy or the success of bio-control agents resulting in an establishment of a mixed and complex population of C3 and C4 weed species adding to the complexity of weed management. Although elevated CO2 levels will stimulate the productivity of major C3 crops, most troublesome agricultural weeds will likely be more responsive to a rise in CO2 than crops, and thus may dominate the agro-ecosystem. It is predicted that, as temperature rises, the majority of the C4 weeds will flourish and will pose serious crop yield losses. Understanding and assessment of the impact of simultaneous changes in multiple climate factors and their complex interactions on crops and weeds are therefore necessary to formulate an adaptive weed management approach and build resilience. Moreover, strategic policies and strong actions need to be taken to reduce the root causes of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions to minimize the impact of climate change on weed biology and managementOpen access;",English,Agronomy and Crop Science,Crossref;Crossref,https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11101921,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i3ZXvoBbQtakDxcpm06whSIJYH5Jcphb/view,JA

These activities were shown to deplete soil organic matter stocks, resulting in a decrease in microbial activity and soil organic carbon (SOC) content. Moreover, even with minimal use of organic sources in cultivated land, soil carbon status deteriorated, particularly in subtropical climates. Integrated nutrient management (INM), a modified farming method, has the potential to effectively utilize organic and inorganic resources, to improve the quality of soils and crops, and making farming more economically viable and sustainable. The aim of this study was to use meta-analysis to quantify the effects of INM on crop production, soil carbon, and microbial activity in Indian soils. During the years 1989–2018, data from various research studies in India, mainly on nutrient management in rice and wheat crops, were collected. Meta-Win 2.1 software was used to analyze the results, and significance was determined at p &amp;lt; 0.05. The results showed that the yield of rice and wheat was 1.4 and 4.9% more in INM than that in 100% NPK (N: nitrogen, P: phosphorous, and K: potassium), and that respective yields were comparatively higher in loamy soils (2.8%) and clayey soils (1.0%). The INM treatment increased SOC and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), resulting in improved overall soil quality. The SOC stock was increased by 23.8% in rice, 15.1% in wheat, 25.3% in loamy soils, and 14.4% in clayey soils in INM over 100% NPK. Microbial quotient (MQ) data showed significant trends between different management systems in both soil types, for example, INM &amp;gt; 100% NPK &amp;gt; No NPK. Due to more soil cracking and reduced aggregate stability in the rice field (greater short-term soil structural changes), the SOC stock loss in rice was higher than that in wheat. The CO2 equivalent emissions were 7.9 Mg ha−1 higher in no NPK (control) than in 100% NPK, and 16.4 Mg ha−1 higher in control than in INM. In other words, INM increased soil carbon sequestration by 2.3 Mg ha−1 as compared to using 100% NPK.

Part of the problem is that research and practice in CGIAR and among its national breeding program partners tend to treat the private sector as a vehicle for seed delivery, rather than as commercial businesses facing a range of unique constraints and threats. This paper adopts a value chain framework to examine these relationships and pathways for improved varietal adoption/turnover outcomes in three cases: hybrid maize, farmed fish, and rice. In the first two cases, weak incentives and high risks left seed companies reluctant to invest in the marketing and quality assurance efforts needed to realize near-term impacts at scale from breeding investments. In the third case, seed companies played an insignificant role: grain traders supplied certified seed to smallholders, potentially prioritizing consumers’ quality preferences over climate-resilience and stress-tolerance traits for farmers. The findings raise important questions about the role of CGIAR and national breeding programs; specifically, how these programs can effectively support the private sector to deliver impact at greater scale, how consumer preferences are captured in trait prioritization within breeding programs, and what types of incentive mechanisms can be changed within breeding programs to advance a genuine shift towards ‘demand-oriented’ plant breeding.",English,Agronomy and Crop Science; Animal Science and Zoology; Ecology,Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref,https://doi.org/10.1177/00307270211059551,,JA

Alterations in internal leaf morphology and cellular architecture are needed to underpin some of these improvements. One of the targets is to generate a “Kranz-like” anatomy in leaves that includes decreased interveinal spacing close to that in C4 plant species. As C4 photosynthesis has evolved from C3 photosynthesis independently in multiple lineages, the genes required to facilitate C4 may already be present in the rice genome. The Taiwan Rice Insertional Mutants (TRIM) population offers the advantage of gain-of-function phenotype trapping, which accelerates the identification of rice gene function. In the present study, we screened the TRIM population to determine the extent to which genetic plasticity can alter vein density (VD) in rice. Close vein spacing mutant 1 (CVS1), identified from a VD screening of approximately 17,000 TRIM lines, conferred heritable high leaf VD. Increased vein number in CVS1 was confirmed to be associated with activated expression of two nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins. Overexpression of the two NB-LRR genes individually in rice recapitulates the high VD phenotype, due mainly to reduced interveinal mesophyll cell (M cell) number, length, bulliform cell size and thus interveinal distance. Our studies demonstrate that the trait of high VD in rice can be achieved by elevated expression of NB-LRR proteins limited to no yield penaltyOpen access;",English,Plant Science; Agronomy and Crop Science; General Medicine,Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00299-021-02810-5,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z3i7ZUycbFBiH4u9qQp9MKILViLp03jf/view,JA

To better control the disease, it is important to understand its epidemiology and how key aspects of this (e.g. infection efficiency, and spatial spread) change according to environment (e.g. local site conditions and season), management, and in particular, variety resistance. To explore this, we analysed data on the disease progress on resistant and susceptible varieties of rice grown at four sites in the Philippines across five seasons using a combination of mechanistic modelling and statistical analysis. Disease incidence was generally lower in the resistant variety. However, we found no evidence that the primary infection efficiency was lower in resistant varieties, suggesting that differences were largely due to reduced secondary spread. Despite secondary spread being attributed to splash dispersal which is exacerbated by wind and rain, the wetter sites of Pila and Victoria in south Luzon tended to have lower infection rates than the drier sites in central Luzon. Likewise, we found spread in the dry season can be substantial and should therefore not be ignored. In fact, we found site to be a greater determinant of the number of infection attempts suggesting that other environmental and management factors had greater effect on the disease than climate. Primary infection was characterised by spatially-random observations of disease incidence.

In this effort, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) continues to play a critical role in creating and disseminating rice varieties with higher productivity. Due to increasing demand for rice, especially in Africa, there is a strong need to accelerate the rate of genetic improvement for grain yield. In an effort to identify and characterize the elite breeding pool of IRRI’s irrigated rice breeding program, we analyzed 102 historical yield trials conducted in the Philippines during the period 2012–2016 and representing 15,286 breeding lines (including released varieties). A mixed model approach based on the pedigree relationship matrix was used to estimate breeding values for grain yield, which ranged from 2.12 to 6.27 t·ha−1. The rate of genetic gain for grain yield was estimated at 8.75 kg·ha−1 year−1 (0.23%) for crosses made in the period from 1964 to 2014. Reducing the data to only IRRI released varieties, the rate doubled to 17.36 kg·ha−1 year−1 (0.46%). Regressed against breeding cycle the rate of gain for grain yield was 185 kg·ha−1 cycle−1 (4.95%). We selected 72 top performing lines based on breeding values for grain yield to create an elite core panel (ECP) representing the genetic diversity in the breeding program with the highest heritable yield values from which new products can be derived. The ECP closely aligns with the indica 1B sub-group of Oryza sativa that includes most modern varieties for irrigated systems. Agronomic performance of the ECP under multiple environments in Asia and Africa confirmed its high yield potential. We found that the rate of genetic gain for grain yield found in this study was limited primarily by long cycle times and the direct introduction of non-improved material into the elite pool. Consequently, the current breeding scheme for irrigated rice at IRRI is based on rapid recurrent selection among highly elite lines. In this context, the ECP constitutes an important resource for IRRI and NAREs breeders to carefully characterize and manage that elite diversity.",English,Plant Science; Soil Science; Agronomy and Crop Science,Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12284-021-00533-5,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PtXrj7HRw0c2SAwJYJlQpHqEmK4TFrq6/view,JA

We used regression-based approaches to examine the factors influencing farmers’ adoption of AWD and its impact on yield. Results showed that the majority of the AWD adopters were farmers who practiced enforced rotational irrigation (RI) scheduling within their irrigators’ association (IA). With the current irrigation management system, the probability of AWD implementation increases when farmers do not interfere with the irrigation schedule (otherwise they opt to go with flooding). Interestingly, the awareness factor did not play a significant role in the farmers’ adoption due to the RI setup. However, the perception of water management as an effective weed control method was positively significant, suggesting that farmers are likely to adopt AWD if weeds are not a major issue in their field. Furthermore, the impact on grain yields did not differ with AWD.

The MMM simulations captured the spatial patterns and annual cycles of rainfall and surface air temperatures. However, bias was observed in the precipitation amounts and daily rainfall intensity. The trends in the simulations of MMM for both precipitation and temperatures were less satisfactory than the observed climate means. The Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-sorghum model was used to estimate the potential impacts of future climate change on post-rainy season sorghum yield values.

Most of the low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America are not fully prepared in terms of surveillance, diagnostics, and deployment of plant health solutions due to several factors: adequate investment is lacking; knowledge is inadequate; and connections from the local to global, and global to local are insufficient. Effectively countering the current and emerging threats to plant health requires a holistic approach that includes: 1) globally coordinated diagnostic and surveillance systems; 2) epidemiological modelling, risk assessment, forecasting and preparedness for proactive management and containment; and 3) implementation of context-sensitive, eco-friendly, gender-responsive and socially inclusive integrated disease and pest management approaches to reduce the impacts of devastating transboundary pests and diseases. Despite several success stories where major pests and diseases have been brought to control through integrated approaches, further multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary efforts are necessary. Plant health management requires stronger interface between the biophysical and social sciences, and empowerment of local communities.

To ascertain the role of female reproductive organ (pistil), two rice genotypes N22 and IR64 with contrasting heat stress responses were exposed to control (30 °C) and heat stress (38 °C and 40 °C) during megasporogenesis. Anatomical observations of ovule revealed greater disappearance of megaspore mother cell and nuclei at early stages, and during later stages mature embryo sac without female germ unit, improper positioning of nuclei, and shrunken embryo sac was observed in the sensitive IR64. Under heat stress, a decrease in sugar and starch, increase in H2O2 and malondialdehyde with lower antioxidant enzyme activities were recorded in pistils of both N22 and IR64. Lower accumulation of TCA cycle metabolites and amino acids were noticed in IR64 pistils under heat stress at gametogenesis, whereas N22 exhibited favorable metabolite profiles. At heading, however, N22 pistils had higher carbohydrate accumulation and better ROS homeostasis, suggesting higher recovery after heat stress exposure. In summary, the results indicate that heat stress during megasporogenesis leads to irreversible anatomical and physiological changes in pistil and alters metabolic signatures leading to increased spikelet sterility in rice.

CA has been advocated extensively to optimize the use of available resources, maintain the environmental quality, enhance crop productivity, and reduce the climate change impacts. Information related to the impacts of long-term CA-production systems under rice-based cropping systems on pest status is lacking, particularly in middle Indo-Gangetic Plains (MIGP). Under CA, puddling is completely avoided, and rice is directly sown or transplanted to maintain better soil health. Different sets of experimentations including farmers practice, partial CA and full CA (CA) as treatments in rice-based cropping systems, were established from 2009, 2015 and 2016 to understand the long-term impacts of CA on pest dynamics. In this study, direct and indirect effects of tillage (zero, reduced and conventional tillage), residue retention and cropping sequences on abundance and damage by pests were investigated. After 4–5 years of experimentation, populations of oriental armyworm [Mythinma (Leucania) (Pseudaletia) separata (Wlk.)] in wheat, mealybug [Brevennia rehi (Lindinger)] and bandicoot rat [Bandicota bengalensis (Gray)] in rice were found to increase abnormally in CA-based production systems. Conventionally tilled plots had a significant negative effect while residue load in zero-tilled plots had a significant positive effect on larval population build-up of M. separata. Zero tillage had a higher infestation of mealybug (52–91% infested hills) that used grassy weeds (Echinochloa colona, Echinochloa crusgalli, Cynodon dactylon, Leptochloa chinensis and Panicum repense) as alternate hosts.

Data analytics are essential for achieving this goal, especially the so-called science of enviromics (large-scale environmental characterization of crop growing conditions) that could be used to pinpoint the relevant environment impacts driving the adaptation of a certain specie in a breeding framework. Here we quantified the effects of diverse climate factors on the current adaptation of elite common bean germplasm in Brazil. To capture the non-linearity of those impacts across a wide range of environments, we developed an ""enviromic prediction"" approach by combining Generalized Additive Models (GAM), environmental covariates (EC), and grain yield (GY) from 18 years of historical breeding trials. Then, we predicted the optimum limits for ECs at each production scenario (four regions, three seasons, and two grain types) and its respective predictions of GY adaptation. Our results indicate that the nonlinear influence of air temperature, solar radiation, and rainfall led to a huge interaction of the impacts among the development stages, seasons, and regions. This revealed that seasonality differently affected the vegetative and reproductive stages, which its impact drastically vary according to the region and season, which makes unfeasible the development of a breeding strategy for selecting for broad adaptation. Conversely, with our approach it was possible to pinpoint the effects of the region- or season-specific impacts, which helped identify the ""climate limits"" and critical development phases for each possible production scenario. This could allow breeders to design crop ideotypes while directing efforts to develop climate-smart varieties.

Despite distinct climatic conditions, all these CSVs have rice-based landscapes as a common denominator. This article focuses on the improvement of rice seed systems as the core of introducing climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in these villages. The experience of a CSV in Lao PDR clearly shows community-based seed (CBS) systems as a viable CSV component. Moreover, the efficiency of CBS systems is enhanced when applied in combination with the following supporting climate-smart interventions: (1) training in improved crop and pest management through farmers’ field schools, (2) awareness raising through photo exhibits and seed fairs, (3) participatory variety selection, and (4) climate risk mapping as a means for targeted distribution of improved rice varieties.

In Bangladesh, minor cereals have been cultivated on a small-scale for a long time, but limited information is available on their growth, yield, and the possibility of expanding the cultivated area. This study evaluated the status and potential of minor cereals using secondary data, GIS mapping, and structured survey questionnaires. Currently, minor cereals are grown on around 4813 ha of land. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) alone accounts for 63.0% of the area cultivated, followed by proso millet (Panicum miliaceum) 28.2%, barley (Hordeum vulgare) 7.5%, pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) 0.6%, and oats (Avena sativa) 0.6%.

Their genes are transferable to cultivated rice through crossing and they have been contributing significantly to rice variety improvement by introgression of their diverse valuable traits, especially biotic stress resistance. Moreover, active use of wild rice resources might be one of the ideal solutions to seek novel or superior alleles/genes to cope with climate change and stable high-yield rice production. DNA markers are essential tools for genetic analysis and breeding. However, to date, there are no suitable DNA marker sets for BB-genome species (O. punctata). In this study, we developed a genome genome-wide InDel marker set evenly distributed (∼2 Mb intervals) across the 12 chromosomes for BB-genome species. The markers were validated by PCR-agarose gel analysis with BB-genome containing species: four accessions each of O. punctata (BB) and O. minuta (BBCC). Out of the 191 InDel markers designed, 184 (96.3%) and 138 (72.2%) were able to differentiate the alleles between O. sativa and O. punctata and between O. sativa and O. minuta respectively. The same marker sets were also tested in other genome types species (CC, CCDD, EE, FF, GG, HHJJ, and KKLL) and one accession of Leersia perrieri (a sister genus to Oryza). The number of polymorphic markers (O. sativa vs other genome types) was drastically reduced in other genome types. In contrast, the number of markers showing no PCR amplification increased, especially in FF, GG, HHJJ, and KKLL species.

It contributes ∼20% of calories to the human diet (Stein et al., 2018). With the increase in global population and rapid changes in climate, rice breeders need to develop new and sustainable cultivars with higher yields, healthier grains, and reduced environmental footprints (Wing et al., 2018). Since the first gold-standard reference genome of rice variety Nipponbare was published (International Rice Genome Sequencing Project, 2005), an increasing number of rice accessions have been sequenced, assembled, and annotated with global efforts. Nowadays, a single reference genome is obviously insufficient to perform the genetic difference analysis for rice accessions. Therefore, the pan-genome has been proposed as a solution, which allows the discovery of more presence-absence variants compared with single-reference genome-based studies (Zhao et al., 2018). Over the past years, several databases, such as RAP-db (https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp), RGAP (http://rice.uga.edu), and Gramene (https://www.gramene.org), have long-term served rice genomic research by providing information based on one or a series of individual reference genomes.

After two weeks of drought stress, several physiological and growth performance traits significantly varied between the SBIRs (p ≤ 0.05) and were less affected in the SBIRs and the donor (SB and IR554190-04) than SB. The total drought response indices (TDRI) identified three superior lines (SBIR-153-146-13, SBIR-127-105-12, SBIR-62-79-8) and three on par with the donor and drought-tolerant check (SBIR-17-21-3, SBIR-31-43-4, SBIR-103-98-10) in adapting to drought conditions.

The MIKE NAM and MIKE HYDRO BASIN models were used for rainfall–runoff (R-R) and water balance modeling, respectively, and the Keetch–Byram Drought Index (KBDI) was used to estimate the magnitude of the droughts. The results identified areas within the Nga-Luy River basin where abnormally dry and moderate drought conditions are common, as well as subbasins, i.e., in the southeast and northeast, where severe and extreme droughts often prevail. It was also shown that the water demand for the irrigation of the winter–spring and summer–autumn crop life cycles could be fully met under abnormally dry conditions. This possibility decreases to 85–100% during moderate droughts, however. In contrast, 65% and 45–50% of the water demand for irrigation is met for the winter–spring and summer–autumn crop life cycles, respectively, during severe and extreme droughts. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the water demand for irrigation could still be met 100% and 75–80% of the time during moderate, and extreme or severe droughts, respectively, through increased water use efficiency.

Transformative adaptation: from climate-smart to climate-resilient agriculture,,2662-4044,"Hellin, Jon","Fisher, Eleanor; Taylor, Marcus; Bhasme, Suhas; Loboguerrero, Ana María",Springer Science and Business Media LLC,CABI Agriculture and Bioscience,2023,"Volume 4, no. 1","In response to the climate crisis, there has been much focus on climate-smart agriculture (CSA); namely, technologies and practices that enhance adaptation, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and contribute to food security; the so-called triple win. Success has tended to be measured in terms of the number of farmers adopting CSA with less focus given to the impacts especially on human development. CSA can inadvertently lead to ‘maladaptation’ whereby interventions reinforce existing vulnerabilities either by benefitting powerful elites or by transferring risks and exposure between groups. Such maladaptive outcomes often stem from overly technical adaptation programming that is driven by external objectives and discounts the social and political dynamics of vulnerability. Increasingly a more nuanced picture is emerging. This reveals how a failure to contextualize CSA in relation to the structural socio-economic dynamics associated with agricultural systems that render some categories of farmer especially vulnerable to climate change, undermines CSA’s contribution to reducing rural poverty and increasing equity. In response, there is a growing focus on transformative orientations that pursue a more deep-seated approach to social, institutional, technological and cultural change in order to address the structural contributors to vulnerability and differential exposure to climate risk. Addressing these questions requires a robust consideration of the social contexts and power relations through which agriculture is both researched and practiced. For agriculture to be transformative and contribute to broader development goals, a greater emphasis is needed on issues of farmer heterogeneity, the dangers of maladaptation and the importance of social equity. This entails recognizing that resilience encompasses both agro- and socio-ecological dimensions. Furthermore, practitioners need to be more cognizant of the dangers of (i) benefiting groups of already better off farmers at the expense of the most vulnerable and/or (ii) focusing on farmers for whom agriculture is not a pathway out of poverty. The success of these approaches rests on genuine transdisciplinary partnerships and systems approaches that ensure adaptation and mitigation goals along with more equitable incomes, food security and development. The greater emphasis on social equity and human well-being distinguishes climate-resilient from climate-smart agricultureOpen access",English, climate change; climate-smart agriculture; development; equity; resilience; rural poverty; social change; technological change;climate-smart agriculture; adaptation; greenhouse gas emissions; food security; farmers; human development; exposure; vulnerability; agricultural systems,Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43170-023-00172-4,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IOZAERu8zyGUX1OkQvGB9Pu4lLHztHoz/view,JA

For alleviating these constraints, a wide range of technologies have been developed and introduced over the last three decades. These include water conservation technologies in rainfed and irrigated lowland rice, site-specific nutrient management practices, decision support tools such as crop growth simulation models, and labor-saving technologies.

This includes a new digital information system for labeling, tracking, and optional auditing of product-specific C-footprints that complements calculation tools developed to quantify GHG emissions and C-footprints. Collectively, these tools are used in different contexts to show their versatility for a variation of purposes.  Methods The digital system requires product-specific information on the rice value chain encompassing cultivation, harvest, and post-harvest processes. The tool provides comprehensive GHG data for tracking C-footprints along the value chain and generates a QR code that can be printed as a product label for marketing purposes. The 2nd and 3rd applications are based on calculation tools with coherent equations as the digital system but with different output formats and scopes. While this C-footprint data in the 2nd application encompasses the entire rice value chain, our 3rd application illustrates the intricacies of quantifying the climate change impacts of technological mitigation options in rice cultivation depending on different GHG metrics and time horizons.  Results and discussion The digital information system comprises a two-pronged approach for private sector applications: (i) GHG tracking along the rice value chain and (ii) product labeling for communicating information on product-specific C-footprints to end users. The principal distinction of GHG emission versus C-footprints was elucidated through (i) a sequential assessment of both parameters along the individual stages of the value chain and (ii) a comparative assessment of different yield levels showing that the reduction in C-footprints does not necessarily equal overall mitigation of GHG emissions in case of higher resource inputs. The juxtaposition of global warming potential (GWP), global temperature potential (GTP), and GWP* highlighted the pivotal role of the short-lived GHG CH4 in assessing potential mitigation impacts.

Development practitioners invest in scaling these to have a wider impact. We use the example of the Western Highlands in Guatemala to illustrate how a focus on the number of farmers adopting CSA can foster a tendency to homogenize farmers, instead of recognizing differentiation within farming populations. Poverty is endemic in the Western Highlands, and inequitable land distribution means that farmers have, on average, access to 0.06 ha per person. For many farmers, agriculture per se does not represent a pathway out of poverty, and they are increasingly reliant on non-agricultural income sources. Ineffective targeting of CSA, hence, ignores small-scale farming households’ different capacities for livelihood transformation, which are linked to the opportunities and constraints afforded by different livelihood pathways, agricultural and non-agricultural. Climate-smart interventions will often require a broader and more radical agenda that includes supporting farm households’ ability to build non-agricultural-based livelihoods.

Although specific definitions may vary, CSA is typically conceived as having three pillars, namely Adaptation, Food Security and Mitigation. These three pillars as such, however, do not suffice for assessing scaling potentials of different CSA technologies as several other drivers may accelerate or impede large-scale adoption. This paper introduces a systematic approach for a comparative assessment of technology-specific scaling potentials distinguishing among three clusters of criteria.  The ranking system requires scoring of CSA technologies by different stakeholder groups, namely farmers and extension workers/policy makers as well as research-based scoring. These scored values are then incorporated into a formula for calculating technology-specific ranking indices. This procedure also includes weighting factors to account for high and low significance of individual criteria for CSA scaling.  The entire scoring procedure is illustrated through the case of a Climate-smart Village in Laos which is dominated by rainfed rice with low resource inputs. Improvements of rice varieties and seed systems clearly emerged as the most promising CSA intervention.

Climate uncertainty and policy making—what do policy makers want to know?,,,"Meah, Nafees",,,Regional Environmental Change ,2019,(e-first copy); 11 pages.,"Abstract In climate change science, the existence of a high degree of uncertainty seems to be the cause of anxiety for many scientists because it appears to undermine the authority of the science. One of the assertions made by the so-called sceptics against the scientific consensus on climate change is that because the science is so uncertain, there is no basis for taking action. The response of the climate change science community has been to develop in-depth analyses of uncertainty of increasing sophistication and complexity. In most areas of policy making, the normal situation is characterised by complexity, ambiguity and uncertainty. Therefore, dealing with uncertainty is not an unusual state of affairs for policy makers. However, the overemphasis given to uncertainty in the climate science discourse by scientists working in the field has been self-defeating as it has led to confusion among the intended recipients of the policy relevant scientific knowledge and allowed room for scepticism to grow. Climate change scientists should instead communicate and engage with policy makers (and the public) on those things that we know with confidence.",English,,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-019-01492-w,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vTE07zSf0lsQtB-dfBg4uvg11LuQpBAG/view,JA
Metabolic responses of rice cultivars with different tolerance to combined drought and heat stress under field conditions,,,"Lawas, L. M. F.","Li, X.;Erban, A.;Kopka, J.;Krishna Jagadish, S. V.;Zuther, E.;Hincha, D. K.",,GigaScience  ,2019,"volume 8, no. 5; pages 1-21.","Background Rice is susceptible to both drought and heat stress, in particular during flowering and grain filling, when both grain yield and quality may be severely compromised. However, under field conditions, these 2 stresses rarely occur separately. Under well-watered conditions, plants avoid heat stress by transpirational cooling, while this is not possible under drought conditions. Although investigating combined drought and heat stress is clearly more agronomically relevant than analyzing the effects of the single stresses, only a few studies of this stress combination, in particular under field conditions, have been published. Results Three rice cultivars differing in drought and heat tolerance were grown in the field under control and drought conditions in 3 consecutive years. Drought was applied either during flowering or during early grain filling and resulted in simultaneous heat stress, leading to reduced grain yield and quality. Analysis by gas chromatography−mass spectrometry showed distinct metabolic profiles for the 3 investigated organs (flag leaves, flowering spikelets, developing seeds). The metabolic stress responses of the plants also strongly differed between cultivars and organs. Correlation analysis identified potential metabolic markers for grain yield and quality under combined drought and heat stress from both stress-regulated metabolites and from metabolites with constitutive differences between the cultivars. Conclusions Gas chromatography−mass spectrometry resolved metabolic responses to combined drought and heat stress in different organs of field-grown rice. The metabolite profiles can be used to identify potential marker metabolites for yield stability and grain quality that are expected to improve breeding efforts towards developing rice cultivars that are resilient to climate change.",English,,Crossref,https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giz050,https://drive.google.com/a/irri.org/file/d/1Ubg2A3liaeClhu5BXf7lP6t0qCP4kKXc/view?usp=drive_open,JA

In the face of changing climatic conditions, a successful transition from puddled to dry direct seeded rice (DDSR) cultivation system looks must in future. Genome-wide association study was performed for traits including, roots and nutrient uptake (14 traits), plant-morphological (5 traits), lodging-resistance (4 traits) and yield and yield attributing traits (7 traits) with the aim to identify significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) for traits enhancing rice adaptability to dry direct-seeded rice (DDSR) system.

"Plant sciences, public policies and food security",,,"Zeigler, Robert S.",,,Outlook on Agriculture,2019,(e-first copy); 9 pages.,"Food security was a major global concern in the second half of the 20th century. A positive feedback loop between public policy and technological innovation created abundant food supplies that averted predictions of famine and social chaos. Following the successful global effort to combat hunger, policy attention turned to problems of the environmental footprint of agriculture and other nutrition and diet-related health problems. Policies are developed in response to challenges presented by technology-induced change. As the rate of technological change accelerates, policy makers struggle to keep up and policies risk becoming irrelevant or stymying positive impact of innovation. Public or philanthropic investments created the foundation for private investment in technologies that have been widely adopted. As the public sector reduces its investments in research and development, it is not clear that the private sector has the appetite or means to make the needed investments. Examples of challenges facing agriculture and food security include access to and use of genetic resources, genetically modified crops and the global community’s ability to respond to and mitigate human-induced climate change. Proposed solutions to the world’s many serious challenges almost invariably involve some kind of coordinated and coherent multilateral institutional actions. Yet, today, global political trends appear to be shifting to more unilateral, bilateral and nationalistic perspectives hampering our capacity to respond effectively.",English,,Crossref,https://doi.org/10.1177/0030727019868776,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NA5RJUDaQ-W4x58Ivnh2Byyu-UTutWTh/view,JA

Ref.","This study comprises a comprehensive assessment, integration, and synthesis of data gathered from a 3-year field experiment conducted at four sites in Southeast Asia, namely Hue, Vietnam; Jakenan, Indonesia; Prachin Buri, Thailand; and Muñoz, Philippines, to assess the site-specific feasibility of alternate wetting and drying (AWD) as a greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation option in irrigated rice fields. AWD effectively reduced water use compared to continuous flooding (CF) but did not significantly reduce rice grain yield and soil carbon content in all sites. Methane (CH4) emissions varied significantly among sites and seasons as affected by soil properties and water management. AWD reduced CH4 emissions relative to CF by 151 (25%), 166 (37%), 9 (31%), and 22 (32%) kg CH4 ha−1 season−1 in Hue, Jakenan, Prachin Buri, and Muñoz, respectively. In Prachin Buri and Muñoz, AWD reduced CH4 emissions only during the dry season. Site-specific CH4 emission factors (EFs) ranged 0.13–4.50 and 0.08–4.88 kg CH4 ha−1 d−1 under CF and AWD, respectively. The mean AWD scaling factors (SFs) was 0.69 (95% confidence interval: 0.61–0.77), which is slightly higher than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’ SF for multiple aeration of 0.52 (error range: 0.41–0.66). Significant reductions in the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4+nitrous oxide (N2O) by AWD were observed in Hue and Jakenan (27.8 and 36.1%, respectively), where the contributions of N2O to the total GWP were only 0.8 and 3.5%, respectively. In Muñoz, however, CH4 emission reduction through AWD was offset by the increase in N2O emissions. The results indicate that the IPCC’s SF for multiple aeration may only be applied to irrigated rice fields where surface water level is controllable for a substantial period.

Ref.","Rice is the most important food crop in the developing world. For rice production systems to address the challenges of increasing demand and climate change, potential and on-farm yield increases must be increased. Breeding is one of the main strategies toward such aim. Here, we hypothesise that climatic and atmospheric changes for the upland rice growing period in central Brazil are likely to alter environment groupings and drought stress patterns by 2050, leading to changing breeding targets during the 21st century. As a result of changes in drought stress frequency and intensity, we found reductions in productivity in the range of 200-600 kg ha−1 (up to 20%) and reductions in yield stability throughout virtually the entire upland rice growing area (except for the south-east). In the face of these changes, our crop simulation analysis suggests that the current strategy of the breeding program, which aims at achieving wide adaptation, should be adjusted. Based on results for current and future climates, a weighted selection strategy for the three environmental groups that characterise the region is suggested. For the highly favourable environment (HFE, 36–41% growing area, depending on RCP), selection should be done under both stress-free and terminal stress conditions; for the favourable environment (FE, 27–40%), selection should aim at testing under reproductive and terminal stress; and for the least favourable environment (LFE, 23–27%), selection should be conducted for response to reproductive stress only and for the joint occurrence of reproductive and terminal stress. Even though there are differences in timing, it is noteworthy that stress levels are similar across environments, with 40–60% of crop water demand unsatisfied. Efficient crop improvement targeted toward adaptive traits for drought tolerance will enhance upland rice crop system resilience under climate change.",English,Brazil;Breeding programmes;Climatic factors;Climatic change;Drought stress;Drought tolerance;Plant breeding;Production,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14071,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wEUN2S22Pg7M7DW1onLox-BUSg8-5VlA/view,JA

The reference data consisted of 9852 randomly distributed sample points interpreted from Google Earth. We created methods to assess the maps and their combinations. Results show that the percentage of the Philippines covered by forest ranges among the maps from a low of 23% for the Philippine Land Cover to a high of 67% for GlobeLand30. Landsat VCF estimates 36% forest cover, which is closest to the 37% estimate based on the reference data. The eight maps plus the reference data agree unanimously on 30% of the sample points, of which 11% are attributable to forest and 19% to non-forest. The overall disagreement between the reference data and Philippine Land Cover is 21%, which is the least among the eight Forest versus Non-Forest maps. About half of the 9852 points have a nested structure such that the forest in a given dataset is a subset of the forest in the datasets that have more forest than the given dataset. The variation among the maps regarding forest quantity and allocation relates to the combined effects of the various definitions of forest and classification errors.

Maintaining agricultural growth while minimizing climate shocks is crucial to building a resilient food production system and meeting developmental goals in vulnerable countries. Experts have proposed several technological, institutional, and policy interventions to help farmers adapt to current and future weather variability and to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents the climate-smart village (CSV) approach as a means of performing agricultural research for development that robustly tests technological and institutional options for dealing with climatic variability and climate change in agriculture using participatory methods. It aims to scale up and scale out the appropriate options and draw out lessons for policy makers from local to global levels. The approach incorporates evaluation of climate-smart technologies, practices, services, and processes relevant to local climatic risk management and identifies opportunities for maximizing adaptation gains from synergies across different interventions and recognizing potential maladaptation and trade-offs. It ensures that these are aligned with local knowledge and link into development plans. This paper describes early results in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to illustrate different examples of the CSV approach in diverse agroecological settings. Results from initial studies indicate that the CSV approach has a high potential for scaling out promising climate-smart agricultural technologies, practices, and services. Climate analog studies indicate that the lessons learned at the CSV sites would be relevant to adaptation planning in a large part of global agricultural land even under scenarios of climate change.

Ref.","Water scarcity and economic incentives favor the introduction of upland crops into permanent paddy rice systems during dry seasons. However, introducing upland crops into permanently flooded cropping systems temporarily changes soil conditions from anaerobic to aerobic, affecting nitrogen (N) dynamics profoundly. We hypothesized that under maize and dry rice, total fertilizer 15N recovery in soil as well as the immobilization of fertilizer 15N in microbial residues is reduced compared with continuous paddy rice cropping. Furthermore, we expected enhanced emissions of fertilizer 15N in form of nitrous oxide (N2O) under maize and dry rice. To test these hypotheses, we traced the fate of a 15N-urea pulse in a field experiment in the Philippines with three different crop rotations: continuous paddy rice, paddy rice – dry rice, and paddy rice – maize for two years. Indeed, the 15N recovery in the first 5 cm of bulk soil was lowest in the paddy rice – maize rotation (arithmetic mean with standard error: 19.2 ± 1.8% of applied 15N), while twice as much was recovered in the first 5 cm of bulk soil of the continuous paddy rice cropping systems (37.8 ± 2.2% of applied 15N) during the first dry season. The 15N recovery in the plant biomass (shoots and roots) in the continuous paddy rice cropping was 13% larger than in the dry rice plant biomass and 5% larger than in the maize plant biomass during the first dry season. Fertilizer 15N remained longest in paddy rice – maize (mean residence time = 90 ± 25 days) and in continuous paddy rice (mean residence time = 77 ± 30 days), compared with dry rice – paddy rice rotation (mean residence time = 16 ± 5 days). After 2 years, 10% (paddy rice – dry rice, paddy rice – maize) to 23% (continuous paddy rice) of the applied fertilizer 15N were still stored in soil. The largest fraction of this 15N was immobilized by soil microbes, which stored 3–4% of applied 15N in the form of amino sugars as specific cell wall constituents, in all cropping systems. Nevertheless, introducing upland crops into continuous paddy rice systems likely increased N leaching losses and resulted in initial losses of urea- 15N to N2O, which thus has to be considered in climate smart mitigation strategies",English,Continuous cropping;Cropping systems;Fertilizers;Maize;Nutrient use efficiency;Upland rice,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.02.021,https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B-Hz5UNUXAiWdmF3SFdqRl92UFE,JA

Total carbon stored in the grassland ecosystem was reduced by up to 14%, depending on the severity of the degradation. Total nitrogen storage was reduced by almost 10% under severe degradation, but was slightly increased at light and intermediate degradation, indicating that grazing exclusion would not lead to an increase in nitrogen storage in the ecosystem. Over 98% of the total carbon and nitrogen stored in the grassland ecosystem was bound in the soil which provides the dominant and most stable carbon and nitrogen pool in the ecosystem. Most of the soil carbon and nitrogen storage was present in soil water-stable aggregates and was released as soil water-stable aggregates break in the course of grassland degradation.

MAS will need to address concerns about the population size needed to introgress together more than two genes/QTLs. In the present study, grain yield and genotypic data from different generations (F3 to F8) for five marker-assisted breeding programs were analyzed to understand the effectiveness of synergistic effect of phenotyping and genotyping in early generations on selection of better progenies.  Results  Based on class analysis of the QTL combinations, the identified superior QTL classes in F3/BC1F3/BC2F3 generations with positive QTL x QTL and QTL x background interactions that were captured through phenotyping maintained its superiority in yield under non-stress (NS) and reproductive-stage drought stress (RS) across advanced generations in all five studies. The marker-assisted selection breeding strategy combining both genotyping and phenotyping in early generation significantly reduced the number of genotypes to be carried forward. The strategy presented in this study providing genotyping and phenotyping cost savings of 25–68% compared with the traditional marker-assisted selection approach. The QTL classes, Sub1 + qDTY 1.1  + qDTY 2.1  + qDTY 3.1 and Sub1 + qDTY 2.1  + qDTY 3.1 in Swarna-Sub1, Sub1 + qDTY 1.1  + qDTY 1.2 , Sub1 + qDTY 1.1  + qDTY 2.2 and Sub1 + qDTY 2.2  + qDTY 12.1 in IR64-Sub1, qDTY 2.2  + qDTY 4.1 in Samba Mahsuri, Sub1 + qDTY 3.1  + qDTY 6.1  + qDTY 6.2 and Sub1 + qDTY 6.1  + qDTY 6.2 in TDK1-Sub1 and qDTY 12.1  + qDTY 3.1 and qDTY 2.2  + qDTY 3.1 in MR219 had shown better and consistent performance under NS and RS across generations over other QTL classes.  Conclusion  “Deployment of this procedure will save time and resources and will allow breeders to focus and advance only germplasm with high probability of improved performance. The identification of superior QTL classes and capture of positive QTL x QTL and QTL x background interactions in early generation and their consistent performance in subsequent generations across five backgrounds supports the efficacy of a combined MAS breeding strategy”.",English,Drought;Drought tolerance;Gene pyramiding;Grain yield;Marker-assisted selection;Quantitative trait loci,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12284-018-0227-0,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tBjH95D105PsOsgy_hNf8Jr4BLULEQrO/view,JA

Ref.","Fair distribution of benefits from index insurance matters. Lack of attention to social equity can reinforce inequalities and undermine the potential index insurance holds as a tool for climate risk management that is also pro‐poor.  Purpose  The aims are to: (i) examine social equity concerns raised by index insurance in the context of climate risk management; (ii) consider how greater attention can be given to social equity in index insurance initiatives; and (iii) reflect on the policy challenges raised by taking social equity into account as a mechanism for climate risk reduction.  Approach and methods  The article draws on learning from the CGIAR's Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and presents the cases of the Index Based Livelihoods Insurance (IBLI) and Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise Ltd. (ACRE) in East Africa. It proposes a framework for unpacking social equity related to equitable access, procedures, representation and distribution within index insurance schemes.  Findings  Systematically addressing social equity raises hard policy choices for index insurance initiatives without straightforward solutions. Attention to how benefits and burdens of index insurance are distributed raises the unpalateable truth for development policy that the poorest members of rural society can be excluded. Nevertheless, a focus on social equity may open up opportunities to ensure index insurance is linked to more socially just climate risk management. At the very least, it may prevent index insurance from generating greater inequality. Taking social equity into account, thus, shifts the focus from agricultural systems in transition per se to systems with potential to incorporate societal transformation through distributive justice.  Policy implications  A framework is presented for unpacking different dimensions of social equity in index insurance schemes. It is intended to facilitate identification of opportunities for building outcomes that are more equitable, with greater potential for inclusion and fairer distribution of benefits related to index insurance.",English,Climatic factors;Risk management;Socioeconomics;Agricultural insurance,Rice thesaurus;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref,https://doi.org/10.1111/dpr.12387,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eBSse_pWw5ksKZSMu0pgaeHsLPouD_7S/view,JA

G.;van Ittersum, M. K.",,Agricultural Systems ,2018,volume 165; pages 55-70.,"Abstract Understanding the opportunities for sustainable intensification requires an integrated assessment at field, farm and regional levels of past developments. Two hypotheses regarding current rice production in Central Luzon (Philippines) were developed for this purpose. First, we hypothesize that there are trade-offs between rice yields, labour productivity, gross margin and N use efficiency and, second, that farm(er) characteristics and socio-economic conditions at farm and regional level affect the management practices used by farmers. These hypotheses were tested using two household surveys characterizing rice-based farming systems in Central Luzon in terms of changes over time (1966–2012) and spatial variability. Over the past half-century there was an increase in the proportion of irrigated fields and adoption of improved varieties, which allowed the cultivation of a dry season rice crop in Central Luzon. Moreover, transplanting has been replaced by direct-seeding and herbicides substituted hand-weeding. These resulted in greater rice yields and labour productivity, and contributed to gradual transition from subsistence to commercial farming systems, as observed in the increasing proportion of hired labour and rice sold. Our results indicate the existence of a trade-off between rice yields, labour productivity and N use efficiency as yield levels maximising labour productivity and N use efficiency were ca. 25% and 35% lower than climatic potential yield in the wet and dry season, respectively. At field level, this can be explained by 1) the use of transplanting as crop establishment method, which resulted into higher yields but lower labour productivity as compared to direct-seeding, and 2) the high N application levels, which led to higher yields but lower N use efficiency. In contrast, yield levels which maximised gross margin were ca. 80% of the climatic potential in both wet and dry seasons, so there was little trade-off between rice yields and economic performance. Regarding the second hypothesis results were not always conclusive. As an example, N application per ha was negatively associated with farm size and the timing of the first fertiliser application positively associated with household size and with the number of parcels. More intensive practices, and better farm performance, were recorded in the province at the heart of the irrigation system. We thus conclude that closing rice yield gaps in the production systems of Central Luzon incurs trade-offs with environmental and social objectives at field and farm levels but less with economic objectives. However, we could not clearly show whether, and to what extent, management practices used by farmers are influenced by farm or regional level constraints.",English,Cropping systems;Direct sowing;Farmers;Farming systems;Flimatic factors;Intensification;Productivity;Weeding,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2018.05.008,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lXbik8D67hl3H6mcdTYezahBdWtGScJL/view,JA

D.;Meinzen-Dick, R.;Lopez-Ridaura, S.",,Ecology and Society ,2018,"volume 23, no. 3; 5 (11 pages).","ABSTRACT Climate change scenarios suggest largely detrimental impacts on agricultural production from a deterioration of renewable natural resources. Over the last 15 years, a new field of research has focused on the interactions between climate and conflict risk, particularly as it relates to competition over natural resources and livelihoods. Within this field, there has been less attention to the potential for resource competition to be managed in ways that yield greater cooperation, local adaptation capacity, social-ecological resilience, and conflict mitigation or prevention. The challenge of increasing social-ecological resilience in small-scale agriculture is particularly acute in the socioeconomically and agroecologically marginalized Western Highlands of Guatemala. Not only is climate change a threat to agriculture in this region, but adaptation strategies are challenged by the context of a society torn apart by decades of violent conflict. Indeed, the largely indigenous population in the Western Highlands has suffered widespread discrimination for centuries. The armed conflict has left a legacy of a deeply divided society, with communities often suspicious of outsider interventions and in many cases with neighbors pitted against each other. We use the example of the Buena Milpa agricultural development project to demonstrate how grassroots approaches to collective action, conflict prevention, and social-ecological resilience, linking local stakeholder dynamics to the broader institutional and governance context, can bear fruit amidst postconflict development challenges. Examples of microwatershed management and conservation of local maize varieties illustrate opportunities to foster community-level climate adaptation strategies within small-scale farming systems even in deeply divided societies.",English,Climate;Climatic change;Climatic factors;Farm income;Guatemala;Resource use efficiency,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-10250-230305,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VMfPfcVc6i7AfeACYEZOBOG8tjtSMsFP/view,JA

Weather index insurance (WII) could reduce some of the problems associated with traditional, indemnity-based insurance programs, but uptake has been lower than expected. One reason is that WII contracts are not yet sufficiently tailored to the needs and preferences of smallholder farmers. This study combines survey and choice-experimental data from Kenya to analyze the experience with an existing WII program and how specific changes in the contractual design might encourage uptake.  Results  Many smallholders struggle with fully understanding the functioning of the program, which undermines their confidence. Regular provision of relevant rainfall measurements and thresholds would significantly increase farmers’ willingness to pay for WII. Mechanisms to reduce basis risk are also positively valued by farmers, although not to the same extent as higher levels of transparency. Finally, offering contracts to small groups rather than individual farmers could increase insurance uptake.  Conclusions  Better training on WII and regular communication are needed. Group contracts may help to reduce transaction costs. Farmer groups can also be important platforms for learning about complex innovations, including novel risk transfer products. These concrete results are specific to Kenya; however, they provide some broader policy-relevant insights into typical issues of WII in a small-farm context.",English,Climatic factors;Farmers;Farmers' attitudes;Kenya;Small farms,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40066-018-0200-6,https://drive.google.com/file/d/15fxnkNQ2sTTtEeWIa3_1uGxWpzRtdSaz/view,JA

We overexpressed the rice epidermal patterning factor OsEPF1, creating plants with substantially reduced stomatal density and correspondingly low stomatal conductance. Low stomatal density rice lines were more able to conserve water, using c. 60% of the normal amount between weeks 4 and 5 post germination. When grown at elevated atmospheric CO2, rice plants with low stomatal density were able to maintain their stomatal conductance and survive drought and high temperature (40°C) for longer than control plants. Low stomatal density rice gave equivalent or even improved yields, despite a reduced rate of photosynthesis in some conditions.

Several studies have indicated a long-term reduction in CH4 emissions, even after re-flooding, suggesting that the mechanism goes beyond creating temporary oxidized conditions in the soil. In this pot trial, the effects of different drainage patterns on straw-derived CH4 and CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions were compared to identify the balance between straw-carbon CH4 and CO2 emissions influenced by soil aeration over different periods, including effects of drainage on emissions during re-flooding. The water treatments included were: continuous flooding [C] as the control and five drainage patterns (pre-planting drainage [P], early-season drainage [E], midseason drainage [M], pre-planting plus midseason drainage [PM], early-season-plus-midseason drainage [EM]). An equal amount of 13C-enriched rice straw was applied to all treatments to identify straw-derived 13C-gas emissions from soil carbon derived emissions.  The highest fluxes of CH4 and δ13C-CH4 were recorded from the control treatment in the first week after straw application. The CH4 flux and δ13C-CH4 were reduced the most (0.1–0.8 μg CH4 g−1 soil day−1 and -13 to −34‰) in the pre-planting and pre-planting plus midseason drainage treatments at day one after transplanting. Total and straw-derived CH4 emissions were reduced by 69% and 78% in pre-planting drainage and 77% and 87% in pre-planting plus midseason drainage respectively, compared to control. The early-season, midseason, pre-planting plus midseason and early-season-plus-midseason drainage treatments resulted in higher total and straw-derived CO2 emissions compared to the control and pre-planting drainage treatments. The pre-planting and pre-planting plus midseason drainage treatments lowered the global warming potential by 47–53%, and early-season and early-season-plus-midseason drainage treatments reduced it by 24–31% compared to control. By using labelled crop residues, this experiment demonstrates a direct link between early drainage and reduced CH4 emissions from incorporated crop residues, eventually leading to a reduction in total global warming potential. It is suggested that accelerated decomposition of the residues during early season drainage prolonged the reduction in CH4 emissions. Therefore, it is important to introduce the early drainage as an effective measure to mitigate CH4 emissions from crop residues.",English,Carbon dioxide;Climatic change;Climatic factors;Climatic factors;Emissions;Flooding;Methane emission;Rice straw;Soil chemicophysical properties;Transplanting,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.080,https://drive.google.com/file/d/17CMrdoNHYA_-bCGaRZKVDi8IuM1utj_X/view,JA

In a precursor study on the high-tillering cv. IR72 we showed that the plasticity is adaptive by enabling yield stability across different stand densities, and we presented and validated the functional-structural crop model SAMARA, developed for the study of phenotypic plasticity. The present study analyses the phenotypic plasticity of high and low tillering plant types. Twelve contrasting, high-yielding irrigated rice genotypes were studied for the plasticity of traits contributing to grain yield under different season/site environments and stand densities in the Philippines. For the density factor, sequentially developing yield components along phenology, beginning with tillering, showed decreasing plasticity, indicating progressive adjustment to the initial stand density. For the site/season factor (climate), tillering was less plastic and panicle size and grain filling ratio provided for the strongest adjustments. Large plasticity was observed also for LAI and little plasticity for SLA and leaf morphology, particularly blade width. Genotypes differed strongly in organ size vs. number (leaves, panicles), representing organ “number” or “size” plant types. Up to 10 Mg ha−1 grain yield were observed for both extreme types. The plasticity of panicle size was caused by variation in spikelet number and not kernel weight. All genotypes were able to fully adjust yield components to differential plant stand density, resulting in unchanged yield. However, between environments, genotypes having greatest maximal yields and those having stable (but on average smaller) yields showed different patterns of phenotypic plasticity for yield component and plant morphology traits. The SAMARA model was calibrated for five genotypes showing contrasting morphology and plasticity. It was able to predict most of the genotypes’ variation in morphological and yield component traits.

One such cropping systems model is the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM).

Farmer participatory field studies were conducted in Raichur District of Karnataka State, India to assess the performance of DDSR cultivars ( Samba Mahsuri, Gangavathi Sona and Prasanna ) seeded during the rainy season in rotation with dryland crops (chickpea, mustard and green gram) following rice. Among the three rice cultivars, Gangavathi Sona yielded 9% and 15% higher than Samba Mahsuri and Prasanna, respectively. Our study showed that productivity of rice can be improved by using drought resistant and high yielding cultivars with high harvest index, and stable canal water supply at the reproductive stage. Chickpea and green gram yielded better than mustard under minimal soil aeration conditions of zero-tilled and non-puddled fields which indicate that suitable post-rainy season crops for zero- tilled fields must be selected. The study revealed that sowing time, which depends on rainfall pattern and schedule of canal water supply, is among the major factors to be considered in selecting rice cultivars and dryland crops to achieve higher productivity, resource use efficiency and economic returns. Cropping system involving direct dry-seeding of Gangavathi Sona, followed by chickpea achieved higher production efficiency, land and water productivity, and economic returns compared to transplanted rice (TPR) system.

However, the response of rice photosynthesis to aerosol-induced radiative perturbations is still not well understood. Here, we employ a process-based modelling approach to simulate changes in incoming radiation (RAD) and the diffuse radiation fraction (DF) with aerosol mitigation in China and their associated impacts on rice yields. Aerosol reduction has the positive effect of increasing RAD and the negative effect of decreasing DF on rice photosynthesis and yields. In rice production areas where the average RAD during the growing season is lower than 250 W m−2, aerosol reduction is beneficial for higher rice yields, whereas in areas with RAD>250 W m−2, aerosol mitigation causes yield declines due to the associated reduction in the DF, which decreases the light use efficiency. As a net effect, rice yields were estimated to significantly increase by 0.8%–2.6% with aerosol concentrations reductions from 20 to 100%, which is lower than the estimates obtained in earlier studies that only considered the effects of RAD. This finding suggests that both RAD and DF are important processes influencing rice yields and should be incorporated into future assessments of agricultural responses to variations in aerosol-induced radiation under climate change.",English,,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aa80f0,https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByGk26Nk_MlAWUkzc3BwVUZOSzg/view,JA

A mapping population consisting of 480 lines derived from a cross between Dular (drought-tolerant) and IR64-21 (drought susceptible) was used. QTL analysis revealed three major consistent-effect QTLs for grain yield (qDTY1.1, qDTY1.3, and qDTY8.1) under non-stress and reproductive-stage drought stress conditions, and 2 QTLs for root traits (qRT9.1 for root-growth angle and qRT5.1 for multiple root traits, i.e., seedling-stage root length, root dry weight and crown root number). The genetic locus qDTY1.1 was identified as hotspot for grain yield and yield-related agronomic and root traits.

The model ensemble reproduced the experimental results well. However, yield prediction in response to E-[CO2] varied significantly among the rice models. The variation was not random: models that overestimated at one experiment simulated greater yield enhancements at the others. The variation was not associated with model structure or magnitude of photosynthetic response to E-[CO2] but was significantly associated with the predictions of leaf area. This suggests that modelled secondary effects of E-[CO2] on morphological development, primarily leaf area, are the sources of model uncertainty. Rice morphological development is conservative to carbon acquisition. Uncertainty will be reduced by incorporating this conservative nature of the morphological response to E-[CO2] into the models. Nitrogen levels, particularly under limited situations, make the prediction more uncertain.

Data were aggregated using a composite index, and vulnerability in four villages was compared. Our assessment shows that caution is warranted in terms of the assumption that we make about adaptive capacity. A higher adaptive capacity of the communities in vulnerability index does not necessarily imply that they are less vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and change and vice versa. Highly vulnerable villages to climate risks are also the ones involved in various adaptation actions in agriculture. The findings further suggests that although vulnerability indices are helpful in identifying vulnerable people and places, there is a need to examine multiple stressors that interacts with socio-economic and biophysical vulnerability of communities. Results shows that highly vulnerable villages are characterized by features such as high levels of poverty, high levels of borrowing, less crop diversity, with agriculture as the only source of income and low level of agricultural insurance.

During some plant-pathogen interactions, heat stress allows pathogens to overcome host resistance, a phenomenon which could severely impact crop productivity considering the global warming trends associated with climate change. Despite the importance of this phenomenon, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. To better understand host plant responses during simultaneous heat and pathogen stress, we conducted a transcriptomics experiment for rice plants (cultivar IRBB61) containing Xa7, a bacterial blight disease resistance (R) gene, that were infected with Xanthomonas oryzae, the bacterial blight pathogen of rice, during high temperature stress. Xa7-mediated resistance is unusual relative to resistance mediated by other R genes in that it functions better at high temperatures. Using RNA-Seq technology, we identified 8,499 differentially expressed genes as temperature responsive in rice cultivar IRBB61 experiencing susceptible and resistant interactions across three time points. Notably, genes in the plant hormone abscisic acid biosynthesis and response pathways were up-regulated by high temperature in both mock-treated plants and plants experiencing a susceptible interaction and were suppressed by high temperature in plants exhibiting Xa7-mediated resistance. Genes responsive to salicylic acid, an important plant hormone for disease resistance, were down-regulated by high temperature during both the susceptible and resistant interactions, suggesting that enhanced Xa7-mediated resistance at high temperature is not dependent on salicylic acid signaling. A DNA sequence motif similar to known abscisic acid-responsive cis-regulatory elements was identified in the promoter region upstream of genes up-regulated in susceptible but down-regulated in resistant interactions. The results of our study suggest that the plant hormone abscisic acid is an important node for cross-talk between plant transcriptional response pathways to high temperature stress and pathogen attack.

In this study, the modeling technology with the rice model ORYZA (v3) was used to identify appropriate rainfed rice growing seasons for a better adaptation of farmers to climate variability. The potential yields, the favorable sowing periods, the optimum sowing dates, and the attainable yields of two contrasted cultivars were determined.

To introduce the environment we provide an overview of general characteristics with a more detailed analysis of soil quality in rice-based rainfed lowlands around the world. Reviewed management technologies to mitigate drought stress include water management options, the choice of appropriate germplasm, adjusted cropping systems, improved nutrient management, different crop establishment options, better field management and soil amelioration. Several of these technologies do offer important advantages but their usefulness and applicability is dependent on site and system characteristics. Thus, a combination of germplasm × environment × management is necessary to choose the best management for a given rainfed lowland system. Getting this right can transform rice-based systems in rainfed lowlands, make them more productive, and increase and stabilize farmers’ income.",English,,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2016.02.001,https://docs.google.com/a/irri.org/file/d/0ByGk26Nk_MlAckpGZ240WWdNZUE/view,JA

Ref.","Rice bacterial blight (BB) is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and is responsible for substantial yield loss worldwide. Host resistance remains the most feasible control measure. However, pathogen variability leads to the failure of certain resistance genes to control the disease, and climate change with high amplitudes of heat predisposes the host plant to pathogen invasion. Due to pressure in natural selection, landrace species often carry a wide range of unique traits conferring tolerance of stress. Therefore, exploring their genetic background for host resistance could enable the identification of broad-spectrum resistance to combined abiotic and biotic stresses. Nineteen Oryza glaberrima accessions and O. sativa rice variety SUPA were evaluated for BB resistance under high temperature (35 and 31°C day and night, respectively) using 14 X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains originated from the Philippines. Under normal temperature, most of the accessions showed resistance to 9 strains (64.3%) and accession TOG6007 showed broad-spectrum resistance to 12 strains (85.7%). Under high temperature, most accessions showed a reduction in BB disease, whereas, accession TOG5620 showed disease reduction from all the X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains under high temperature. Molecular characterization using gene-based and linked markers for BB resistance genes Xa4, xa5, Xa7, xa13, and Xa21 revealed the susceptible alleles of Xa4, xa5, xa13, and Xa21 in O. glaberrima. However, no allele of Xa7 was detected among O. glaberrima accessions. Our results suggest that O. glaberrima accessions contain a BB resistance different from the Xa gene type.

For a given cultivar, the difference in growing season temperature (GST) varied between 2.2 and 8.2 °C in different trials, which allowed us to calibrate the models for lower GST and validate under higher GST, with three calibration experiments. The results show that in warmer climates the bilinear and beta phenology models resulted in gradually increasing bias for phenology predication and double yield bias per percent increase in phenology simulation bias, while the GDD and exponential models maintained a comparatively constant bias. The phenology biases were primarily attributed to varying phenological patterns to temperature in models, rather than on the size of the calibration dataset.

Towards this it is essential to understand the climate change perceptions, adaptation practices and barriers to effective adaptation at household and community level. This paper using household surveys and focus group discussions in one of the drought prone areas of Odisha in India, explores various aspects of perception on climate change and barriers to adaptation. It also analyses the accuracy of perceptions based on rainfall data from nearest meteorological stations. The study reinforces the argument by earlier studies that the perception by people simply cannot be wrong because they may have a just a low correlation with underlying meteorological data. Results suggest that farmers increasingly perceive the changes in the rainfall and temperature patterns. However, when compared with the trend in actual rainfall data, perceptions on rainfall are found to more closely align with the results from the nearest station as compared to the station farther from it. Analysis revealed that seasonal rainfall variability has a profound influence on the farmers’ perceptions on climate change and drought in the study region. Farmers’ are still dependent on the traditional forecasting system because of the lack of access to modern climate forecasting and tailored information for agricultural practice. Although farmers in the study region are already adapting to the changing climate, the study finds that while lack of access to water and irrigation, information on climate change adaptation and early warning systems are major barriers to adaptation at the household level lack of government intervention, lack of knowledge on drought resistant crops and varieties and lack of renovation of water bodies and irrigation were mentioned as the major barriers at the community level.

In Lao PDR, like other rice producing countries in Asia, water resources are becoming increasingly scarce due to effect of climate change and increasing competition on the use of water between sectors. Consequently, there is a need to develop alternative rice production systems that require less water and increase the water productivity. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation in rice is a mature technology that decreases water use by 15 – 30% without reducing yields. AWD has been widely adopted in China and is becoming a recommended practice in water-scarce irrigated areas in South and Southeast Asia.

We found that grain yield of double-season rice crops in the subtropical environment of Wuxue County, Hubei Province, China was 9–66% higher than that in the tropical environment of International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines.

Average daily minimum and maximum temperature from transplanting to maturity at IRRI was 3.4 and 1.9 °C higher than that at Wuxue, respectively, whereas average daily solar radiation at Wuxue was lower or similar to that at IRRI. Crop’s efficiency in converting solar radiation into biomass (i.e. radiation use efficiency, RUE) at Wuxue was 48% higher than that at IRRI, which was associated with the difference in temperature between the two environments.

During four cropping seasons in 2011–13, alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation was applied in the triple rice production area within An Giang Province, Vietnam. An issue with the application of AWD is the prevalence of acid sulphate soils in the Mekong Delta. Three types of irrigation management were tested; continuously flooded (CF) where the water in the paddy was maintained at 5 cm; AWD where the water level was allowed to fall to 15 cm below the ground surface, at which point the field was irrigated until the water level was at 1 cm above the ground surface (designated −15 cm); AWD where the water level was allowed to fall to 30 cm below the ground surface before irrigation until the water level was at 1 cm above the ground surface (designated −30 cm). Two further experiments were also undertaken which examined the planting method (transplant v. direct sowing) and phosphorus rate on rice yield. There was no effect on yield caused by P fertilizer rate and irrigation management in any year, and there was no significant effect on soil pH or salinity caused by irrigation management. Overall net profitability was greatest for the AWD treatments because of the reduction in pumping and labour costs in the dry season. Transplanted rice improved yields, but the labour cost reduced overall profitability.

Field warming experiments produce a substantial rice yield loss under warming, with an average temperature sensitivity of −5.2 ± 1.4% K−1. Local crop models give a similar sensitivity (−6.3 ± 0.4% K−1), but statistical and global gridded crop models both suggest less negative impacts of warming on yields (−0.8 ± 0.3% and −2.4 ± 3.7% K−1, respectively).

Ref.","Methane (CH4) emissions from rice paddies often show significant diurnal variations, most likely driven by diurnal changes of radiation and temperature in air, floodwater, and soil. Field measurements, however, are often scheduled at a fixed time of a given measuring day, thereby neglecting sub-daily variations of CH4 emissions. Here we evaluated diurnal patterns of CH4 emissions from traditional paddy rice production as observed during field measurements in the Philippines. Field emissions were measured during three consecutive cropping seasons using an automated chamber and gas sampling system with fluxes being obtained every 4 h. Methane fluxes were monitored with a total of nine chambers during the dry seasons in 2012 and 2013 and 27 chambers during the wet season in 2012. Significant and consistent diurnal patterns of CH4 emissions were mainly observed from the start of field flooding until the middle of cropping periods, i.e., periods with low leaf area of the rice crop. Our data show that disregarding the diurnal variability of fluxes results in an average overestimation of seasonal CH4 emissions of 22% (16–31%) if measurements were conducted only around noon. Scheduling manual sampling either at early morning (7:00–9:00) or evening (17:00–19:00) results in estimations of seasonal emissions within 94–101% of the “true” value as calculated from multiple daily flux measurements. Alternatively, uncertainties of seasonal emissions can be reduced to an average of ≤3% by applying sinus function or Gauss function-based correction factors. Application of correction factors allows the performance of flux measurements at any time of day. We also investigated N2O emissions from rice paddies with respect to diurnal variations, but did not find, as in the case of CH4, any significant and persistent diurnal pattern.",English,Methane;Methane emission;Greenhouse gases;Greenhouse effect;Climatic factors,Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1002/jpln.201500092,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nhcJnAlLhJquXEK906WbuHj8WEbwtmN6/view,JA

The need to increase yields is commonly achieved by agricultural intensification that often comes along with negative impacts on the environment. In 2011, the interdisciplinary LEGATO project was launched with the aim to advance sustainable rice production. A key feature for sustainable rice production is silicon (Si) availability. Si can e.g. improve rice crop resistance against pathogens and prevent the uptake of toxic metals. Herein, we introduce the characteristics of the seven LEGATO study regions in Vietnam and the Philippines (i.e., climate, geology, soils, agricultural practices) ranging from lowlands with intensive production to mountain regions with extensive and traditional production systems. Secondly, we show data on concentrations of plant-available Si (Sipa) in topsoils of paddy fields (Ap + Arp horizons) and of sites with an alternative land-use (forest, upland crops), and discuss factors determining spatial differences in Sipa concentrations. Results show that Sipa concentrations in topsoils of paddies (assessed by acetate extraction) greatly differ between Philippine (141–322 mg Si kg−1) and Vietnamese (20–51 mg Si kg−1) regions. This can be explained by differences in geo-/pedologic conditions between the countries. Large Sipa concentrations in the Philippines are due to recent rock formation by active volcanism, hence, by a large Sipa input due to mineral weathering in recent geologic history. Land-use can also affect Sipa in topsoils: in Philippine regions, Sipa concentrations were significantly larger for paddies than for other land-use types. In some of the Vietnamese paddies, Sipa concentrations are below critical values, thus might limit plant growth. Many Vietnamese farmers export Si from fields by removing straw residues with the harvest. Our subsequent research thus aims to test whether changes in harvest residue management can improve the Si supply to plants in Vietnamese regions",English,,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2014.08.002,https://drive.google.com/a/irri.org/file/d/0ByGk26Nk_MlAaUF1dzMwX0p5T3c/view,JA

Rice is a principle food in Vietnam and plays an important role in economy of the country. However, rice yield and its cultivating areas are adversely affected from the threats of devastation caused by the rise of sea level. Using marker assisted backcrossing (MABC) to develop a new salt tolerance rice variety is one of the feasible methods to cope with these devastating changes. To improve rice salt tolerance in Bac Thom 7 cultivar, FL478 was used as a donor parent to introgress the saltol QTL conferring salt tolerance into Bac Thom 7. Three backcrosses were conducted to transfer positive alleles of saltol from FL478 into Bac Thom 7. The plants number IL-30 and IL-32 in BC3F1 population expected recurrent genome recovery of up to 99.2%, 100%, respectively. These selected lines that carried the saltol alleles were screened in field for their agronomic traits. All improved lines had saltol allele similar to the donor parent FL478, whereas their agronomic performances were the same as the original Bac Thom 7. We show here the success of improving rice salt tolerance by MABC and the high efficiency of selection in early generations.

It is therefore essential to develop rice varieties which are climate change ready and with stable yield when grown under low inputs of irrigation water and fertilizer. In this study, the effects of the shift from temperate to tropical environment as well as the different levels of water regime-phosphorus application were evaluated using a set of temperate recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Dasanbyeo (Tongil-type indica) and TR22183 (temperate japonica). Here, we have identified genetic mechanisms for yield stability mainly by observing the panicle length in the RILs and the parental lines. TR22183 grown in the Philippines showed no reduction in panicle length whereas the Dasanbyeo exhibited a considerable reduction in panicle length when grown in the Philippines compared to those grown in Korea. In the RILs, a total of 18 QTLs for panicle length were identified across 12 chromosomes except in chromosomes 6 and 7. There were six interesting panicle length QTLs, qPL1.4, qPL2.1, qPL2.2, qPL4.1, qPL9.2, and qPL11.2 on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 9, and 11 respectively. They were clustered together with other yield-related QTLs such as spikelet number and grain number in two different years. Except for qPL2.1, all the beneficial alleles originated from TR22183. The panicle length QTLs were identified across different water-P treatments. Interestingly, qPL1.4, qPL2.1, qPL4.1, and qPL11.2 were constantly detected in the low-input tropical condition.

CO and LT were used for further analysis to determine the defence related biochemical and transcriptome changes associated with HT induced resistance, and the contrasting reactions to Mo observed in CO and LT despite carrying the same R gene. Pre-exposure to 35 °C triggered intense callose deposits and cell wall fluorescence of the attacked epidermal cells, as well as, increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and salicylic acid (SA) levels. On the other hand, transcriptional changes due to combined stress (35 °C + Mo) were largely overridden by pathogen infection in both backgrounds, suggesting that the plants tended to shift their response to the pathogen. However, significant differences in global gene expression patterns occurred between CO and LT backgrounds in response to both single (35 °C and Mo) and double stress (35 °C + Mo). Collectively, our results suggest that rice lines carrying Pi54 respond to Mo by rapid induction of callose and H2O2, and that these resistance mechanisms are amplified at HT. The relative difference in disease severity between CO and LT at 28 °C suggests that the genetic background of japonica rice facilitates the function of Pi54 more than the background of indica rice. The phenotypic plasticity and gene expression differences between CO and LT backgrounds reveal the presence of intricate molecular signatures that may potentially influence adaptation to plant stresses.",English,,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2017.02.004,https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByGk26Nk_MlAOHFzQjVzbllvaVU/view,JA
Crop health and its global impacts on the components of food security,,,"Savary, S.","Bregaglio, S.;Willocquet, L.;Gustafson, D.;Mason D'Croz, D.;Sparks, A.;Castilla, N.;Djurle, A.;Allinne, C.;Sharma, M.;Rossi, V.;Amorim, L.;Bergamin, A.;Yuen, J.;Esker, P.;McRoberts, N.;Avelino, J. ;Duveiller, E.;Koo, J.;Garrett, K.",,Food Security,2017,"(e-first copy): 17 pages, ill. Ref.","The literature on the importance of plant pathogens sometimes emphasizes their possible role in historical food shortages and even in famines. Aside from such major crises, plant pathogens should also be seen as important reducers of crop performances, with impacts on system sustainability, from the ecological, agronomical, social, and economic standpoints – all contributing ultimately to affecting food security. These views need reconciliation in order to produce a clearer picture of the multidimensional effects of plant disease epidemics. Such a picture is needed for disease management today, but would also be useful for future policies. This article attempts to develop a framework that would enable assessment of the impacts of plant diseases, referred collectively to as crop health, on food security via its components. We have combined three different existing definitions of food security in order to develop a framework consisting of the following six components: (1) Availability. Primary production; (2) Availability. Import - Stockpiles; (3) Access. Physical and supply chain; (4) Access. Economic; (5) Stability of food availability; (6) Utility-Safety-Quality-Nutritive value. In this framework, components of food security are combined with three attributes of production situations: the nature of the considered crop (i.e. food- or non-food), the structure of farms (i.e. subsistence or commercial), and the structure of markets (i.e. weakly organized and local, to strongly organized and globalized). The resulting matrix: [Food security components] × [Attributes of production situations] provides a framework where the impacts of chronic, acute, and emerging plant disease epidemics on food security can be examined. We propose that, given the number of components and interactions at play, a systems modelling approach is required to address the functioning of food systems exposed to plant disease risks. This approach would have application in both the management of the current attrition of crop performances by plant diseases, and also of possible disease-induced shocks. Such an approach would also enable quantifying shifts in disease vulnerability of production situations, and therefore, of food systems, as a result of climate change, globalization, and evolving crop health.",English,,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12571-017-0659-1,https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByGk26Nk_MlAbC1sa0pVeW5PVVU/view,JA
Climate change skepticism and index versus standard crop insurance demand in coastal Bangladesh,,,"Akter, S.","Krupnik, T.

Ref.","This paper investigates if climate change skepticism, farmers’ fatalistic beliefs, and insurance plan design influence interest in crop weather insurance. While studies of the influence of fatalism on disaster preparedness are common, the ways in which fatalism influences climate change skepticism, and in turn affects farmers’ interest in crop insurance, have not been previously investigated. An additional objective was to understand farmers’ preferences for index versus standard insurance options, the former entailing damage compensation based on post-hazard assessment, the latter tying damage compensation to a set of weather parameter thresholds. A discrete choice experiment was conducted with maize farmers on a climate-risk prone island in coastal Bangladesh. Most farmers were insurance averse. Those who chose insurance were however significantly more likely to select standard as opposed to index-based insurance. Insurance demand was significantly and positively correlated with farmers’ concern about the adverse livelihood impacts of climate change. Farmers who exhibited fatalistic views regarding the consequences of climate change were significantly less likely to opt for insurance of either kind. These findings imply that the prospect for farmers’ investment in insurance is conditioned by their understanding of climate change risks and the utility of adaptation, in addition to insurance scheme design.",English,,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-017-1174-9,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uK1yZOZaFFXWrU15lmSECnyJs0BerggO/view,JA
Perception of climate change and adaptation strategies in Vietnam: are there intra-household gender differences?,,,"Mishra, A. K.","Pede, V.

Ref.","Purpose This study first examines the factors affecting the intra-household perception of climate change. Secondly, the study investigates the impact of the perception of climatic stress on operators’ and spouses’ intra-household adaptation strategies (farm and household financial strategies).  Design/methodology/approach The study uses household survey data from Vietnam’s Mekong Delta. The study uses probit and negative binomial count data approaches to evaluate the empirical model.  Findings Results confirm the existence of intra-household gender differences in the adaptation strategies. The authors found that although spouses perceive climatic stress, they are less likely to adapt to such stresses when it comes farming enterprise, but more likely to adapt to household financial strategies. On the other hand, farm operators, in the presence of climatic stresses, undertake both farm and household finance adaptation strategies.  Practical implications Investment in climate smart agriculture can help households in managing climatic stresses.  Originality/value A farmer in Asia, and Vietnam in particular faces significant risks from climatic changes. In Vietnam, agriculture is easily affected by natural disasters and climatic changes. This study provides insights into the perception of climatic changes by operators and spouses in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta. Perceived changes in the climate have a greater impact on women because they typically lack the necessary tools to adapt to climate change. The current findings could be useful in managing climatic risk in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta; helpful to policymakers in designing risk management strategies, in response to climatic changes.",English,,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1108/IJCCSM-01-2017-0014,https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByGk26Nk_MlAYS1UUkx2MU9kMkU/view;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H1p5lNVWBYErnUhWCxYU9OQmnsmzyaGL/view,JA
The influence of gender and product design on farmers’ preferences for weather-indexed crop insurance,,,"Akter, S.","Krupnik, T. J.;Rossi, F.;Khanam, F.",,Global Environmental Change 38 (2016): 217-229.,2016,volume 38; pages 217-229.,"Theoretically, weather-index insurance is an effective risk reduction option for small-scale farmers in low income countries. Renewed policy and donor emphasis on bridging gender gaps in development also emphasizes the potential social safety net benefits that weather-index insurance could bring to women farmers who are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change risk and have low adaptive capacity. To date, no quantitative studies have experimentally explored weather-index insurance preferences through a gender lens, and little information exists regarding gender-specific preferences for (and constraints to) smallholder investment in agricultural weather-index insurance. This study responds to this gap, and advances the understanding of preference heterogeneity for weather-index insurance by analysing data collected from 433 male and female farmers living on a climate change vulnerable coastal island in Bangladesh, where an increasing number of farmers are adopting maize as a potentially remunerative, but high-risk cash crop. We implemented a choice experiment designed to investigate farmers’ valuations for, and trade-offs among, the key attributes of a hypothetical maize crop weather-index insurance program that offered different options for bundling insurance with financial saving mechanisms. Our results reveal significant insurance aversion among female farmers, irrespective of the attributes of the insurance scheme. Heterogeneity in insurance choices could however not be explained by differences in men’s and women’s risk and time preferences, or agency in making agriculturally related decisions. Rather, gendered differences in farmers’ level of trust in insurance institutions and financial literacy were the key factors driving the heterogeneous preferences observed between men and women. Efforts to fulfill gender equity mandates in climate-smart agricultural development programs that rely on weather-index insurance as a risk-abatement tool are therefore likely to require a strengthening of institutional credibility, while coupling such interventions with financial literacy programs for female farmers.",English,,Rice thesaurus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2016.03.010,https://docs.google.com/a/irri.org/file/d/0ByGk26Nk_MlAWmJYY2Y2RGdyTWc/view,JA

May ","Climate envelope models (CEMs) have been used to predict the distribution of species under current, past, and future climatic conditions by inferring a species' environmental requirements from localities where it is currently known to occur. CEMs can be evaluated for their ability to predict current species distributions but it is unclear whether models that are successful in predicting current distributions are equally successful in predicting distributions under different climates (i.e. different regions or time periods). We evaluated the ability of CEMs to predict species distributions under different climates by comparing their predictions with those obtained with a mechanistic model (MM). In an MM the distribution of a species is modeled based on knowledge of a species' physiology. The potential distributions of 100 plant species were modeled with an MM for current conditions, a past climate reconstruction (21 000 years before present) and a future climate projection (double preindustrial CO2 conditions). Point localities extracted from the currently suitable area according to the MM were used to predict current, future, and past distributions with four CEMs covering a broad range of statistical approaches: Bioclim (percentile distributions), Domain (distance metric), GAM (general additive modeling), and Maxent (maximum entropy). Domain performed very poorly, strongly underestimating range sizes for past or future conditions. Maxent and GAM performed as well under current climates as under past and future climates. Bioclim slightly underestimated range sizes but the predicted ranges overlapped more with the ranges predicted with the MM than those predicted with GAM did. Ranges predicted with Maxent overlapped most with those produced with the MMs, but compared with the ranges predicted with GAM they were more variable and sometimes much too large. Our results suggest that some CEMs can indeed be used to predict species distributions under climate change, but individual modeling approaches should be validated for this purpose, and model choice could be made dependent on the purpose of a particular study.",English,Carbon dioxide.;Climatic change.;Crop weed competition.;Cropping systems.;Cultural control.;Fertilizers.;Integrated control.;Invasions.;Plant ecology.;Ploughing.;Rain.;Reproduction.;Rotations.;Seedbeds.;Sowing date.;Sowing rates.;Temperature.;Varieties.;Weed control.;Weeds.;Wheat.,Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus,,https://drive.google.com/a/irri.org/file/d/0ByGk26Nk_MlAbTRIdVhVZDdKdjg/view,JA
