The black box of power in polycentric environmental governance,"Morrison, T.H.; Adger, W.N.; Brown, K.; Lemos, M.C.; Huitema, D.; Phelps, J.; Evans, L.; Cohen, P.J.; Song, A.M.; Turner, R.; Quinn, T.; Hughes, T.P.",James Cook University; University of Exeter; University of Michigan; VU University Amsterdam; Netherlands Open University; Lancaster University; WorldFish; University of Exeter,"Failure to address unsustainable global change is often attributed to failures in conventional environmental governance. Polycentric environmental governance—the popular alternative—involves many centres of authority interacting coherently for a common governance goal.

The baseline scenario depicts a setting where total fish production in 2035 is about 5.5 million tons or about two times its levels in 2012. As a result, per capita consumption of fish will be about 37 kg/person in 2035 or about 20% higher than in 2012. Fish exports and imports in 2035 are also expected to be more than two times as much as in 2012.

This paper developed five scenarios to explore futures of fish supply-demand in Bangladesh using the AsiaFish model, with special emphasis on the role of fish in macronutrient and micronutrient supply to address the nation's malnutrition and nutrition security challenges. A business-as-usual (BAU) scenario followed historical trends for exogenous variables used in the model. The four alternative scenarios explored: the implications of increase productivity of farmed tilapia, pangasius and rohu carp (AS1); improvements in the quality of feeds (AS2); disease outbreak in farmed shrimps and prawns (AS3); and climate change impacts (AS4). The BAU scenario indicates that aquaculture growth will be a prominent contribution to increasing total fish supply and demand and fish exports to 2040. Apart from the scenarios that are favourable to aquaculture sector development, other alternative scenarios highlighted the lower growth rate of capture fisheries and aquaculture compared to BAU, resulting in declining in per capita fish consumption, fish exports and nutrient supply from fish as a consequence. Increased availability of aquaculture fish can slightly compensate for the lower growth of capture fisheries in term of their nutrition quality and dietary diversity, particularly for poor consumers.

Technical efficiency of small-scale aquaculture in Myanmar: Does women’s participation in decision-making matter?,"Aung, Y.M.; Khor, L.; Tran, N.; Shikuku, K.M.; Zeller, M.",University of Hohenheim; Yezin Agricultural University; WorldFish,"Efficient use of inputs is crucial for sustainable aquaculture productivity growth, increased profitability, and improved livelihoods in developing countries. Studies have shown that women’s participation in decision-making (WPDM) can influence technical efficiency among agricultural crops farmers. However, rigorous empirical evidence in small-scale aquaculture is inadequate. Using data from 440 small-scale aquaculture households in the Ayeyarwady Delta region of Myanmar, this study: (a) measures technical efficiency using radial, non-radial and two-stage double bootstrap data envelopment analysis (DEA); and (b) examines the effect of WPDM on technical efficiency. Results reveal that most households perform 45–60% below the production frontier indicating they are not technically efficient. WPDM correlates with a significant increase in technical efficiency suggesting that women’s empowerment contributes to optimal use of inputs and improved on-farm aquaculture performance. Practicing polyculture and implementing climate change adaptation strategies correlate with enhanced efficiency. Practicing polyculture with compatible fish species allows advantageous interactions and coexistence which improve inputs utilization and reduce wastes. Judicious use of inputs as a strategy for addressing climatic shocks possibly explains the positive correlation between adaptation and technical efficiency. Together, the findings highlight the important need to promote interventions targeted at improving technical efficiency of small-scale aquaculture producers. Improving technical efficiency can reduce production costs, increase net farm income, and provide a sustainable supply of nutritious foods, a source of essential micronutrients such as vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids, and affordable animal-source protein.

Spatiotemporal determinants of seasonal gleaning,"Grantham, R.; Álvarez-Romero, J.G.; Mills, D.J.; Rojas, C.A.; Cumming, G.","James Cook University, ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; WorldFish; The Pontifical Catholic University of Chile","1. Many coastal communities depend on ecosystems for goods and services that contribute to human well-being. As long-standing interactions between people and nature are modified by global environmental change, dynamic and diversified livelihood strategies that enable seasonal adaptation will be critical for vulnerable coastal communities. However, the success of such strategies depends on a range of poorly understood influences.
2. Gleaning, the hand-based collection of marine organisms from littoral habitats, provides an interesting case study of dynamic change in social-ecological interactions. It is an important coastal livelihood strategy, yet seasonal gleaning dynamics have not been empirically explored in contemporary communities. We examined seasonal gleaning in eight coastal communities on Atauro Island, Timor-Leste, using household surveys and satellite-derived maps of shallow-water benthic habitats. Our analysis explored the factors affecting household decisions to glean in each season, the relationship between gleaning and seafood consumption, and seasonal gleaning pressure on near-shore coastal resources.
3. Dynamic marine harvesting strategies differed among households and gleaning activity was seasonally heterogeneous. Not all gleaning households gleaned during the season characterised by rough sea conditions despite rough season gleaning being associated with greater seafood consumption stability among seasons. Households also gleaned less regularly, and catches were smaller, in the rough season.
4. Differences in seasonal participation in gleaning were explained mostly by type and extent of shallow habitat proximate to a community. In the calm season, household gleaning was positively related to the total area of shallow habitat, and in the rough season the percentage of hard-bottom shallow habitat was also an important predictor of gleaning activity.
5. Our findings illustrate how changes in the biophysical environment mediate human–nature interactions at fine scales through time and space. Consequently, this research highlights the importance of context-specific perspectives for understanding drivers and dynamics in fishing pressure on littoral ecosystems, access to ecosystem benefits and limits to adaptation. Factors influencing when livelihood activities are feasible and desirable are important for evaluating the social impacts of climate change, particularly in the context of rural communities in the Global South.",2021,coastal; social-ecological systems; coral reef; Fish,ecosystem services; food security; livelihoods; small-scale fisheries,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12348/4940,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10179,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,Timor-Leste,South-Eastern Asia,en,"People and Nature;3,(2021) Pagination 376,390",Wiley Open Access,,Journal Article

We conclude that meeting current and larger consumption rates is feasible, despite a growing population and the impacts of climate change on potential fisheries production, but only if fish resources are managed sustainably and the animal feeds industry reduces its reliance on wild fish.

While biodiversity and the needs of local communities are often in congruence, the over-riding necessity of meeting national demands for power, food and, increasingly, mitigation of the hydrological effects of climate change, often supersedes these. Sophisticated models of ecosystem function to establish environmental flows are difficult to implement and consequently have generally failed to reduce rates of biodiversity and habitat loss, resulting in disenfranchisement of local communities resulting from dam construction and water abstraction for industry and agriculture. There are no agreed standards upon which a fairer allocation of resources can be made and thus a pragmatic approach to the resolution of these conflicts is clearly needed. While having generally negative impacts on biodiversity and traditional lifestyles, creation of new infrastructure and active management generates national economic growth and much-needed employment. Intensification of usage in watersheds already expropriated for human enterprise can spare land needed for the biodiversity that will fuel adaptation for the future. Taking advantage of a range of mitigation technologies and building their cost into the investment plans for water management infrastructure can improve the cost/benefit ratio of water control infrastructure and may be a more practical and efficacious approach to the valuation of fisheries and the maintenance of other essential services from functional aquatic ecosystems.",2013,,adaptation; agriculture; biodiversity; climate change; development; ecosystems; fisheries; water management; water power,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12348/858,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2012.00470.x,Limited access,,,,En,Fish and Fisheries,Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd,,Journal Article
Limits to resilience from livelihood diversification and social capital in lake social-ecological systems,"Goulden, M.C.; Adger, W.N.; Allison, E.; Conway, D.",University of East Anglia; University of Exeter; University of East Anglia,"Diversity of both social networks and livelihood sources plays a central role in determining the sustainability of natural resource use and resilience of social–ecological systems, not least in resource-dependent economies. Yet the types of social capital and characteristics of diversity are not well understood. Here we examine social capital and livelihood diversification strategies in dynamic lakeshore social–ecological systems in Uganda adapting to climate variability and change. Water and land use data are used to explain lake system variations and lakeshore people's livelihood responses in terms of adaptive cycles and examine how system resilience changes over time in response to climatic and other stresses. Interview and household survey data are used to explain household adaptations to climate variability based on livelihood diversification and social capital and to determine which adaptations were dominant during different stages of adaptive cycles. Results show that households adapt to climate variability using concurrent, spatial, and temporal diversification of livelihoods and by drawing on social capital, but these sources of resilience are not sufficient in all circumstances. The availability of adaptation options varies according to the different stages in the adaptive cycle of the lakeshore's dynamic, coupled human–ecological system; to the degree and nature of the climatic stress; and to differences in household access to assets and adaptation options.

With the refinement and downscaling of global climate models and increasing availability of airborne-lidar-based inundation models, it is possible to predict and quantify these threats with reasonable accuracy where such information is available. For less developed countries, especially small island states, access to high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from lidar is limited. The only freely available DEMs that could be used for inundation modeling by these nations are those based on data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM).

The global food system is responsible for ~1/3 of GHG emissions and thus plays an important role in reaching emission targets. Consumers, technology innovation, industry, and agricultural practices offer various degrees of opportunity to reduce emissions and remove CO2. However, a question remains as to whether food system transformation can achieve net negative emissions (i.e., where GHG sinks exceed sources sector wide) and what the capacity of the different levers may be. We use a global food system model to explore the influence of consumer choice, climate-smart agro-industrial technologies, and food waste reductions for achieving net negative emissions for the year 2050. We analyze an array of scenarios under the conditions of full yield gap closures and caloric demands in a world with 10 billion people. Our results reveal a high-end capacity of 33 gigatonnes of net negative emissions per annum via complete food system transformation, which assumes full global deployment of behavioral-, management- and technology-based interventions. The most promising technologies for achieving net negative emissions include hydrogen-powered fertilizer production, livestock feeds, organic and inorganic soil amendments, agroforestry, and sustainable seafood harvesting practices. On the consumer side, adopting flexitarian diets cannot achieve full decarbonization of the food system but has the potential to increase the magnitude of net negative emissions when combined with technology scale-up. GHG reductions ascribed to a mixture of technology deployment and dietary shifts emerge for many different countries, with areas of high ruminant production and non-intensive agricultural systems showing the greatest per capita benefits. This analysis highlights potential for future food systems to achieve net negative emissions using multifaceted “cradle-to-grave” and “land-to-sea” emission reduction strategies that embrace emerging climate-smart agro-industrial technologies.",2023,climate scenarios,models; food systems; greenhouse gas emissions,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12348/5759,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000181,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,,,en,PLOS Climate;(2023),Public Library of Science,"World Wildlife Fund; University of California-Santa Barbara, National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis; Rockefeller Foundation; Wellcome Trust",Journal Article
Food security versus environment conservation: A case study of Solomon Islands' small-scale fisheries,"Hardy, P.Y.; Bene, C.; Doyen, L.; Schwarz, A.M.",CNRS-MNHN; University of Sussex; WorldFish,"The sustainable management of small-scale fisheries in coral reef ecosystems constitutes a difficult objective not least because these fisheries usually face several worsening pressures, including demographic growth and climate change. The implications are crucial in terms of food security as fish represents the major protein source for local populations in many regions reliant on small-scale fisheries. The case of the Solomon Islands’ fishery presented in this paper represents an illustrative example of these issues. The paper proposes a bio-economic model based on the local fishery that accounts for multi-species and multi-fleet dynamics and integrates calibrated Lotka–Volterra trophic dynamics. Several contrasting fishing scenarios are tested and their results compared using two biological indicators (Simpson index and species richness) and two socio-economic indicators (fish consumption and cash income).

In order to address scarcity and improve water use efficiency for rural farmers, fish farming is being integrated with small-scale irrigation. However, there are challenges in how to allocate water between the two farming enterprises. This study explored the capabilities of system dynamics to allocate water between a fish pond and a crop field in Chingale, Malawi using a system dynamic software, Vensim™ PLE. For soil water and pond water, a simple water balance structure was built and connected to the crop growth structure. Simulations run for 125 days corresponding to the maize growth period. Model results are similar to the actual yield (about 3.5 ton/ha for hybrid) and biomass production (about 7 ton/ha) in the area. Results also show it was possible to maintain pond water depth at recommended depths for raising fish: fish stocking (1 m), operation of the pond (1.5–2.0 m) and harvesting of the fish (less than 1.2 m) throughout the maize growing period. While the study did not comprehensively build and simulate fish growth, the use of such simple tools would benefit rural farmers with few resources.

The material dimension is dominated by concerns with cost and competitiveness, whereas for the procedural dimension issues of skills and compliance arise, and for the informational dimension, key issues are trust, reliability and persuasiveness. A secondary classification into ten types of practices identified additional associations with adaptation mechanisms, for instance, technical practices are followed and adjusted to reduce and manage risks, while many infrastructural and technological practices aim to control rearing environments. Innovation has been driven more by concerns with increasing productivity, disease control, and food safety than extreme weather events and climate change.

In lowland rice field landscapes of Cambodia, community fish refuges (CFRs) are used to maintain fish abundance and biodiversity, with varying success.

We used beta diversity to explore the effectiveness of 40 CFRs in maintaining species abundance and diversity during the dry seasons from 2012 to 2015. Results show CFR connectivity to the floodplain is important and suggest the type of inlet/outlet influences fish retention. CFRs connected to a large area of rice fields during the wet season had lower losses in species abundance through the dry season. However, large CFRs, or those part of a larger body of water, had higher losses in species abundance.

Despite this, the sustainability of global fisheries is a growing concern, and the factors enabling or constraining the sustainable management of small-scale fisheries remain poorly understood. Hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) is the single most valuable species harvested in Bangladesh waters, serves nutrition, income, and employment to the large population. This study analyzed the state and challenges of hilsa fishery in the Gangetic River systems (Padma and Meghna Rivers) by using two frameworks, namely the social-ecological systems (SES) and drivers-pressure-state-impact-responses (DPSIR) frameworks. Primary data for this analysis were collected by in-depth interviews (n=130) and focus group discussions (n=8) with various stakeholders in the hilsa fisheries. The perspectives explored here have been both critical and constructive, including the identification of problems and suggestions for improving the management of this particular social-ecological system. Hilsa fisheries, however, have come under severe threat since 2003 because of population growth, overfishing, pollution, climate change, the disruption of migration routes due to siltation, etc. All these have caused reduced catches and less stable incomes for fishers. This, in turn, has led to poverty, malnutrition, social tensions, stakeholder conflicts, and debt cycles amongst more impoverished fishing communities. These problems have been compounded by improved fishing technology amongst larger-scale ventures, the use of illegal fishing gears, and the non-compliance of government fishery management programs. Recommendations include the promotion of community-supported fisheries, the enhancement of stakeholder’s social resilience, the introduction of co-management approach, an increase in incentives and formal financial supports, and possible community-managed sustainable ecotourism including hilsa fishing-based tourism.",2019,sustainable management; hilsa fishery; social-ecological systems (ses); dpsir,impacts; small-scale fisheries; social resilience,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12348/3877,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16234814,Open access,CC-BY-4.0,Bangladesh,Southern Asia,en,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;(2019),MDPI,United States Agency for International Development,Journal Article

We analyse their vulnerability and adaptive capacity in the face of expected changes in rainfall combined with the predicted effects of dam construction. Data from the Inner Niger Delta in Mali were used to show that fishers were highly sensitive to past and recent variations in the hydro-climatic conditions. Moreover, it appears their traditional livelihood strategies, although diversified, sophisticated and well suited to historical conditions, offer a limited set of options to adapt to increased environmental constraints. For fish-dependent households that have adopted a mixed set of activities through farming, the high seasonality and constraints characterizing both their main activities (fishing and farming) does not allow switching between activities. For those households that undertake seasonal fishing migrations, there is little opportunity to modify migration routes or find new settlements sites inside the delta because of the high population density in this area. In sum, although the adoption of diversified and spatially discrete patterns in livelihood activities is often presented as a strategy to reduce vulnerability, such a strategy does not appear sufficient to allow fishers of the delta to successfully face the increasing constraints associated with the changes in hydro-climatic conditions. In such a context, fishing communities will be driven towards more drastic strategies of adaptation and/or coping such as switching to new activities based on agricultural innovations or emigration from the delta.

Food security and the coral Triangle Initiative,"Foale, S.; Adhuri, D.S.; Aliño, P.; Allison, E.; Andrew, N.L.; Cohen, P.J.; Evans, L.; Fabinyi, M.; Fidelman, P.; Gregory, C.; Stacey, N.; Tanzer, J.; Weeratunge, N.",James Cook University; WorldFish; University of the Philippines; University of the Sunshine Coast; Australian National University; Charles Darwin University; Global Marine Programme,"The Asia-Pacific's Coral Triangle is defined by its extremely high marine biodiversity. Over one hundred million people living in its coastal zones use this biodiversity to support their livelihoods. Hundreds of millions more derive nutritious food directly from the region's marine resources and through local, regional and global trade. Biodiversity and its values to society are threatened by demographic and habitat change, rising demand, intensive harvesting and climate change. In partnership with international conservation organisations and development funders, the governments of the region's six countries have come together to develop the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security. The CTI has explicit goals and defined targets for marine biodiversity conservation, but not for the food security of the region's marine-resource dependent people, despite this being the wider aim used to justify conservation action. This article suggests how the food security aim of the CTI could be made more explicit. It outlines the complex pathways linking marine biodiversity with food security and argues that improved social science analysis, inter-sectoral policy and management interactions are necessary if conserving marine biodiversity is to contribute towards meeting food security challenges in the region.",2013,,biodiversity; climate change; coral reefs; ecosystems; food security; livelihoods; marine fisheries,https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12348/815,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2012.05.033,Limited access,,,,En,Marine Policy,Elsevier Ltd,,Journal Article
