1131,INIT-30,Initiative output,Innovation development,Extended version of the Global Food System Sustainability Index:  a policy relevant tool that can help decision-makers design policies that are more effective,"The original Global Food System Sustainability Index (GFSSI) considered four dimensions of food system sustainability (food security & nutrition, environment, economic and social dimensions) and covered 97 countries from low, middle and high-income regions. One limitation of this index, however, was that the four dimensions were not equally represented, with both the economic and social dimensions depending on a limited number of indicators. In the 2022 paper, CGIAR researchers from Sustainable Healthy Diets and their co-author built an extended version of the GFSSI by adding several indicators to the two dimensions where the representativity was weak: the social and economic dimensions. They used the extended GFSSI to investigate whether all four dimensions contribute equally to the change observed in the sustainability of food systems across countries, or whether some dimensions are more important than others, and if so, which dimension(s) and for which (group of) countries.",NA,(0) Not targeted,(2) Principal,NA,0,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,CIAT (Alliance),NA,• [INIT-30] (4) Stakeholders improve the design and implementation of the national roadmap towards food systems transformation for sustainable healthy diets.,• Systems Transformation,"• Climate Adaptation and Mitigation

In this paper, we propose to address this gap by computing a global food system sustainability index which we then use in a cross-country analysis covering 94 countries in low-, middle- and high-income regions. The analysis reveals a strong non-linear but positive correlation between the food system sustainability index and countries’ individual GDP per capita. This relationship suggests some possible degree of endogeneity between food system sustainability and economic development. We then use the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways framework and Individual Conditional Expectations modeling techniques to explore how the sustainability of food systems is projected to evolve in the future as countries move up the economic development ladder.

1210,INIT-01,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Rice Chalky Grain 5 regulates natural variation for grain quality under heat stress,"Heat stress occurring during rice (Oryza sativa) grain development reduces grain quality, which often manifests as increased grain chalkiness. Although the impact of heat stress on grain yield is well-studied, the genetic basis of rice grain quality under heat stress is less explored as quantifying grain quality is less tractable than grain yield. To address this, we used an image-based colorimetric assay (Red, R; and Green, G) for genome-wide association analysis to identify genetic loci underlying the phenotypic variation in rice grains exposed to heat stress. We found the R to G pixel ratio (RG) derived from mature grain images to be effective in distinguishing chalky grains from translucent grains derived from control (28/24°C) and heat stressed (36/32°C) plants. Our analysis yielded a novel gene, rice Chalky Grain 5 (OsCG5) that regulates natural variation for grain chalkiness under heat stress. OsCG5 encodes a grain-specific, expressed protein of unknown function. Accessions with lower transcript abundance of OsCG5 exhibit higher chalkiness, which correlates with higher RG values under stress. These findings are supported by increased chalkiness of OsCG5 knock-out (KO) mutants relative to wildtype (WT) under heat stress. Grains from plants overexpressing OsCG5 are less chalky than KOs but comparable to WT under heat stress. Compared to WT and OE, KO mutants exhibit greater heat sensitivity for grain size and weight relative to controls. Collectively, these results show that the natural variation at OsCG5 may contribute towards rice grain quality under heat stress.","Hussain, Waseem (IRRI) <waseem.hussain@irri.org>",(1) Significant,(2) Principal,NA,0,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,IRRI,NA,"• [INIT-01] Elite donor lines carrying highly valuable, in-demand traits",• Genetic Innovation,"• Climate Adaptation and Mitigation

A set of >200 rice accessions from Southeast Asia (a subset of the 3000 Rice Genomes Project) was characterized with the aim to identify root morphological and anatomical phenotypes related to productivity under drought stress. Drought stress resulted in slight increases in the basal metaxylem and stele diameter of nodal roots. Although few direct correlations between root phenotypes and grain yield were identified, biomass was consistently positively correlated with crown root number and negatively correlated with stele diameter. The accessions with highest grain yield were characterized by higher crown root numbers and median metaxylem diameter and smaller stele diameter. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed 162 and 210 significant SNPs associated with root phenotypes in the two seasons which resulted in identification of 59 candidate genes related to root development. The gene OsRSL3 was found in a QTL region for median metaxylem diameter. Four SNPs in OsRSL3 were found that caused amino acid changes and significantly associated with the root phenotype. Based on the haplotype analysis for median metaxylem diameter, the rice accessions studied were classified into five allele combinations in order to identify the most favorable haplotypes.

In a semi-automatic root phenotyping facility (lysimetric system) a set of 100 elite and diverse tropical maize inbred lines were phenotyped under managed drought stress (DT) and well-watered (WW) conditions. Plants were grown in PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) cylinder of 30.0 cm diameter and 150.0 cm length. In drought experiment, last irrigation was applied based accumulated growing degree days (∑GDD) criteria to achieved reproductive stress DT, whereas optimal moisture was maintained in WW trials. Data recorded on various root structural and function traits in both DT and WW trials. Significant phenotypic variability was observed for various root traits, including both structural and functional traits, under both the moisture regimes. Correlation studies showed that grain yield of early maturity group of genotypes was positively and significantly associated with all the root structural traits under drought, whereas, in case of medium and late maturity group of entries root structural traits showed either weak positive or significant negative correlation with grain yield under drought. Though, root functional traits of all the maturity group of genotypes showed positive and significant correlations with both grain yield and total biomass under both well-watered drought stress. Regression analysis showed that water uptake had significant positive relationship with total biomass in all the three-maturity group of genotypes. However, grain yield seems to be less dependent directly on the total amount of water uptake. We conclude that contribution of various traits in root system architecture under drought or well-watered conditions vary with maturity of genotypes.

Saline lands result in low agricultural productivity, affecting the well-being of farmers and the economic situation in the region. The prediction of soil salinization dynamics plays a crucial role in sustainable development of agricultural regions, in preserving the ecosystems, and in improving irrigation management practices. Accurate information through monitoring and evaluating the changes in soil salinity is essential for the development of strategies for agriculture productivity and efficient soil management. As part of an ex-ante analysis, we presented a comprehensive statistical framework for predicting soil salinity dynamics using the Homogeneity test and linear regression model. The framework was operationalized in the context of the Khorezm region of Uzbekistan, which suffers from high levels of soil salinity. The soil salinity trends and levels were projected under the impact of climate change from 2021 to 2050 and 2051 to 2100. The results show that the slightly saline soils would generally decrease (from 55.4% in 2050 to 52.4% by 2100 based on the homogeneity test; from 55.9% in 2050 to 54.5% by 2100 according to the linear regression model), but moderately saline soils would increase (from 31.2% in 2050 to 32.5% by 2100 based on the homogeneity test; from 31.2% in 2050 to 32.4% by 2100 according to the linear regression model). Moreover, highly saline soils would increase (from 13.4% in 2050 to 15.1% by 2100 based on the homogeneity test; from 12.9% in 2050 to 13.1% by 2100 according to the linear regression model).

As part of an ex-ante analysis, we presented a comprehensive statistical framework for predicting soil salinity dynamics using the Homogeneity test and linear regression model. The framework was operationalized in the context of the Khorezm region of Uzbekistan, which suffers from high levels of soil salinity. The soil salinity trends and levels were projected under the impact of climate change from 2021 to 2050 and 2051 to 2100. The results show that the slightly saline soils would generally decrease (from 55.4% in 2050 to 52.4% by 2100 based on the homogeneity test; from 55.9% in 2050 to 54.5% by 2100 according to the linear regression model), but moderately saline soils would increase (from 31.2% in 2050 to 32.5% by 2100 based on the homogeneity test; from 31.2% in 2050 to 32.4% by 2100 according to the linear regression model). Moreover, highly saline soils would increase (from 13.4% in 2050 to 15.1% by 2100 based on the homogeneity test; from 12.9% in 2050 to 13.1% by 2100 according to the linear regression model). The results of this study provide an understanding that soil salinity depends on climate change and help the government to better plan future management strategies for the region."
1246,INIT-34,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Limitations of using simple indicators for evaluating agricultural emission reductions at farm level — evidence from Kenyan smallholder dairy production,"National-scale carbon footprints of livestock production are commonly computed from a set of production system

characteristics that serve as inputs for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission models. We evaluated the feasibility of

using such equations at a finer scale to derive a simple farm-scale indicator of emission intensity (milk yield per

head). Using probabilistic simulations, we quantified the impact of input variable uncertainty on emission estimates

for smallholder dairy farms in Kenya. We simulated emissions for farm-scale scenarios generated from a survey of

414 households and published or expert-estimated uncertainty bounds. We simulated the impacts of five

interventions: changing breeds, retiring unproductive males, keeping fewer replacement males, feeding forage

supplements, and balancing animal diets. Impacts were assessed against a true counterfactual and against a more

realistic scenario affected by random effects. We estimated errors incurred in classifying farms into adopters and

non-adopters of the innovations based on changes in milk yield per animal. Given the current uncertainty, such

classification would either miss a large percentage of adopters or misclassify many non-adopters as adopters. As a

critical uncertainty, we identified the milk yield of dairy cows. Added precision on this metric reduced but did not

eliminate classification errors. We remain cautiously optimistic about using milk yield per head to proxy emission

intensity, but its effective use will require further reduction of critical uncertainties. Replacing generic

recommendations of parameter uncertainties with context-specific error estimates might lead to a more efficient quantification of the carbon footprint of milk production on smallholder farms.",Todd Rosenstock,(0) Not targeted,(2) Principal,NA,0,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,Bioversity (Alliance),ICRAF,• [INIT-34] Livestock project MRV tools,• Resilient Agrifood Systems,"• Climate Adaptation and Mitigation

Despite rapidly intensifying climate change in recent years, a knowledge gap persists as to how climate change may affect women’s VABH in developing countries. This has been particularly challenging in countries like India, which host one of the largest numbers of the poor and has been increasingly plagued by droughts, floods, cyclones, rising temperatures, and increasing rainfall fluctuations. This study provides a conceptual discussion on the linkages between climate change and VABH and analyzes their empirical relationship using multiple rounds of nationwide household data from India (India Human Development Survey 2005, 2012; World Values Survey 2001, 2006, 2012); climate data; and data on women’s political representation at the district level. Our results suggest that in rural parts of India, adverse climate change and natural disasters, such as cyclones and/or floods, have consistently negative associations with a broad range of VABH-related outcomes. Moreover, in rural areas, greater political representation by women in district assemblies broadly mitigates the potential effects of adverse climate change on VABH-related outcomes. These patterns generally hold across various populations, differentiated by marriage status and age groups, and are more robust in rural compared to urban areas. There are also generally consistent gender differences in these associations. Specifically, results indicate that women’s VABH are disproportionately more negatively affected by adverse CC than men’s VABH, while greater female representation at local district assemblies has greater effects in mitigating adverse CC on VABH among women than men.

Given that women are vulnerable to climate change in unique ways and have important contributions to increase the climate resilience of the agri-food sector, it is imperative for governments to design and enact policies to enhance women’s resilience to climate change by alleviating gendered constraints and building women’s resilience capacities in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The SDGs provide a goalpost for strengthening women’s voice and agency in climate resilience. In particular, SDG 5.5 which “seeks to ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities, defined as meaningful involvement and exertion of influence, for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life.” Improving women’s full, effective, and meaningful participation in the policy process is a critical pre-condition to increasing women’s resilience to climate change and disaster risk. As such, one of the central conclusions of the 65th Commission on the Status of Women (CSW65) reaffirmed the need for government policies to champion women’s full and effective participation and leadership in climate change governance. The review emphasizes government policies that promote women’s agency and voices in climate change resilience at multiple scales; national frameworks for integrating gender in climate policy, and women’s resilience capacities in the agri-food sector.

Given that women are vulnerable to climate change in unique ways and have important contributions to increase the climate resilience of the agri-food sector, it is imperative for governments to design and enact policies to enhance women’s resilience to climate change by alleviating gendered constraints and building women’s resilience capacities in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The SDGs provide a goalpost for strengthening women’s voice and agency in climate resilience. In particular, SDG 5.5 which “seeks to ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities, defined as meaningful involvement and exertion of influence, for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life.” Improving women’s full, effective, and meaningful participation in the policy process is a critical pre-condition to increasing women’s resilience to climate change and disaster risk. As such, one of the central conclusions of the 65th Commission on the Status of Women (CSW65) reaffirmed the need for government policies to champion women’s full and effective participation and leadership in climate change governance. The review emphasizes government policies that promote women’s agency and voices in climate change resilience at multiple scales; national frameworks for integrating gender in climate policy, and women’s resilience capacities in the agri-food sector. Importantly, and when data allows, the review also details how and under what conditions these policies succeed in enabling women to acquire voice and agency in climate change resilience through specific well-being outcomes."

Detailed interviews are conducted in the districts of Bavel and Thma Koul. We first analyse farmer respondents’ socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, climate change perceptions and experience, risk attitudes, and awareness of insurance. The binary logistic model is used to identify factors that significantly impact farmers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for WII. Our results show that farmers in general had lower awareness of how to use innovative financial products to adapt to extreme weather. The results also demonstrate that farmer respondents’ marital status, the number of off-farm labourers, and the farm size have a positive effect, whereas the number of children in the household has a negative effect on farmers’ WTP for WII. Specifically, being married, an increase of one off-farm labourer, and an increase of one hectare (ha) of farmland increase the probability of demand for WII by 38.6%, 21.4%, and 5.1%, respectively. In contrast, an increase of one child reduces the probability of WII demand by 9.7%.

146,INIT-32,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Greenhouse gas mitigation potential of Alternate Wetting and Drying for rice production at national scale - A modeling case study for the Philippines,"Worldwide, rice production contributes about 10% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the agricultural sector, mainly due to CH4 emissions from continuously flooded fields. Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) is a promising crop technology for mitigating CH4 emissions and reducing the irrigation water currently being applied in many of the world's top rice-producing countries. However, decreased emissions of CH4 may be partially counterbalanced by increased N2O emissions. In this case study for the Philippines, the national mitigation potential of AWD is explored using the process-based biogeochemical model LandscapeDNDC. Simulated mean annual CH4 emissions under conventional rice production for the time period 2000–2011 are estimated as 1,180 ± 163 Gg CH4 yr−1.

Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) is a promising crop technology for mitigating CH4 emissions and reducing the irrigation water currently being applied in many of the world's top rice-producing countries. However, decreased emissions of CH4 may be partially counterbalanced by increased N2O emissions. In this case study for the Philippines, the national mitigation potential of AWD is explored using the process-based biogeochemical model LandscapeDNDC. Simulated mean annual CH4 emissions under conventional rice production for the time period 2000–2011 are estimated as 1,180 ± 163 Gg CH4 yr−1. During the cropping season, this is about +16% higher than a former estimate using emission factors.

However, the available experimental data suggest that in many cases most emissions are concentrated in the first months following N application. Therefore resources could be better deployed by measuring more intensively during a shorter period. This study aimed to assess the contribution of the N2O flux in the period directly after N application to the annual net emission. We used a database of 100 year-long plot experiments from different excreted-N sources (dung, urine, farmyard manure and slurry) used to derive EFs for the UK and Ireland. We explored different shorter potential measurement periods that could be used as proxies for cumulative annual emissions. The analysis showed that the majority of emissions occur in the first months after application, especially in experiments that i) had urine as the N source, ii) had spring N application, iii) were conducted on fine-textured soils, or iv) showed high annual emissions magnitude. Experiments that showed a smaller percentage of emissions in the first months also had a low magnitude of annual net emissions (below 370 gN2O–N ha−1 year−1), so the impact of measuring during a shorter period would not greatly influence the calculated EF.

1569,INIT-32,Initiative output,Knowledge product,A simplified approach for producing Tier 2 enteric-methane emission factors based on East African smallholder farm data,"Context. 

Accurate reporting of livestock greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is important in developing effective mitigation strategies, but the cost and labour requirements associated with on-farm data collection often prevent this effort in low- and middle-income countries. 



Aim. 

The aim of this study was to investigate the precision and accuracy of simplified activity data collection protocols in African smallholder livestock farms for country-specific enteric-methane emission factors. 



Method. 

Activity data such as live weight (LW), feed quality, milk yield, and milk composition were collected from 257 smallholder farms, with a total herd of 1035 heads of cattle in Nandi and Bomet counties in western Kenya. The data collection protocol was then altered by substituting the actual LW measurements with algorithm LW (ALG), feed quality (FQ) data being sourced from the Feedipedia database, reducing the need for daily milk yield records to a single seasonal milk measurement (MiY), and by using a default energy content of milk (MiE). Daily methane production (DMP) was calculated using these simplified protocols and the estimates under individual and combined protocols were compared with values derived from the published (PUBL) estimation protocol. 



Key results. 

Employing the algorithm LW showed good agreement in DMP, with only a small negative bias (7%) and almost no change in variance. Calculating DMP on the basis of Feedipedia FQ, by contrast, resulted in a 27% increase in variation and a 27% positive bias for DMP compared with PUBL. The substitutions of milk (MiY and MiE) showed a modest change in variance and almost no bias in DMP. 



Conclusion. 

It is feasible to use a simplified data collection protocol by using algorithm LW, the default energy content of milk value, and seasonal single milk yield data, but full sampling and analysis of feed resources are required to produce reliable Tier 2 enteric-methane emission factors. 



Implications. 

Reducing enteric methane emissions from livestock is a promising pathway to reduce the effects of climate change, and, hence, the need to produce accurate emission estimates as a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of mitigation options. However, it is expensive to produce accurate emission estimates, especially in developing countries; hence, it is important and feasible to simplify on-farm data collection.",Phyllis Ndungu,(0) Not targeted,(2) Principal,NA,0,NA,No,NA,INIT-34,NA,ILRI,NA,"• [INIT-32] 2.3  More robust GHG emission and mitigation data

Ruminant production also releases nitrogen to the environment, resulting in groundwater pollution and emissions of greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. We hypothesized that inhibiting rumen methanogenesis in dairy cows with chemical inhibitor 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) would redirect metabolic hydrogen towards synthesis of microbial amino acids. Our objective was to investigate the effects of 3-NOP on methane emissions, rumen fermentation and nitrogen metabolism of dairy cows fed true protein or urea as nitrogen sources. Eight ruminally-cannulated cows were fed a plant protein or a urea-containing diet during a Control experimental period followed by a methanogenesis inhibition period with 3-NOP supplementation. All diets were unintentionally deficient in nitrogen, and diets supplemented with 3-NOP had higher fiber than diets fed in the Control period. Higher dietary fiber content in the 3-NOP period would be expected to cause higher methane emissions; however, methane emissions adjusted by dry matter and digested organic matter intake were 54% lower with 3-NOP supplementation. Also, despite of the more fibrous diet, 3-NOP shifted rumen fermentation from acetate to propionate. The post-feeding rumen ammonium peak was substantially lower in the 3-NOP period, although that did not translate into greater rumen microbial protein production nor lesser nitrogen excretion in urine. Presumably, because all diets resulted in low rumen ammonium, and intake of digestible organic matter was lower in the 3-NOP period compared to the Control period, the synthesis of microbial amino acids was limited by nitrogen and energy, precluding the evaluation of our hypothesis.

Conservation Agriculture (CA) systems can be effective in mitigating yield loss in environments with increased weather risk. This study aimed to evaluate CA cropping systems that can minimize both economic and climatic risks under erratic climatic conditions in West Africa. We tested upland rice-based CA systems and conventional systems with tillage (CT), in rotation with maize in some of the cases, without and with fertilization, at different sowing windows in the Bouaké region, Côte d’Ivoire, from 2015 to 2020. Sowing in June showed in a higher rice yield (1183 kg ha-1 and 1370 kg ha-1 without and with fertilization, on average over the 2017–2020 period) than in March (521 kg ha-1 and 495 kg ha-1 without and with fertilization) or in July or August (335 kg ha-1 and 498 kg ha-1 without and with fertilization). During the first four years, rice yields tended to be lower under the CA systems than under the CT systems, especially when water availability was not a major constraint. However, after this transition period, and especially when water stress occurred, as in 2020, rice yields under CA systems (1835–2021 and 2147–2254 kg ha-1 without and with fertilization) were higher than under CT systems (1350 kg ha-1 and 1435 kg ha-1 without and with fertilization). CA systems having relatively longer duration for growing cover crops tended to produce higher upland rice yield grown in the subsequent season. In both CT and CA systems, the impact of fertilization on rice yield was small over the study period, and the mean rice yield increase due to fertilization was on average 451 kg ha-1 even when rice was sown in the summer season, resulting in negative economic return. These results indicate that whereas low-input CA upland rice-based systems together with optimizing sowing window for rice could be promising options for sustaining rice yield and mitigating yield loss in environments with increased weather risk, further research is needed for reducing transition period to CA systems in order to enhance their adoption by smallholder farmers. Desirable cover crops should be less labor-demanding, generate incomes from their products, and produce large biomass under erratic climatic conditions.",Kazuki Saito,(0) Not targeted,(2) Principal,NA,0,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,AfricaRice,NA,• [INIT-11] 3.2: Portfolio of innovation solutions,• Resilient Agrifood Systems,"• Climate Adaptation and Mitigation

Conservation Agriculture (CA) systems can be effective in mitigating yield loss in environments with increased weather risk. This study aimed to evaluate CA cropping systems that can minimize both economic and climatic risks under erratic climatic conditions in West Africa. We tested upland rice-based CA systems and conventional systems with tillage (CT), in rotation with maize in some of the cases, without and with fertilization, at different sowing windows in the Bouaké region, Côte d’Ivoire, from 2015 to 2020. Sowing in June showed in a higher rice yield (1183 kg ha-1 and 1370 kg ha-1 without and with fertilization, on average over the 2017–2020 period) than in March (521 kg ha-1 and 495 kg ha-1 without and with fertilization) or in July or August (335 kg ha-1 and 498 kg ha-1 without and with fertilization). During the first four years, rice yields tended to be lower under the CA systems than under the CT systems, especially when water availability was not a major constraint. However, after this transition period, and especially when water stress occurred, as in 2020, rice yields under CA systems (1835–2021 and 2147–2254 kg ha-1 without and with fertilization) were higher than under CT systems (1350 kg ha-1 and 1435 kg ha-1 without and with fertilization). CA systems having relatively longer duration for growing cover crops tended to produce higher upland rice yield grown in the subsequent season. In both CT and CA systems, the impact of fertilization on rice yield was small over the study period, and the mean rice yield increase due to fertilization was on average 451 kg ha-1 even when rice was sown in the summer season, resulting in negative economic return. These results indicate that whereas low-input CA upland rice-based systems together with optimizing sowing window for rice could be promising options for sustaining rice yield and mitigating yield loss in environments with increased weather risk, further research is needed for reducing transition period to CA systems in order to enhance their adoption by smallholder farmers. Desirable cover crops should be less labor-demanding, generate incomes from their products, and produce large biomass under erratic climatic conditions."

Spot blotch and terminal heat stress are the two significant constraints mainly in the Indo–Gangetic plains of South Asia. The study was undertaken using 185 recombinant lines (RILs) derived from the interspecific hybridization of ‘Triticum aestivum (HUW234) × T. spelta (H+26)’ to reveal genomic regions associated with tolerance to combined stress to spot blotch and terminal heat. Different physiological (NDVI, canopy temperature, leaf chlorophyll) and grain traits (TGW, grain size) were observed under stressed (spot blotch, terminal heat) and non-stressed environments. The mean maturity duration of RILs under combined stress was reduced by 12 days, whereas the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was 46.03%. Similarly, the grain size was depleted under combined stress by 32.23% and thousand kernel weight (TKW) by 27.56% due to spot blotch and terminal heat stress, respectively. The genetic analysis using 6734 SNP markers identified 37 significant loci for the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) and NDVI.

1667,INIT-11,Initiative output,Knowledge product,A data-mining approach for developing site-specific fertilizer response functions across the wheat-growing environments in Ethiopia,"The use of chemical fertilizers is among the main innovations brought by the 1960s Green Revolution. In Ethiopia, fertilizer application during the last four decades has led to significant yield gains, yet yield remains below its potential across much of the country. One of the main challenges responsible for low yield response to fertilizer application has been the use of ‘blanket’ recommendations, whereby no tailoring of fertilizer amount and frequency is done based on soil requirements. As a result, the amount of fertilizer applied ranges widely, and can be either sub- or supra-optimal. There is thus an increasing need for site-specific fertilizer recommendations which take into account site characteristics such as climate variables (temperature, rainfall, and solar radiation); soil factors (soil organic carbon, moisture, pH, texture, cation exchange capacity, and level of macro- and micronutrients); and topographic position indices. This article reports on a data-mining approach we developed on a large dataset of 6585 wheat (Triticum aestivum) field trials. The dataset includes detailed, site-specific biophysical variables to create nutrient response functions that can guide optimal site-specific fertilizer application. The approach used a machine-learning model (random forest) to capture the relationship between nutrients – nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), and sulfur (S) – and wheat yield. The model explained about 83, 82, 47, and 69% of variances of yield for N, P, K, and S omission, respectively, with consistent performance across training and testing datasets. Expectedly, for N and P omission data, the most important explanatory variables are nutrient rate, followed by soil organic carbon and soil pH. For K and S, however, climatic variables played an important role alongside nutrient rates. The site-specific yield–fertilizer response curves derived from our model are highly variable from location to location, as they are affected by the climatic, soil, or topographic conditions of the site. Importantly, using principal component analysis, we showed that the shape of the fertilizer response curves is a result of the multiple environmental factors (including soil, topography, and climate) that are at play at a given site, rather than of a specific dominant one. The research output is expected to respond to the national policy demands for a sound method to identify the optimal fertilizer rate to increase economic returns of fertilizer investments and take fertilizer utilization research one step further.",Wuletawu Abera,(1) Significant,(2) Principal,NA,1,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,Bioversity (Alliance),"CIAT (Alliance), ICRISAT",• [INIT-11] 1.2: Deployment-ready Minimum Viable Products (MVPs),• Resilient Agrifood Systems,"• Climate Adaptation and Mitigation

However, with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, the central role of researchers in participatory research processes had to be questioned and revisited. New modes of PAR developed dynamically under the new circumstances created by the pandemic. To better understand how Covid-19 changed the way PAR is applied, we analyzed PAR in agricultural research for development carried out in the Programme for Climate-Smart Livestock Systems (PCSL) implemented by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) at five research sites in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Uganda. To understand how PAR changed in a component on adaptation research in the PCSL we facilitated a reflexive study with livestock keepers and researchers to document their experiences of PAR during the Covid-19 pandemic. The analytical framework focuses on highlighting the core characteristics and the underlying ethos of PAR in this case study. The lessons learnt in the process of adapting to the realities of doing participatory research in the middle of a pandemic provide important arguments for further amalgamating the PAR philosophy into similar research designs. The onset of the pandemic has led to a further decentering of the researcher and a shift of the focus to the citizen, in this case the local livestock keeper, that made it more participatory in the stricter interpretation of the term. Letting go of controlling both narrative and implementation of the research will be challenging for researchers in many research fields. However, this shift of power and this transformation of research methodologies is inevitable if the research should remain relevant and impactful. Ultimately, the transition into a Covid-19 future and the awareness that similar pandemics could dramatically interrupt our lives any time, will have an impact on how projects are designed and funded. More long-term funding and less pressure on providing immediate results can build community trust and ownership for research at a local level."

1762,INIT-34,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Soil carbon stocks and nitrous oxide emissions of pasture systems in Orinoquía region of Colombia: Potential for developing land-based greenhouse gas removal projects,"Improving grassland conditions under grazing has the potential not only to accumulate carbon in soils, but also to reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from animal urine deposition. However, measurements in developing countries are still scarce. In the Orinoquia region, permanent grasslands (PG; this unimproved, native pasture is considered as at some state of degradation) based on unimproved grasses are found due to extensive, inefficient grazing combined with annual burning of pastures. We hypothesized that, compared to PG, improved grasslands (IG) managed through rotational grazing of introduced, productive and deep-rooted pasture grass species promote soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and reduce N2O emission from urine deposited by grazing cattle. We determined SOC and N2O emissions from urine deposited on soils in an area of PG and in a 6.5 year-old IG area of Urochloa (Syn. Brachiaria) humidicola grass pasture in a beef cattle ranch in Orinoquía region (Colombia). In both areas, we sampled soil for chemical/physical analysis, and measured N2O emissions by simulating urine deposition over 21 days. We applied two-way analysis of variance considering pasture type and soil depth as fixed factors. Estimated SOC stocks (0–100 cm) were in the range of 224.8 Mg C ha−1 for the PG and 259.0 Mg C ha−1 for the IG, with a significant (p < 0.05) average accumulation of 2.0 Mg C ha−1 y−1 (0–20 cm) in the IG area. N2O emissions were 10 times lower in the IG compared to the PG. The introduction of U. humidicola grass influenced SOC accumulation probably through its more abundant root system and greater turnover together with higher (14%) forage dry matter production compared to PG. The reduced N2O emissions observed from urine patches in IG were attributed to biological nitrification inhibition ability and greater nitrogen uptake of U. humidicola grass. Compared to the reference default value of IPCC for, the SOC stock found in PG was almost 40% higher, whereas the N2O emission factor (5%) was within the uncertainty range (0.7–6%).

Estimated SOC stocks (0–100 cm) were in the range of 224.8 Mg C ha−1 for the PG and 259.0 Mg C ha−1 for the IG, with a significant (p < 0.05) average accumulation of 2.0 Mg C ha−1 y−1 (0–20 cm) in the IG area. N2O emissions were 10 times lower in the IG compared to the PG. The introduction of U. humidicola grass influenced SOC accumulation probably through its more abundant root system and greater turnover together with higher (14%) forage dry matter production compared to PG. The reduced N2O emissions observed from urine patches in IG were attributed to biological nitrification inhibition ability and greater nitrogen uptake of U. humidicola grass. Compared to the reference default value of IPCC for, the SOC stock found in PG was almost 40% higher, whereas the N2O emission factor (5%) was within the uncertainty range (0.7–6%). The Orinoquía region shows significant potential for SOC storage and reduced N2O emissions in improved pastures with deep root systems. Thus, scaling the implementation of land-based SOC storage practices/projects could significantly contribute to reducing net emissions from beef production from this region."
1786,INIT-01,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Estimating genetic gains for tolerance to stress combinations in tropical maize hybrids,"Maize is a strategic food crop in sub-Saharan Africa. However, most maize growing tropical savannas particularly in West and Central African experience the occurrence of frequent droughts and Striga infestation, resulting in 30–100% yield losses. This production zones need maize cultivars that combine tolerance to the two stresses. IITA in collaboration with national partners has thus employed a sequential selection scheme to incorporate both drought tolerance and Striga resistance in topical maize hybrids using reliable screening protocols. The main objective of the present study was therefore to use grain yield and other agronomic traits recorded in regional collaborative hybrid trials conducted for 8 years under manged stressful and non-stressful conditions and across rainfed field environments to estimate genetic gains in grain yields using mixed model analyses. The results showed significant (p < 0.05) annual yield gains of 11.89 kg ha−1 under manged drought stress (MDS) and 86.60 kg ha−1 under Striga infestation (STRIN) with concomitant yield increases of 62.65 kg ha−1 under full irrigation (WW), 102.44 kg ha−1 under Striga non-infested (STRNO) conditions and 53.11 kg ha−1 across rainfed field environments. Grain yield displayed significant but not strong genetic correlation of 0.41 ± 0.07 between MDS and STRIN, indicating that gene expression was not consistent across the two stress conditions. Furthermore, grain yield recorded in MET had significant moderate genetic correlations of 0.58 ± 0.06 and 0.44 ± 0.07It with MDS and STRIN, respectively. These results emphasize the need to screen inbred linens under both stress conditions to further enhance the rate of genetic gain in grain yield in hybrids for areas where the two stresses co-occur.

Using multiple climate-relevant datasets, a diagnosis of the climate of the Limpopo basin was carried out, and the relevance of using the SPEI drought index for characterizing droughts was also assessed. The results showed strong climatic seasonality, in addition to the strong relationship between the seasonal drought conditions captured by SPEI. Outputs from four climate models, gridded rainfall observations, and a machine-learning method were used to generate a real-time experimental probabilistic forecast of rainfall in the Limpopo basin.

We present rapid assessment methods based on easily available spatial data and adoption costs for mitigation related to crops, livestock and forestry to identify priority locations and actions. Applying the methods for the case of Mexico, we found a national mitigation potential of 87.88 million tons (Mt) CO2eq yr−1, comprising 7.91, 7.66 and 72.31 Mt CO2eq yr−1 from crops, livestock and forestry/agro-forestry, respectively. At the state level, mitigation potentials were highest in Chiapas (13 Mt CO2eq) followed by Campeche (8 Mt CO2eq). Eleven states had a land use mitigation potential between 2.5 to 6.5 Mt CO2eq, while other states had mitigation potentials of less than 2 Mt CO2eq. Mitigation options for crops and livestock could reduce 60% and 6% of the respective emissions. Mitigation options for forestry could reduce emissions by half.

We present rapid assessment methods based on easily available spatial data and adoption costs for mitigation related to crops, livestock and forestry to identify priority locations and actions. Applying the methods for the case of Mexico, we found a national mitigation potential of 87.88 million tons (Mt) CO2eq yr−1, comprising 7.91, 7.66 and 72.31 Mt CO2eq yr−1 from crops, livestock and forestry/agro-forestry, respectively. At the state level, mitigation potentials were highest in Chiapas (13 Mt CO2eq) followed by Campeche (8 Mt CO2eq). Eleven states had a land use mitigation potential between 2.5 to 6.5 Mt CO2eq, while other states had mitigation potentials of less than 2 Mt CO2eq. Mitigation options for crops and livestock could reduce 60% and 6% of the respective emissions. Mitigation options for forestry could reduce emissions by half. If properly implemented, mitigation potentials on cropland can be realized with net benefits, compared to livestock and forestry options, which involve net costs. The method supports science-based priority setting of mitigation actions by location and subsector and should help inform future policy and implementation of countries’ nationally determined contributions."

Supplementation with protein is known to improve the nutritive value of the otherwise low-quality diets. However, animal nutrition studies in East Africa that are accompanied by CH4 emission measurements are lacking. Thus, an animal experiment was conducted to quantify the effect of supplementing cattle fed mainly on low-quality Urochloa brizantha hay (control diet; CON; crude protein (CP) = 7.4%) or supplemented with either a tannin-rich leguminous fodder, Desmodium intortum hay (DES) or a commercial dairy concentrate (CUBES) on voluntary dry matter intake (DMI), nutrient apparent total tract digestibility, nitrogen (N) retention, enteric CH4 production and animal performance (milk and average daily gain). Twelve mid-lactating crossbred (Friesian × Boran) cows (initial liveweight = 335 kg) were used in a 3×3 (Period × Diet) Latin square design with each period running for four weeks. Compared to CON, DES decreased nutrient (DM, OM, CP) intake, apparent total tract digestibility and daily milk yield. In contrast, CUBES increased nutrient intake and animal performance compared to CON, while nutrients’ apparent total tract digestibility was not different, except for CP digestibility that increased. Compared to CON, DES and CUBES improved overall N retention by the animals as a proportion of N intake. The DES diet compared with CON and CUBES, shifted the proportion of N excretion via urine to the fecal route, likely because of its tannin content. Both DES and CUBES, compared to CON, reduced methane yield (MY, g CH4/kg DMI) by 15% and 9%, respectively. The DES diet reduced absolute enteric CH4 emissions by 26% while CUBES increased emissions by 11% compared to CON. Based on the present findings, high supplementation levels (&gt;50%) of Desmodium intortum hay is not recommended especially when the basal diet is low in CP content. Supplementation with lower levels of better managed Desmodium intortum forage however, need to be investigated to establish optimal inclusion levels that will improve animal productivity and reduce environmental impact of livestock in smallholder tropical contexts."

Integration of trees into farming systems has been advocated as a measure to deliver ecosystem services, inter alia climate regulation and adaptation, water quality regulation, provisioning of fibre, fuel and habitats to support biodiversity. Despite the rapid expansion of cattle farming in the tropics, notably in Latin America, there is little robust evidence on the extent to which trees are able to mitigate the effects of cattle farming in this ecological zone. This article describes a case study conducted on a large, specialised dairy farm in Costa Rica, where two-thirds of the field boundaries are live tree fences. For the first time, this study quantifies the offset potential of trees by estimating rate of carbon sequestration in a silvopastoral system (SPS) in the tropics. It was found that over a 30-month interval, trees sequestered 1.43 Mg C ha−1 year−1 above and below ground. Attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) (cradle to farm gate) was applied to calculate the carbon footprint of milk produced on the farm for the years 2016 to 2018. Trees in live fences offset 21–37% of milk footprints, resulting in residual net footprints of 0.75±0.25 to 0.84±0.26 kg CO2 eq. kg−1 milk. Exclusion of life cycle emissions that may not fall within national emission inventory accounting (e.g. fertiliser manufacture and feed production) increased the mean offset from 27 to 34% of gross milk footprint. Although based on temporally limited data (30 months), our findings indicate that a live fence SPS could play an important role in short- to medium-term climate mitigation from livestock production, buying time for deployment of long-term mitigation and adaptation planning."

2003,INIT-32,Initiative output,Knowledge product,The role of sectoral coverage in emission abatement costs: Evidence from marginal cost savings,"Sectoral coverage that plays a critical role in operationalizing the emission trading scheme (ETS), has gained substantive attention. Despite the insightful views on sectoral coverage from the emission reduction potential or carbon leakage, previous studies overlook the cost-effectiveness of ETS in the sense that the varying marginal contributions of each sector to reducing emission abatement costs (EACs) (which is defined as marginal cost savings, MCSs) remain underexplored. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a costs-oriented approach for sectoral coverage (COASCO), which ranks the sectors by estimating and comparing their MCSs. Taking China's climate targets by 2030 as an example, we conduct an empirical study that implements the COASCO method to explore the impacts of sectoral coverage on China's EACs. Our analysis demonstrates that, while coverage extension generally reduces China's EACs, a small sectoral coverage can already lead to a substantial decline in the national EACs. The results underpin the Pareto principle that covering six sectors (i.e. Electricity production, Metallurgy, Transport and storage, Petroleum and gas, Nonmetal mining) out of 29 can reduce China's EACs by over 80% compared to covering Electricity production only. Although coverage extension may reduce the differences in EACs between sectors and improve market activation, extending the sectoral coverage probably gives rise to the number of big carbon traders, which then increases the risks of market manipulation. As a result, covering those six sectors can reach a balance between ETS market activation and risks. By providing a generalized and systematic framework for determining the sectoral coverage, this study makes it possible to minimize the total EACs associated with any sectoral coverages, thus assisting policymakers in fulfilling China's latest ambitious goals of reaching carbon peaking by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 in a cost-effective manner.",Kevin Chen,(0) Not targeted,(2) Principal,NA,0,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,IFPRI,NA,• [INIT-32] 4.3   Institutional arrangements to facilitate scaling of technologies,• Systems Transformation,"• Climate Adaptation and Mitigation

The appropriate quantification of GHG emissions, specifically methane (CH4), has raised questions about the correct reporting of GHG inventories and, perhaps more importantly, how best to mitigate CH4 emissions. This review documents existing methods and methodologies to measure and estimate CH4 emissions from ruminant animals and the manure produced therein over various scales and conditions. Measurements of CH4 have frequently been conducted in research settings using classical methodologies developed for bioenergetic purposes, such as gas exchange techniques (respiration chambers, headboxes). While very precise, these techniques are limited to research settings as they are expensive, labor-intensive, and applicable only to a few animals. Head-stalls, such as the GreenFeed system, have been used to measure expired CH4 for individual animals housed alone or in groups in confinement or grazing. This technique requires frequent animal visitation over the diurnal measurement period and an adequate number of collection days. The tracer gas technique can be used to measure CH4 from individual animals housed outdoors, as there is a need to ensure low background concentrations. Micrometeorological techniques (e.g., open-path lasers) can measure CH4 emissions over larger areas and many animals, but limitations exist, including the need to measure over more extended periods. Measurement of CH4 emissions from manure depends on the type of storage, animal housing, CH4 concentration inside and outside the boundaries of the area of interest, and ventilation rate, which is likely the variable that contributes the greatest to measurement uncertainty. For large-scale areas, aircraft, drones, and satellites have been used in association with the tracer flux method, inverse modeling, imagery, and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), but research is lagging in validating these methods. Bottom-up approaches to estimating CH4 emissions rely on empirical or mechanistic modeling to quantify the contribution of individual sources (enteric and manure). In contrast, top-down approaches estimate the amount of CH4 in the atmosphere using spatial and temporal models to account for transportation from an emitter to an observation point. While these two estimation approaches rarely agree, they help identify knowledge gaps and research requirements in practice."

2376,INIT-23,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Disruptive seeds: a scenario approach to explore power shifts in sustainability transformations,"Over the last 2 decades, it has become increasingly evident that incremental adaptation to global environmental challenges—particularly climate change—no longer suffices. To make matters worse, systemic problems such as social inequity and unsustainable use of resources prove to be persistent. These challenges call for, such is the rationale, significant and radical systemic changes that challenge incumbent structures. Remarkably, scholarship on sustainability transformations has only engaged with the role of power dynamics and shifts in a limited fashion. This paper responds to a need for methods that support the creation of imaginative transformation pathways while attending to the roles that power shifts play in transformations. To do this, we extended the “Seeds of Good Anthropocenes” approach, incorporating questions derived from scholarship on power into the methodology. Our ‘Disruptive Seeds’ approach focuses on niche practices that actively challenge unsustainable incumbent actors and institutions. We tested this novel approach in a series of participatory pilot workshops. Generally, the approach shows great potential as it facilitates explicit discussion about the way power shifts may unfold in transformations. It is a strong example of the value of mixing disciplinary perspectives to create new forms of scenario thinking—following the call for more integrated work on anticipatory governance that combines futures thinking with social and political science research into governance and power. Specifically, the questions about power shifts in transformations used in this paper to adapt the Seeds approach can also be used to adapt other future methods that similarly lack a focus on power shifts—for instance, explorative scenarios, classic back-casting approaches, and simulation gaming.",Lucas Rutting,(2) Principal,(2) Principal,NA,1,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,CIAT (Alliance),NA,• [INIT-23] 3.2 Policy pathways to mainstream disruptive niche bottom-up initiatives,• Systems Transformation,"• Climate Adaptation and Mitigation

Remarkably, scholarship on sustainability transformations has only engaged with the role of power dynamics and shifts in a limited fashion. This paper responds to a need for methods that support the creation of imaginative transformation pathways while attending to the roles that power shifts play in transformations. To do this, we extended the “Seeds of Good Anthropocenes” approach, incorporating questions derived from scholarship on power into the methodology. Our ‘Disruptive Seeds’ approach focuses on niche practices that actively challenge unsustainable incumbent actors and institutions. We tested this novel approach in a series of participatory pilot workshops. Generally, the approach shows great potential as it facilitates explicit discussion about the way power shifts may unfold in transformations. It is a strong example of the value of mixing disciplinary perspectives to create new forms of scenario thinking—following the call for more integrated work on anticipatory governance that combines futures thinking with social and political science research into governance and power. Specifically, the questions about power shifts in transformations used in this paper to adapt the Seeds approach can also be used to adapt other future methods that similarly lack a focus on power shifts—for instance, explorative scenarios, classic back-casting approaches, and simulation gaming."

Though it is widely assumed that IVs have a high potential to contribute to food security of West African countries, a comprehensive assessment of farming systems addressing agricultural, institutional, food security, poverty, and ecosystem indicators is still lacking. This study characterizes IVs' smallholder farm households at the regional and farm type level using Rural Household Multiple Indicator Survey (RHoMIS) data collected from 733 randomly selected farm households in four agro-ecological regions, i.e., Bouaké and Gagnoa in Cote d'Ivoire, and Ahafo Ano North and Ahafo Ano South in Ghana.

Furthermore, farm households' food security and poverty status, and the importance of rice in the portfolio of crops, is assessed.

2579,INIT-01,Initiative output,Knowledge product,The influence of genetic architecture on responses to selection under drought in rice,"Accurately predicting responses to selection is a major goal in biology and important for successful crop breeding in changing environments. However, evolutionary responses to selection can be constrained by such factors as genetic and cross-environment correlations, linkage, and pleiotropy, and our understanding of the extent and impact of such constraints is still developing. Here, we conducted a field experiment to investigate potential constraints to selection for drought resistance in rice (Oryza sativa) using phenotypic selection analysis and quantitative genetics. We found that traits related to drought response were heritable, and some were under selection, including selection for earlier flowering, which could allow drought escape. However, patterns of selection generally were not opposite under wet and dry conditions, and we did not find individual or closely linked genes that influenced multiple traits, indicating a lack of evidence that antagonistic pleiotropy, linkage, or cross-environment correlations would constrain selection for drought resistance. In most cases, genetic correlations had little influence on responses to selection, with direct and indirect selection largely congruent. The exception to this was seed mass under drought, which was predicted to evolve in the opposite direction of direct selection due to correlations. Because of this indirect effect on selection on seed mass, selection for drought resistance was not accompanied by a decrease in seed mass, and yield increased with fecundity. Furthermore, breeding lines with high fitness and yield under drought also had high fitness and yield under wet conditions, indicating that there was no evidence for a yield penalty on drought resistance. We found multiple genes in which expression influenced both water use efficiency (WUE) and days to first flowering, supporting a genetic basis for the trade-off between drought escape and avoidance strategies. Together, these results can provide helpful guidance for understanding and managing evolutionary constraints and breeding stress-resistant crops.","Henry, Amelia (IRRI) <a.henry@irri.org>",(0) Not targeted,(2) Principal,NA,0,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,IRRI,NA,"• [INIT-01] Genomics-supported RSS schemes, optimized breeding pipelines and pipeline structure",• Not Linked,• Not Linked,• Not Linked,"• UC - University of California [Innovation] - United States of America

However, patterns of selection generally were not opposite under wet and dry conditions, and we did not find individual or closely linked genes that influenced multiple traits, indicating a lack of evidence that antagonistic pleiotropy, linkage, or cross-environment correlations would constrain selection for drought resistance. In most cases, genetic correlations had little influence on responses to selection, with direct and indirect selection largely congruent. The exception to this was seed mass under drought, which was predicted to evolve in the opposite direction of direct selection due to correlations. Because of this indirect effect on selection on seed mass, selection for drought resistance was not accompanied by a decrease in seed mass, and yield increased with fecundity. Furthermore, breeding lines with high fitness and yield under drought also had high fitness and yield under wet conditions, indicating that there was no evidence for a yield penalty on drought resistance. We found multiple genes in which expression influenced both water use efficiency (WUE) and days to first flowering, supporting a genetic basis for the trade-off between drought escape and avoidance strategies. Together, these results can provide helpful guidance for understanding and managing evolutionary constraints and breeding stress-resistant crops."
2580,INIT-01,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Breeding rice for a changing climate by improving adaptations to water saving technologies,"Climate change is expected to increasingly affect rice production through rising temperatures and decreasing water availability. Unlike other crops, rice is a main contributor to greenhouse gas emissions due to methane emissions from flooded paddy fields. Climate change can therefore be addressed in two ways in rice: through making the crop more climate resilient and through changes in management practices that reduce methane emissions and thereby slow global warming. In this review, we focus on two water saving technologies that reduce the periods lowland rice will be grown under fully flooded conditions, thereby improving water use efficiency and reducing methane emissions. Rice breeding over the past decades has mostly focused on developing high-yielding varieties adapted to continuously flooded conditions where seedlings were raised in a nursery and transplanted into a puddled flooded soil. Shifting cultivation to direct-seeded rice or to introducing non-flooded periods as in alternate wetting and drying gives rise to new challenges which need to be addressed in rice breeding. New adaptive traits such as rapid uniform germination even under anaerobic conditions, seedling vigor, weed competitiveness, root plasticity, and moderate drought tolerance need to be bred into the current elite germplasm and to what extent this is being addressed through trait discovery, marker-assisted selection and population improvement are reviewed.","Dixit, Shalabh (IRRI) <s.dixit@irri.org>",(0) Not targeted,(2) Principal,NA,0,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,IRRI,NA,"• [INIT-01] Elite donor lines carrying highly valuable, in-demand traits",• Genetic Innovation,"• Climate Adaptation and Mitigation

Grain quality is paramount in determining its value and downstream use. While we know that climate change threatens global crop yields, a better understanding of impacts on wheat end-use quality is also critical. Combining quantitative genetics with climate model outputs, we investigated UK-wide trends in genotypic adaptation for wheat quality traits. In our approach, we augmented genomic prediction models with environmental characterisation of field trials to predict trait values and climate effects in historical field trial data between 2001 and 2020. Addition of environmental covariates, such as temperature and rainfall, successfully enabled prediction of genotype by environment interactions (G × E), and increased prediction accuracy of most traits for new genotypes in new year cross validation. We then extended predictions from these models to much larger numbers of simulated environments using climate scenarios projected under Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 for 2050–2069. We found geographically varying climate change impacts on wheat quality due to contrasting associations between specific weather covariables and quality traits across the UK. Notably, negative impacts on quality traits were predicted in the East of the UK due to increased summer temperatures while the climate in the North and South-west may become more favourable with increased summer temperatures. Furthermore, by projecting 167,040 simulated future genotype–environment combinations, we found only limited potential for breeding to exploit predictable G × E to mitigate year-to-year environmental variability for most traits except Hagberg falling number.

2691,INIT-34,Initiative output,Knowledge product,The politics of governing resilience: Gendered dimensions of climate-smart agriculture in Kenya,"This paper uses climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in Kenya as an empirical entry point for investigating how climate actions reshape or reinforce gender relations, and how they are aimed at improving local resilience that is nested in such relations. While enhancing national food security, CSA practices could however reproduce inequitable power relations, such as gendered authority relations that produce vulnerability and inequalities. Equity and knowledge represent particularly contested aspects of CSA because it largely fails to address who wins and who loses from such interventions, who are able to participate while others are excluded, and whose knowledge and perspectives count in decision-making processes. Gender relations provide a stark illustration of the way that CSA fails to address how enduring inequalities of access in both production and consumption shape who is rendered vulnerable to climate change and who is left food insecure. In this paper, we treat CSA projects as a site of tensions between stability and contestation of gender relations, brought into view through moments where practices and knowledges are (re)shaped. We first review the concepts of authority, recognition, and resilience as a framework to understand how gendered inequalities and struggles over rights to resources are perpetuated within adaptation and resilience responses to climate variability. We analyze evidence from past studies regarding rural adaptation processes and gender dimensions in CSA projects to identify how such projects may modify the space for renegotiating inequitable gender relations. We approach gender relations as authority relations that are constantly internalized, resisted, and contested through practices and interactions between different actors associated with CSA projects, and the different knowledges that direct these practices. The examination focuses on Kenya as an empirical context to gain sufficient depth in understanding the social and political processes in which climate actions and gender relations are nested, enabling us to identify key points of intersection within these two themes.

It is meant to expand our comprehension of climate-related security risks in Senegal, by examining the way local communities capitalise on everyday experience to develop a shared understanding around the effects of climate change over their livelihoods and wellbeing, along with the insecurity problems they collectively face. Ongoing community-level responses are also discussed, identifying short-term coping and long-term adaptive strategies which have most successfully enhanced local capacities towards managing climate risks, along with those which are currently being overwhelmed. This evidence on adaptive strategies is then used as a base to propose solutions based on collective action, through a reflective dialogue with community members, meant to address climate-related security risks and to challenge institutional structures that sustain the underlying causes of vulnerability."""

2724,INIT-23,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Climate Security Observatory Country profile: Senegal,"Senegal has far fewer conflicts than any other country in the Sahel and is considered one of the most stable countries in Africa. However, the south of the country is the scene of the longest-running armed conflict in Africa between the government and separatist groups in Casamance. Although it has evolved since the early 2000s into a low-intensity war that does not pose a significant security threat, it is still a source of instability in certain areas of the south of the country, where rebels control illegal logging and timber trade. While the conflict is primarily related to lower socioeconomic development and resentment of the central government, which has exacerbated feelings of marginalization and increased separatist sentiment, deteriorating climatic conditions and the increasing number of extreme weather events may negatively affect conflict and security dynamics in the country through their impact on natural resource availability and livelihoods.

Global gridded climate–crop model ensembles are increasingly used to make projections of how climate change will affect future crop yield. However, the level of certainty that can be attributed to such simulations is unknown. Here, using currently available geospatial datasets and a widely employed simulation procedure, we created a wheat model ensemble of 1,440 global simulations of 20 climate scenarios, 3 crop models, 4 parameterization strategies and 3 management inputs of sowing date. We quantified the contributions of climate, model, parameterization and management to the overall uncertainty to predicted responses of yield to warming, then related the results to the latitude of the grid cells. For all warming scenarios, the total uncertainty for mid- and high latitudes is much larger than for low latitudes. Uncertainty arising from crop models was larger than that from the other sources combined. Parameterizing crop models with grid-specific information on wheat cultivars tended to decrease the crop model uncertainty, particularly for low latitudes. Crop model improvements and better-quality spatial input data more closely representing the wide range of growing conditions around the world will be needed to reduce the uncertainty of climate change impact assessment of crop yields.",On crops,Wheat: Impacts du to future warming,"peer reviewed journal article showing 20 climate scenarios, 3 crop models, 4 parametization strategies and 3 management inputs"
2828,INIT-32,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Exploring new opportunities for improving AFOLU emissions reporting and the current status of AFOLU emissions for non-annex I countries,"This policy brief has two main objectives. In a first instance, it aims to give an overview of how non-Annex I countries are currently communicating on the necessary elements (targets, monitoring plans, accounting mechanisms, implementation and achievements) for tracking their Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) progress. Non-Annex I countries are to be understood as developing countries under the Kyoto Protocol. Contrary to Annex I countries, which are understood as developed countries and countries undergoing the process of transition to a market economy, non-Annex I countries do not have legally binding emissions reductions targets. With the existing transparency arrangements, Annex-I parties have demonstrated their ability in meeting the delivery of required information. On the other hand, non-Annex I parties have demonstrated limited experience in reporting mitigation action, which challenges not only tracking progress toward national targets but also towards global goals (Vaidyula & Rocha, 2018). 



In a second instance, this policy brief also aims to summarize the current status of CO2 emissions from the Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) sector in regions covering non-Annex I countries. Given that the AFOLU sector is both a source and a sink of CO2 emissions, land-based mitigations are quickly being recognized as key measures to achieve the Paris Agreement’s (PA) goal of reducing global emissions. However, findings suggest that AFOLU activities have considerable variations among different data sources, with no clear patterns across considered regions, with some sources indicating an increase in some places and others indicating a decline over the period 2010-2015 (Nyawira et al 2022).

2830,INIT-14,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Applying agroclimatic seasonal forecasts to improve rainfed maize agronomic management in Colombia,"Climate variability affects crop production in multiple and often complex ways. The development and use hybrid crops with greater productivity and tolerance to climate shocks is one of the approaches to climate adaptation and agricultural intensification. Since hybrid crops are more expensive for the producer, risk management is of paramount importance. Here, we pose that there is high potential for the Colombian maize sector to use crop-specific climate services for risk reduction. We used the CERES-Maize crop model connected to seasonal climate forecasts developed via Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) across key maize growing areas in Colombia to assess the performance of a maize-specific agroclimatic forecast to inform two key decisions, namely, the choice of sowing dates and genotypes. We find that the agroclimatic models perform well at discriminating yield categories (above, below, and normal) with discrimination capacity of up to 70–80 % for the ‘below normal’ and ‘above + below normal’ categories. Consistent with this, agroclimatic forecasts typically predict the optimal planting date with an error of 3 pentads or less. They also predict the optimal choice of genotype correctly around 50–70 % of the time depending on the site or season of interest. Notably, we identify specific cases in which the agroclimatic forecast is misleading but argue that the overall value of the forecasts outweighs these cases.

2936,INIT-10,Initiative output,Knowledge product,A new index on agricultural land greenhouse gas emissions in Africa,"Africa emits the lowest amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the global GHG budget. However, the continent remains the most vulnerable continent to the effects of climate change. The agricultural sector in Africa is among the most vulnerable sectors to climate change. Also, as a dominant agricultural sector, African agriculture is increasingly contributing to climate change through GHG emissions. Research has so far focused on the effects of GHG emissions on the agricultural and other sectors with very little emphasis on monitoring and quantifying the spatial distribution of GHG emissions from agricultural land in Africa. This study develops a new index: African Agricultural Land Greenhouse Gas Index (AALGGI) that uses scores and specific scale ranges for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) to map the spatial variations in regional GHG emissions across Africa. The data for the three main GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N20) were downloaded from FAOSTAT. The data were analyzed through the newly developed African Agricultural Land Greenhouse Gas Index (AALGGI). This is an empirical index with scores ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher levels of emissions. The results show that Southern and North African regions have the lowest amounts of agricultural land GHG emissions, with AALGGIs of 3.5 and 4.5, respectively. East Africa records the highest levels of GHG emissions, with an AALGGI of 8 followed by West Africa with an AALGGI of 7.5.

Accurate reporting of livestock greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is important in developing effective mitigation strategies, but the cost and labour requirements associated with on-farm data collection often prevent this effort in low- and middle-income countries. 

Aim. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the precision and accuracy of simplified activity data collection protocols in African smallholder livestock farms for country-specific enteric-methane emission factors. 

Method. 
Activity data such as live weight (LW), feed quality, milk yield, and milk composition were collected from 257 smallholder farms, with a total herd of 1035 heads of cattle in Nandi and Bomet counties in western Kenya. The data collection protocol was then altered by substituting the actual LW measurements with algorithm LW (ALG), feed quality (FQ) data being sourced from the Feedipedia database, reducing the need for daily milk yield records to a single seasonal milk measurement (MiY), and by using a default energy content of milk (MiE). Daily methane production (DMP) was calculated using these simplified protocols and the estimates under individual and combined protocols were compared with values derived from the published (PUBL) estimation protocol. 

Key results. 
Employing the algorithm LW showed good agreement in DMP, with only a small negative bias (7%) and almost no change in variance. Calculating DMP on the basis of Feedipedia FQ, by contrast, resulted in a 27% increase in variation and a 27% positive bias for DMP compared with PUBL. The substitutions of milk (MiY and MiE) showed a modest change in variance and almost no bias in DMP. 

Conclusion. 
It is feasible to use a simplified data collection protocol by using algorithm LW, the default energy content of milk value, and seasonal single milk yield data, but full sampling and analysis of feed resources are required to produce reliable Tier 2 enteric-methane emission factors. 

Implications. 
Reducing enteric methane emissions from livestock is a promising pathway to reduce the effects of climate change, and, hence, the need to produce accurate emission estimates as a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of mitigation options. However, it is expensive to produce accurate emission estimates, especially in developing countries; hence, it is important and feasible to simplify on-farm data collection."

A cross-sectional survey among 671 sample households was conducted in Kairouan and Zaghouan. To understand the key drivers of each livelihood coping strategy and compare different livelihood strategies we used an updated version of we used and updated the resilience analysis framework. A special attention was given understand how household-level characteristics correspond to household coping strategies towards an identification and assessment of the coping mechanisms adopted by farmers to mitigate the impact of drought on their livelihood and food security. Results showed income and food access, assets possession, access to basic services, adaptive capacity, and social safety nets have positive and significant effect on farm households’ resilience to food insecurity. Climate change and stability have a negative and significant effects. This could be due to the negative effect of the climate change especially drought on the household resilience."

The development of crop disease monitoring and forecasting tools is an important effort to aid farmers in adapting to climate variability and change. Recognizing weather as a main driver of fungal disease outbreaks, this work assesses the climate suitability for wheat blast (Magnaporthe oryzae pathotype Triticum, MoT) development in Asian wheat-producing countries. MOT was reported for the first time in Bangladesh in 2016 and could spread to other countries, provided that environmental conditions are suitable to spore development, distribution, and infection. With results from a generic infection model driven by air temperature and humidity, and motivated by the necessity to assess the potential distribution of MoT based on the response to weather drivers only, we quantify potential MOT infection events across Asia for the period 1980–2019. The results show a potential higher incidence of MOT in Bangladesh, Myanmar, and some areas of India, where the number of potential infection (NPI) events averaged up to 15 during wheat heading. Interannual trends show an increase in NPI over those three countries, which in turns show their higher interannual variability. Cold/dry conditions in countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan appear to render them unlikely candidates for MOT establishment.

313,INIT-32,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from irrigated rice cultivation through improved fertilizer and water management,"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture sector play an important role for global warming and climate change. Thus, it is necessary to find out GHG emissions mitigation strategies from rice cultivation. The efficient management of nitrogen fertilizer using urea deep placement (UDP) and the use of the water-saving alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation could mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reduce environmental pollution. However, there is a dearth of studies on the impacts of UDP and the integrated plant nutrient system (IPNS) which combines poultry manure and prilled urea (PU) with different irrigation regimes on GHG emissions, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and rice yields. We conducted field experiments during the dry seasons of 2018, 2019, and 2020 to compare the effects of four fertilizer treatments including control (no N), PU, UDP, and IPNS in combination with two irrigation systems— (AWD and continuous flooding, CF) on GHG emissions, NUE and rice yield. Fertilizer treatments had significant (p < 0.05) interaction effects with irrigation regimes on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. PU reduced CH4 and N2O emissions by 6% and 20% compared to IPNS treatment, respectively under AWD irrigation, but produced similar emissions under CF irrigation. Similarly, UDP reduced cumulative CH4 emissions by 9% and 15% under AWD irrigation, and 9% and 11% under CF condition compared to PU and IPNS treatments, respectively. Across the year and fertilizer treatments, AWD irrigation significantly (p < 0.05) reduced cumulative CH4 emissions and GHG intensity by 28%, and 26%, respectively without significant yield loss compared to CF condition. Although AWD irrigation increased cumulative N2O emissions by 73%, it reduced the total global warming potential by 27% compared to CF irrigation. The CH4 emission factor for AWD was lower (1.67 kg ha− 1 day− 1) compared to CF (2.33 kg ha− 1 day− 1). Across the irrigation regimes, UDP increased rice yield by 21% and N recovery efficiency by 58% compared to PU.

323,INIT-01,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Effect of High Temperature Stress During the Reproductive Stage on Grain Yield and Nutritional Quality of Lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus),"High temperature during the reproductive stage limits the growth and development of lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus). The reproductive and seed filling periods are the most sensitive to heat stress, resulting in limited yield and nutritional quality. Climate change causes frequent incidents of heat stress for global food crop production. This study aimed to assess the impact of high temperature during the reproductive stage of lentil on grain yield, nutritional value, and cooking quality. Thirty-six lentil genotypes were evaluated under controlled conditions for their high temperature response. Genotypic variation was significant (p < 0.001) for all the traits under study. High temperature-induced conditions reduced protein, iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in lentils. Under heat stress conditions, mineral concentrations among lentil genotypes varied from 6.0 to 8.8 mg/100 g for Fe and from 4.9 to 6.6 mg/100 g for Zn. Protein ranged from 21.9 to 24.3 g/100 g. Cooking time was significantly reduced due to high temperature treatment; the range was 3–11 min, while under no stress conditions, cooking time variation was from 5 to 14 min. Phytic acid variation was 0.5–1.2 g/100 g under no stress conditions, while under heat stress conditions, phytic acid ranged from 0.4 to 1.4 g/100 g. All genotypes had highly significant bioavailable Fe and moderately bioavailable Zn under no stress conditions. Whereas under heat stress conditions, Fe and Zn bioavailability was reduced due to increased phytic acid levels. Our results will greatly benefit the development of biofortified lentil cultivars for global breeding programs to generate promising genotypes with low phytic acid and phytic acid/micronutrient ratio to combat micronutrient malnutrition.","Agrawal, Shiv Kumar (ICARDA-India) <SK.Agrawal@cgiar.org>",(2) Principal,(2) Principal,NA,0,NA,No,NA,INIT-10,NA,ICARDA,NA,"• [INIT-10] EoIO 2 Government supports and facilitates the use Best Bet genetic innovations developed for CWANA

and deployment of drought-tolerant wheat varieties are important to cope with the challenge of
terminal moisture stress and increase wheat productivity. A panel composed of 200 elite spring
bread wheat genotypes was phenotyped for yield and agronomic traits for 2 years (2020 and 2021)
in Morocco under rainfed and irrigated environments. The panel was genotyped using 20K SNPs

Climate forecasts provide tools for decision-making and adaptation to climate extreme events. This report presents the preliminary results regarding the development of seasonal drought forecasts for the Limpopo River basin. Using multiple climate-relevant datasets, a diagnosis of the climate of the Limpopo basin was carried out, and the relevance of using the SPEI drought index for characterizing droughts was also assessed. The results showed strong climatic seasonality, in addition to the strong relationship between the seasonal drought conditions captured by SPEI. Outputs from four climate models, gridded rainfall observations, and a machine-learning method were used to generate a real-time experimental probabilistic forecast of rainfall in the Limpopo basin. Finally, the next steps are presented to meet the objectives of the Initiative, strengthening the capacities of the Limpopo Watercourse Commission."

Accelerated Breeding exchange learnings across crops. Insights may also benefit and attract follow-up by Market Intelligence (gaining market intelligence from farmer feedback) and Seed Equal (institutionalizing approaches for national advancement and variety registration decisions). While the individual crop- and pipeline-specific innovations are of technical nature, this result assesses the organizational change across crops.

3539,INIT-34,Initiative output,Knowledge product,How does climate exacerbate root causes of livestock-related conflicts in Kenya? An impact pathway analysis,"This factsheet gives answers on how climate exacerbates root causes of livestock-related conflict in

Kenya, using an impact pathway analysis. Three main impact pathways are identified:

1. Resource Access and Availability: Climate variability and extreme events are degrading natural

resources and diminishing the availability of water and pasture, especially in the ASALs. A movement

toward areas where there is relatively more availability of water than in the dry grasslands is leading to

resource competition and conflict among pastoralist groups and between pastoralists and farmers.

2. Cattle Rustling and Raiding: The most prevalent form of conflict, particularly in the north of Kenya,

is the violent theft of cattle, also known as cattle rustling. Although cattle rustling has historically

served as a culturally embedded practice for wealth redistribution and as a rite of passage, the level

of violence has increased due to the scarcity of natural resources induced by the effects of climate

change.

3. Livelihood and food insecurity: The combination of climate change and conflict places severe

pressure on the livelihood and food security of pastoralists, overburdening their adaptive capacities.

resulting in decreased yielding capacity. Drought is one of the most important constraints
limiting yield potential in crops and it is the major abiotic stress that can cause more than
70% yield loss in chickpea. In this study, a total of two hundred four chickpea (Cicer arieti num L.) genotypes were selected to study the interaction between drought stress and nod ule formation. This interaction was assessed by using morphological, yield and yield
components. The field experiments were laid out in two locations (Terbol and Kfardan sta tions, Bekaa valley, Lebanon) using Alpha lattice design with two replications and two water ing treatments (irrigation and rainfed) during 2016 and 2017 seasons. Parameters that were
measured include days to 50% flowering (DFL), day to maturity (DM), plant height (PLH),
nodule biomass (NB), nodule fresh weight (NFW), nodule dry weight (NDW), grain yield
(GY), Biological yield (BY), 100 seed weight (100SW) and drought tolerance stress (DTS).
The results indicated a significant variation between genotypes, environments and other
morphological, yield and yield components traits. Drought stress reduced significantly the
yield and the nodule’s characteristics, biological and grain yield. The genotypes with the
highest levels of drought tolerance, such as IG70399, IG8256, IG71832, IG70270, and
IG70272, showed a minimal decrease in yield and nodule biomass. Nodule observations
significantly and positively correlated with GY (0.36-0.38) under drought stress treatment.

As a consequence, there is a critical need for data on livestock GHG sources and sinks to develop national inventories, as well as conduct baseline measurements and intervention testing to mitigate GHG emissions and meet ambitious national climate goals. Our objective was to review studies on GHG emissions from livestock systems in SSA, as well as soil carbon storage in livestock-dominated systems (i.e., grasslands and rangelands), to evaluate best current data and suggest future research priorities. To this end, we compiled studies from SSA that determined emission factors (EFs) for enteric methane and manure emissions, along with studies on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in SSA. We found that there has been limited research on livestock GHG emissions and SOC relative to national ambitions for climate change mitigation in SSA. Enteric methane emission factors (EFs) in low productivity cattle systems may be lower than IPCC Tier 1 default EFs, whereas small ruminants (i.e. sheep and goats) had higher EFs compared to IPCC Tier 1 EFs. Manure EFs were equal to or lower than IPCC Tier 1 EFs for deposited manure (while grazing), manure applied as fertilizer, and manure management. SOC stocks for grasslands and rangelands in SSA show broad agreement with IPCC estimates, but there was a strong geographic bias and many studies did not report soil type, bulk density, or SOC stocks at >30 cm depth. In general, the largest data gaps included information for manure (quantity, quality, management), small ruminants, agropastoral/pastoralist systems, and in general from West Africa. Future research should focus on filling major data gaps on locally appropriate mitigation interventions and improving livestock activity data for developing Tier 2 GHG inventories in SSA.

472,PLAT-01,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Effectively targeting climate investments: A methodology for mapping climate–agriculture–gender inequality hotspots,"Climate change is influencing the transformation of agriculture and food systems across the globe in unprecedented ways. A large number of smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) who depend on these systems for their food and nutrition security, and incomes are experiencing increasing vulnerability. Women are at a particular disadvantage, given their lower adaptive capacity due to unequal access to productive resources and services, driven by deeply entrenched social and gender norms and other structural barriers. However, addressing these gender gaps can enable women to use their knowledge and skill to contribute to climate-resilient agriculture.

This paper proposes a methodology to map climate–agriculture–gender inequality hotspots at national and subnational levels where climate hazards, women’s exposure to climate hazards affecting food systems, and gender inequalities converge to impact women’s vulnerability to climate change. These hotspots are geographical areas where extreme climate hazards intersect with large concentrations of women participating in food systems and in the agricultural labor force, and with high levels of gender inequalities—and as such, result in high risk and exposure, low adaptive capacities, and higher vulnerability of women to adverse effects of climate change. The hotspots are identified using a set of indicators based on available secondary data comparable across the countries, conforming to the framework developed for this assessment, and using the Principal Component Analysis methodology. 

The paper also presents the results of the analysis emerging from the application of this methodology. This includes a global ranking of 87 LMICs in Latin America, Asia and Africa by a climate–agriculture–gender inequality hotspot index using representative national-level data.

550,INIT-18,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Adapted conservation agriculture practices can increase energy productivity and lower yield-scaled greenhouse gas emissions in coastal Bangladesh,"While numerous studies have documented the benefits of conservation agriculture (CA) in South Asia, most focus on favorable environments where farmers have reliable access to energy supporting irrigation and inputs. The performance of CA in South Asia’s under-developed coastal environments is comparatively understudied. In these environments, farmers are increasingly interested in growing a second crop to meet food security and income generation objectives in rotation following the predominant monsoon season rice crop, though labor, energy costs, and investment constraints limit their ability to do so. We hypothesized that rotating rice (Oryza sativa) with maize (Zea mays) using conservation agriculture, or CA (i.e., strip-tilled maize followed by unpuddled transplanted rice), or seasonally alternating tillage (SAT, i.e., strip-tilled maize followed by fully-tilled, puddled rice with residues retained across rotations) would reduce costs and energy use, increase energy-use efficiency, and reduce yield-scaled CO2-eq emissions (YSE) and total global warming potential (GWP), compared to farmers’ own practices (FP) and conventional full-tillage (CT) under the same rotation in Bangladesh’s coastal region. Starting with winter maize followed by summer rice, we evaluated four tillage and crop establishment treatments in farmer-managed experiments in partially irrigated and rainfed environments over three years in 35 farmer’s fields across Bangladesh’s coastal districts. Treatments included FP, CT, complete CA, and SAT under a rice-maize rotation. Across years, the full suite of CA practices and SAT were significantly more energy-efficient and energy-productive than FP or CT. The order of YSE in rice was CA< CT or FP < SAT while in maize, it was CA or SAT < FP < CT. Across environments, CA and SAT resulted in 15-18% higher yield at the cropping systems level (maize and rice yields combined) and 26-40% less manual labor than CT or FP. CA and SAT also reduced by 1-12% and 33-35% total production costs respective to CT and FP. This was associated with 13-17% greater grain energy output in CA and SAT, and 2-18% lower YSE, compared to CT or FP. While our data suggest that both CA and SAT can result in a range of positive agronomic, economic, and environmental outcomes compared to FP or CT, post-trial surveys and discussions with farmers revealed a strong practical aversion to use of the full suite of CA practices and preference for adapted practices due to logistical constraints in negotiating the hire of laborers for unpuddled manual transplanting.",NA,(0) Not targeted,(2) Principal,NA,0,NA,No,NA,INIT-20,• Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia,CIMMYT,NA,"• [INIT-18] 1.3 Agronomy packages

We hypothesized that rotating rice (Oryza sativa) with maize (Zea mays) using conservation agriculture, or CA (i.e., strip-tilled maize followed by unpuddled transplanted rice), or seasonally alternating tillage (SAT, i.e., strip-tilled maize followed by fully-tilled, puddled rice with residues retained across rotations) would reduce costs and energy use, increase energy-use efficiency, and reduce yield-scaled CO2-eq emissions (YSE) and total global warming potential (GWP), compared to farmers’ own practices (FP) and conventional full-tillage (CT) under the same rotation in Bangladesh’s coastal region. Starting with winter maize followed by summer rice, we evaluated four tillage and crop establishment treatments in farmer-managed experiments in partially irrigated and rainfed environments over three years in 35 farmer’s fields across Bangladesh’s coastal districts. Treatments included FP, CT, complete CA, and SAT under a rice-maize rotation. Across years, the full suite of CA practices and SAT were significantly more energy-efficient and energy-productive than FP or CT. The order of YSE in rice was CA< CT or FP < SAT while in maize, it was CA or SAT < FP < CT. Across environments, CA and SAT resulted in 15-18% higher yield at the cropping systems level (maize and rice yields combined) and 26-40% less manual labor than CT or FP. CA and SAT also reduced by 1-12% and 33-35% total production costs respective to CT and FP. This was associated with 13-17% greater grain energy output in CA and SAT, and 2-18% lower YSE, compared to CT or FP. While our data suggest that both CA and SAT can result in a range of positive agronomic, economic, and environmental outcomes compared to FP or CT, post-trial surveys and discussions with farmers revealed a strong practical aversion to use of the full suite of CA practices and preference for adapted practices due to logistical constraints in negotiating the hire of laborers for unpuddled manual transplanting."

In this study, 25 cowpea genotypes were evaluated in five environments using a lattice design during the 2017 and 2018 main cropping seasons. The objectives of this study were to estimate the magnitude of genotype by environment interaction (GEI) and grain yield stability of selected drought-tolerant cowpea genotypes across different environments. The additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model indicated the contribution of environment, genotype and GEI as 63.98, 2.66% and 16.30% of the total variation for grain yield, respectively.

Subsets of the Rice Diversity Panel 1 and Azucena × IR64 recombinant inbred lines were grown in two greenhouse and two rainout shelter experiments under drought stress to assess their shoot, root anatomical, and root architectural phenotypes. Root traits and root trait plasticity in response to drought varied with genotype and environment. The best-performing groups in the rainout shelter experiments had less plasticity of living tissue area in nodal roots than the worst performing groups. Root traits under drought were partitioned into similar groups or clusters via the partitioning-around-medoids algorithm, and this revealed two favorable integrated root phenotypes common within and across environments. One favorable integrated phenotype exhibited many, deep nodal roots with larger root cross-sectional area and more aerenchyma, while the other favorable phenotype exhibited many, deep nodal roots with small root cross-sectional area and small metaxylem vessels. Deeper roots with high theoretical axial hydraulic conductance combined with reduced root metabolic cost contributed to greater shoot biomass under drought. These results reflect how some root anatomical and architectural phenes work in concert as integrated phenotypes to influence the performance of plant under drought stress.

612,INIT-01,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Intriguing Role of Proline in Redox Potential Conferring High Temperature Stress Tolerance,"Proline is a proteinogenic amino acid synthesized from glutamate and ornithine. Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase are the two key enzymes involved in proline synthesis from glutamate. On the other hand, ornithine-δ-aminotransferase converts ornithine to pyrroline 5-carboxylate (P5C), an intermediate in the synthesis of proline as well as glutamate. Both proline dehydrogenase and P5C dehydrogenase convert proline back to glutamate. Proline accumulation is widespread in response to environmental challenges such as high temperatures, and it is known to defend plants against unpropitious situations promoting plant growth and flowering. While proline accumulation is positively correlated with heat stress tolerance in some crops, it has detrimental consequences in others. Although it has been established that proline is a key osmolyte, its exact physiological function during heat stress and plant ontogeny remains unknown. Emerging evidence pointed out its role as an overriding molecule in alleviating high temperature stress (HTS) by quenching singlet oxygen and superoxide radicals. Proline cycle acts as a shuttle and the redox couple (NAD+/NADH, NADP+/NADPH) appears to be highly crucial for energy transfer among different cellular compartments during plant development, exposure to HTS conditions and also during the recovery of stress. In this review, the progress made in recent years regarding its involvement in heat stress tolerance is highlighted.","Sreenivasulu, Nese  (IRRI) <n.sreenivasulu@irri.org>",(0) Not targeted,(2) Principal,NA,0,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,IRRI,NA,"• [INIT-01] Elite donor lines carrying highly valuable, in-demand traits",• Genetic Innovation,"• Climate Adaptation and Mitigation

In this review, the progress made in recent years regarding its involvement in heat stress tolerance is highlighted.",Breeding for resilience,Rice: Heat stress,"Proline is a proteinogenic amino acid synthesized from glutamate and ornithine. Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase are the two key enzymes involved in proline synthesis from glutamate. On the other hand, ornithine-δ-aminotransferase converts ornithine to pyrroline 5-carboxylate (P5C), an intermediate in the synthesis of proline as well as glutamate. Both proline dehydrogenase and P5C dehydrogenase convert proline back to glutamate. Proline accumulation is widespread in response to environmental challenges such as high temperatures, and it is known to defend plants against unpropitious situations promoting plant growth and flowering. While proline accumulation is positively correlated with heat stress tolerance in some crops, it has detrimental consequences in others. Although it has been established that proline is a key osmolyte, its exact physiological function during heat stress and plant ontogeny remains unknown. Emerging evidence pointed out its role as an overriding molecule in alleviating high temperature stress (HTS) by quenching singlet oxygen and superoxide radicals. Proline cycle acts as a shuttle and the redox couple (NAD+/NADH, NADP+/NADPH) appears to be highly crucial for energy transfer among different cellular compartments during plant development, exposure to HTS conditions and also during the recovery of stress.

Optimization of IRRI’s rice drought breeding program is crucial for better implementation of selections based on predictions. Historical datasets with precise and robust pedigree information have been a great resource to help optimize the prediction models in the breeding programs. Here, we leveraged 17 years of historical drought data along with the pedigree information to predict the new lines or environments and dissect the G × E interactions. Seven models ranging from basic to proposed higher advanced models incorporating interactions, and genotypic specific effects were used. These models were tested with three cross-validation schemes (CV1, CV2, and CV0) to assess the predictive ability of tested and untested lines in already observed environments and tested lines in novel or new environments. In general, the highest prediction abilities were obtained when the model accounting interactions between pedigrees (additive) and environment were included. The CV0 scheme (predicting unobserved or novel environments) reveals very low predictive abilities among the three schemes. CV1 and CV2 schemes that borrow information from the target and correlated environments have much higher predictive abilities. Further, predictive ability was lower when predicting lines in non-stress conditions using drought data as training set and/or vice-versa. When predicting the lines using the data sets under the same conditions (stress or non-stress data sets), much better prediction accuracy was obtained. These results provide conclusive evidence that modeling G × E interactions are important in predictions. Thus, considering G × E interactions would help to build enhanced genomic or pedigree-based prediction models in the rice breeding program.

However, a need remains for improved productivity and adaptation to the risks associated with climate change. To accomplish this, the increased adoption of climate-resilient and high-yielding rice varieties can be beneficial. Therefore, we conducted a study in Bangladesh over three consecutive

years: 2016, 2017, and 2018. The scope of the study included the major cropping season (wet), Aman.  The yield advantages of climate-resilient rice varieties were evaluated and compared with those of the varieties popular with farmers. We included new stress-tolerant varieties, such as submergencetolerant rice (BRRI dhan51 and BRRI dhan52) and drought-tolerant rice (BRRI dhan56 and BRRI dhan71), along with farmer-chosen controls, in the study. We conducted the evaluation through on-farm trials to compare the varieties in both submergence- and drought-affected environments. The seasonal trials provided measured results of yield advantages. The participating farmers were also studied over the three-year-period to capture their varietal adoption rates. We calculated both the location estimated yield advantages (LEYA) and the location observed yield advantages (LOYA). The results revealed that, under non-stress conditions, the grain yields of climate-resilient varieties were either statistically similar to or higher than those of the farmer-chosen controls. Our study also revealed a year-to-year progressive adoption rate for the introduced varieties. The study suggests that the widescale introduction and popularization of climate-resilient varieties can ensure higher productivity and climate risk adaptation.

The objective of the study was to assess the genetic variability, drought tolerance behavior, and identify promising breeding lines for different rice ecologies and drought breeding programs. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) analysis using the mixed model approach revealed a considerable genetic variation in the population for yield and yield contributing traits in non-stress and drought-stress conditions. We observed very high heritability for all the selected traits under stress 2015 WS (73.8% to 85.3%) and 2016 WS (72.4% to 93.5%) and non-stress 2015 WS (68.2% To 92.9%) and 2016 WS (61.4% to 92.6%) environments, indicating possible selection for grain yield under drought stress and non-stress with the same precision level. None of the secondary traits except harvest index and biomass included in our study showed a positive association with grain yield, indicating indirect selection’s ineffectiveness in improving yield under drought.

To address this, marker-assisted intercross (IC) breeding involving multiple donors was used to combine three BB resistance genes—xa5, xa13 and Xa21, two blast resistance genes—Pi9 and Pi54, two BPH resistance genes—Bph20 and Bph21, and four drought tolerant quantitative trait loci (QTL)—qDTY1.1, qDTY2.1, qDTY3.1 and qDTY12.1—in the genetic background of the elite Indian rice cultivar ‘Krishna Hamsa’. Three cycles of selective intercrossing followed by selfing coupled with foreground selection and phenotyping for the target traits resulted in the development of 196 introgression lines (ILs) with a myriad of gene/QTL combinations. Based on the phenotypic reaction, the ILs were classified into seven phenotypic classes of resistance/tolerance to the following: (1) BB, blast and drought—5 ILs; (2) BB and blast—10 ILs; (3) BB and drought—9 ILs; (4) blast and drought—42 ILs; (5) BB—3 ILs; (6) blast—84 ILs; and (7) drought—43 ILs; none of the ILs were resistant to BPH. Positive phenotypic response (resistance) was observed to both BB and blast in 2 ILs, BB in 9 ILs and blast in 64 ILs despite the absence of corresponding R genes.

To ameliorate this issue, marker-assisted forward breeding (MAFB) coupled with a simultaneous crossing approach was used to combine three drought tolerant quantitative trait loci (QTL)—qDTY1.1, qDTY3.1, and qDTY12.1— four BLB genes—Xa4, xa5, xa13, and Xa21—and one blast-resistance gene, Pi9, in the elite rice cultivar Lalat. The introgression lines (ILs) developed in the current study were phenotypically screened for drought, BLB, and blast resistance at the F7– F8 generation. Under the reproductive stage (RS) drought stress, the yield advantage of ILs, with major-effect QTL (qDTY) over elite parent Lalat, ranges from 9 to 124% in DS2019 and from 7 to 175% in WS2019.

Inbreds derived from different cycles of the Drought Tolerant Population (DTP) and La Posta Sequia (LPS) were mated to a tester (CML550), and resulting hybrids were evaluated under managed water-deficit stress and well-watered conditions. The difference in yield between water-deficit and well-watered treatments was 27% and 36% for the DTP and LPS, respectively. Genetic gain for grain yield across cycles for the two populations was confirmed in the study. Genetic gain was observed for both treatments indicating that selection for water-deficit stress tolerance simultaneously improves grain yield in well-watered conditions. The DTP population had a genetic gain of 0.07 t ha−1 cycle−1, while the LPS had 0.16 t ha−1 cycle−1 under water-deficit conditions. Significant genetic gain was also observed in the well-watered treatments for both populations. Anthesis to silking interval was significantly reduced under water-deficit stress conditions in both populations. Plant and ear height were reduced in the LPS population in both treatments, while no reductions were observed for the trait in the DTP population. Potential water-deficit stress tolerance donor lines with yields comparable to commercial check varieties were identified."
738,INIT-01,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Genomic prediction of drought tolerance during seedling stage in maize using low-cost molecular markers,"Drought tolerance in maize is a complex and polygenic trait, especially in the seedling stage. In plant breeding, complex genetic traits can be improved by genomic selection (GS), which has become a practical and effective breeding tool. In the present study, a natural maize population named Northeast China core population (NCCP) consisting of 379 inbred lines were genotyped with diversity arrays technology (DArT) and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) platforms. Target traits of seedling emergence rate (ER), seedling plant height (SPH), and grain yield (GY) were evaluated under two natural drought stress environments in northeast China. Adequate genetic variations were observed for all the target traits, but they were divergent across environments. Similarly, the heritability of the target trait also varied across years and environments, the heritabilities in 2019 (0.88, 0.82, 0.85 for ER, SPH, GY) were higher than those in 2020 (0.65, 0.53, 0.33) and cross-2-years (0.32, 0.26, 0.33). In total, three marker datasets, 11,865 SilicoDArT markers obtained from the DArT-seq platform, 7837 SNPs obtained from the DArT-seq platform, and 91,003 SNPs obtained from the GBS platform, were used for GS analysis after quality control. The results of phylogenetic trees showed that broad genetic diversity existed in the NCCP population. Genomic prediction results showed that the average prediction accuracies estimated using the DArT SNP dataset under the two-fold cross-validation scheme were 0.27, 0.19, and 0.33, for ER, SPH, and GY, respectively. The result of SilicoDArT is close to the SNPs from DArT-seq, those were 0.26, 0.22, and 0.33. For the trait with lower heritability, the prediction accuracy can be improved using the dataset filtered by linkage disequilibrium. For the same trait, the prediction accuracies estimated with two DArT marker datasets were consistently higher than that estimated with the GBS SNP dataset under the same genotyping cost. The prediction accuracy was improved by controlling population structure and marker quality, even though the marker density was reduced. The prediction accuracies were improved by more than 30% using the significant-associated SNPs. Due to the complexity of drought tolerance under the natural stress environments, multiple years of data need to be accumulated to improve prediction accuracy by reducing genotype-by-environment interaction. Modeling genotype-by-environment interaction into genomic prediction needs to be further developed for improving drought tolerance in maize. The results obtained from the present study provides valuable pathway for improving drought tolerance in maize using GS.","ZHANG, Xuecai (CIMMYT) <XC.Zhang@cgiar.org>",(0) Not targeted,(2) Principal,NA,0,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,CIMMYT,NA,"• [INIT-01] Genomics-supported RSS schemes, optimized breeding pipelines and pipeline structure",• Not Linked,• Not Linked,• Not Linked,"• CAAS - Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences [Innovation] - China

The estimated genetic trends can act as a guideline to target the appropriate breeding strategies and optimize the breeding program for improved genetic gains. In this study, 17 years of historical data from IRRI's rice drought breeding program was used to estimate the genetic trends and assess the breeding program's success. We also identified top-performing lines based on grain yield breeding values as an elite panel for implementing future population improvement-based breeding schemes. A two-stage approach of pedigree-based mixed model analysis was used to analyze the data and extract the breeding values and estimate the genetic trends for grain yield under non-stress, drought, and in combined data of non-stress and drought. Lower grain yield values were observed in all the drought trials. Heritability for grain yield estimates ranged between 0.20 and 0.94 under the drought trials and 0.43-0.83 under non-stress trials. Under non-stress conditions, the genetic gain of 0.21% (10.22 kg/ha/year) for genotypes and 0.17% (7.90 kg/ha/year) for checks was observed. The genetic trend under drought conditions exhibited a positive trend with the genetic gain of 0.13% (2.29 kg/ha/year) for genotypes and 0.55% (9.52 kg/ha/year) for checks. For combined analysis showed a genetic gain of 0.27% (8.32 kg/ha/year) for genotypes and 0.60% (13.69 kg/ha/year) for checks was observed.

822,INIT-18,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Impact of historical climate variability on rice production in Mainland Southeast Asia across multiple scales,"Climate change is expected to put significant pressure on global food production. Although previous work has explored impacts of climate, management, and genetics on food production, additional research is needed to examine the effects of large-scale climate modes at local and regional scales. This study explores the impact of climate variability on rice yield in Mainland Southeast Asia from 1961 to 2017 at three different spatial scales: the whole Mainland Southeast Asia region, country-level (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam), and province-level for Vietnam. Annual rice yields over this period have nearly tripled with Vietnam experiencing the largest increases. Correlations between annual rice yield anomalies at the regional and country levels and climate data reveal clear influences of tropical climate variability associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Meridional Mode. At the provincial level in Vietnam, many provinces show similar correlation patterns for the spring-summer season of rice (e.g., a co-occurring La Niña and positive phase of the Pacific Meridional Mode in the preceding boreal winter and spring are associated with increased yields in spring-summer rice). However, the late summer-fall season rice yield anomalies show much weaker correlations with tropical climate patterns. Variations across provinces were also noted, particularly between the Red River and Mekong River Deltas. The history of this 56-year period, which included the Vietnam-American War and changes in land management policies, makes it challenging to disentangle the effects of climate variability and social factors on rice yields in these areas. However, these results highlight the importance of using a multidisciplinary and multiscale approach to help inform local and regional decision-making.",NA,(0) Not targeted,(2) Principal,NA,0,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,IRRI,NA,• [INIT-18] 5.2 Climate action plans,"• Resilient Agrifood Systems

899,INIT-32,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Understanding variability in carbon footprint of smallholder dairy farms in the central highlands of Ethiopia,"Smallholder dairy farms face enormous challenges in increasing milk production while mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thereby enhancing climate resilience. The carbon footprint (CF) of smallholder milk production is expected to increase with increasing demand for dairy products under the business-as-usual scenario. This study estimates the carbon footprint of smallholder milk production and examines variation across farms using data from 480 households to identify viable options for mitigating GHG emissions. We applied a cradle to farm-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to examine the effects of farming systems on GHG emission intensities across intensification gradients of smallholder farms (SHF) from four potential dairy districts in the central highlands of Ethiopia. According to our findings, enteric fermentation was the primary source of GHG emissions, and methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management accounted for the majority of total emissions across farms. The estimated average CF varies depending on farming systems, global warming potential (GWP), and allocation methods used. When GHG emissions were allocated to multiple products using economic allocation and based on IPCC (2007) and IPCC (2014) GWPs, the overall average CF of milk production was 1.91 and 2.35 kg CO2e/kg fat and protein-corrected milk (FPCM), respectively. On average, milk accounted for 72% of total greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of farm typology, rural SHF systems produced significantly more CF per kg of milk than urban and peri-urban SHF systems. Variations in milk yield explained more than half of the variation in GHG emissions intensity at the farm level. Feed digestibility and feed efficiency had a negative and significant (P < 0.01) association with CF of SHF. Our findings suggested that improving feed digestibility and feed efficiency by increasing the proportion of concentrate and improved forage as well as chemically upgrading straw and crop residue could provide an opportunity to both increase milk yield and reduce the CF of milk production of SHF in the study area. Supporting SHF to realize strategies contributing to climate-resilient dairy development require interventions at several levels in the dairy value chain.",NA,(0) Not targeted,(2) Principal,NA,0,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,CIAT (Alliance),NA,• [INIT-32] 2.3  More robust GHG emission and mitigation data,• Systems Transformation,• Climate Adaptation and Mitigation,• Goal 13: Climate Action,"• AAU - Addis Ababa University [Innovation] - Ethiopia

When GHG emissions were allocated to multiple products using economic allocation and based on IPCC (2007) and IPCC (2014) GWPs, the overall average CF of milk production was 1.91 and 2.35 kg CO2e/kg fat and protein-corrected milk (FPCM), respectively. On average, milk accounted for 72% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Our findings suggested that improving feed digestibility and feed efficiency by increasing the proportion of concentrate and improved forage as well as chemically upgrading straw and crop residue could provide an opportunity to both increase milk yield and reduce the CF of milk production of SHF in the study area. Supporting SHF to realize strategies contributing to climate-resilient dairy development require interventions at several levels in the dairy value chain.",On GHG emissions,Livestock and dairy,"Smallholder dairy farms face enormous challenges in increasing milk production while mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thereby enhancing climate resilience. The carbon footprint (CF) of smallholder milk production is expected to increase with increasing demand for dairy products under the business-as-usual scenario. This study estimates the carbon footprint of smallholder milk production and examines variation across farms using data from 480 households to identify viable options for mitigating GHG emissions. We applied a cradle to farm-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to examine the effects of farming systems on GHG emission intensities across intensification gradients of smallholder farms (SHF) from four potential dairy districts in the central highlands of Ethiopia. According to our findings, enteric fermentation was the primary source of GHG emissions, and methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management accounted for the majority of total emissions across farms. The estimated average CF varies depending on farming systems, global warming potential (GWP), and allocation methods used. When GHG emissions were allocated to multiple products using economic allocation and based on IPCC (2007) and IPCC (2014) GWPs, the overall average CF of milk production was 1.91 and 2.35 kg CO2e/kg fat and protein-corrected milk (FPCM), respectively. On average, milk accounted for 72% of total greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of farm typology, rural SHF systems produced significantly more CF per kg of milk than urban and peri-urban SHF systems. Variations in milk yield explained more than half of the variation in GHG emissions intensity at the farm level. Feed digestibility and feed efficiency had a negative and significant (P < 0.01) association with CF of SHF. Our findings suggested that improving feed digestibility and feed efficiency by increasing the proportion of concentrate and improved forage as well as chemically upgrading straw and crop residue could provide an opportunity to both increase milk yield and reduce the CF of milk production of SHF in the study area. Supporting SHF to realize strategies contributing to climate-resilient dairy development require interventions at several levels in the dairy value chain."

Adoption of improved or diverse seed varieties is a promising strategy to achieve increased yields, support food security and reduce poverty under climate change in East Africa. However, rigorous impact evaluations linking the contributions of improved seeds to the welfare of households have been

limited. This paper evaluates the impact of diversified seed systems on farm household production, sales, income, consumption and seed storage in Kenya and Uganda. It applies four-cell analysis to explore the intra-specific diversity of crops within farming systems, using primary data obtained from a random sampling of 207 treatment households and 87 control households. Propensity score matching was used to investigate the relationship between adoption of improved seeds and changes

in production, sales, income, consumption, seed storage and food security. Econometric results indicate that treatment households using improved seeds saw a significant positive impact on income from bean seed sales, sorghum and millet consumption, bean livestock feed and maize and millet seed stored.

94,INIT-28,Initiative output,Knowledge product,Evaluation of managed aquifer recharge in the Central Highlands of Vietnam,"Study region: Dak Lak province in the Central Highlands of Vietnam

Study focus: Intensification of agriculture has resulted in unsustainably high levels of groundwater use in the Central Highlands. High monsoonal rainfall provides opportunities to boost groundwater storage through managed aquifer recharge (MAR), yet experience with MAR in the region is absent. In response, five farm-scale pilots were implemented in collaboration with local farmers whereby runoff from roofs and fields was recharged into shallow dug wells. The pilots were closely monitored over three years.

New hydrological insights for the region: MAR pilots exhibited large contrasts in performance, with volumes recharged ranging from 5 to 530 m3 per year. Pilot sites with cleaner roof runoff water performed best, whilst those using more turbid water from unpaved roads performed worst. Water quality analyses did not identify parameters of major concern for irrigation. Field data and modelling indicate that the size of the recharge water plumes are small relative to the high groundwater velocities making the recharge water difficult to recover from the recharge well in this setting. Water is however contained locally, providing potential for improved water availability within the local area. Farmer attitudes towards MAR vary in response to the technical performance and a range of socioeconomic factors. These findings may provide insights for researchers or practitioners from other regions where groundwater dependence is high but experience in MAR is lacking.",Paul Pavelic,(0) Not targeted,(2) Principal,NA,0,NA,No,NA,NA,"• More coffee with less water - towards a reduction of the blue water footprint in coffee production
