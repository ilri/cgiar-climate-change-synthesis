Water saving technologies such as Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) allow sustaining production levels under reduced water availability. Before implementing such innovations on a large scale, their hydrological impact on the system needs to be assessed.  This study investigated the applicability of the water management tool WEAP (Water Evaluation and Planning System) for evaluating the effects of AWD on water use and water resources at field and irrigation system level for two different case studies in Central Luzon, the Philippines.  In the first study, the Zeigler Experiment Station (ZES) of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was used for parameterization of WEAP and field-scale assessment of AWD, making use of the availability of spatially and temporally highly resolved data. In the second study, WEAP was applied to an irrigation scheme in the Philippines, the Angat-Maasim River Irrigation System (AMRIS) to assess effects on up- and downstream water resources using lower resolution data.  Simulated AWD implementation during the dry season reduced water requirements by 12–27% and 34.3% on ZES and AMRIS, respectively. Additionally, AWD implementation enhanced streamflow in main and lateral canals, and thus increased water availability in the entire irrigation system. We also conducted an ex-ante assessment of future freshwater availability assuming reduced precipitation due to climate change effects alongside with irrigation supply at current levels. WEAP showed that water levels in the reservoir will substantially decline under these circumstances leading to severe water stress in AMRIS. Implementing AWD in such a scenario improved water availability in the system by up to 50%. WEAP proved to be a suitable tool for upscaling different irrigation techniques and assessing their impact on water resources on a large scale. Limitations of the approach and future possibilities for improvements are discussed.

	0168-9452	Lenaerts, Bert	Review: Improving global food security through accelerated plant breeding	Elsevier BV	Plant Science	2019	(e-first copy); 110207 (36 pages).	With an expected 9 billion people by 2050 and average income on the rise in the developing world, meeting future food demand will be a challenge. Climate change, urbanisation and land degradation are putting further pressure on the food supply. The multifaceted and self-reinforcing nature of these challenges calls for a fundamental transformation of the food system. In the past, crop improvement through breeding has been the major tool to lift people out of poverty and increase global food supply. To adequately address these food security challenges, new improved crop varieties need to be developed and reach farmers sooner as a partial solution. In this review, we focus on various proven conventional and biotechnological accelerating plant breeding methods that do not require genetic engineering or gene editing. We pay specific attention to the feasibility for implementation by national agricultural research systems in developing countries in the short term. We argue that postponing technologies that can accelerate breeding makes no economic sense and warrant immediate adoption of accelerated breeding practices in the public sector. Considering a wide range of factors including the economics of accelerated breeding, we advocate the use of a method called rapid generation advance (RGA) as the most feasible method for accelerating breeding in the public sector.

Dissemination pathways for drought-tolerant rice cultivars: A farmer-participatory evaluation in the Philippines	Elsevier BV	World Development Perspectives	2019	volume 15, no. 100131; 6 pages	The sustainability of agroecosystems in Asia is threatened by the impacts of climate change and decreasing rural population. This study sought to identify promising approaches to technology dissemination for smallholder farmers in unfavorable rice environments. We compared farmer-participatory methods for the dissemination of new stress-tolerant rice cultivars in drought-prone areas in the Philippines from 2016 to 2018. The study, involving 10,176 farmers, compared on-farm demonstration-cum-participatory varietal selection, farmer field schools, farmer-to-farmer extension through local farmer technicians, seed systems enhancement, and seed caravans. Responses were recorded from 386 farmers in a random sample to determine which approach best reflected their opinion on dissemination pathways. Socio-demographic characteristics influencing the farmers’ preferences for dissemination pathways were also assessed. Overall, technology demonstration was the preferred pathway, followed by farmer field schools and the farmer-to-farmer extension. Women favored farmer-to-farmer extension more than men did. Membership of a farmer association enhanced preference for farmer-to-farmer extension and seed caravans. These results can be used to guide the choice of appropriate pathways for the dissemination of new rice cultivars depending on the socio-demographic characteristics of the target farming communities.

Resource scarcity has direct and indirect impacts on nutrition, human health, and well-being of mostly poor rural communities. Climate change impacts in the region are manifesting through low crop yields, upsurge of vector borne diseases (malaria and dengue fever), and water and food-borne diseases (cholera and diarrhoea). This study applied a water–energy–food (WEF) nexus analytical livelihoods model with complex systems understanding to assess rural livelihoods, health, and well-being in southern Africa, recommending tailor-made adaptation strategies for the region aimed at building resilient rural communities. The WEF nexus is a decision support tool that improves rural livelihoods through integrated resource distribution, planning, and management, and ensures inclusive socio-economic transformation and development, and addresses related sustainable development goals, particularly goals 2, 3, 6 and 7. The integrated WEF nexus index for the region was calculated at 0.145, which is marginally sustainable, and indicating the region’s exposure to vulnerabilities, and reveals a major reason why the region fails to meet its developmental targets. The integrated relationship among WEF resources in southern Africa shows an imbalance and uneven resource allocation, utilisation and distribution, which normally results from a ‘siloed’ approach in resource management. The WEF nexus provides better adaptation options, as it guides decision making processes by identifying priority areas needing intervention, enhancing synergies, and minimising trade-offs necessary for resilient rural communities. Our results identified (i) the trade-offs and unintended negative consequences for poor rural households’ livelihoods of current silo approaches, (ii) mechanisms for sustainably enhancing household water, energy and food security, whilst (iii) providing direction for achieving SDGs 2, 3, 6 and 7	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)		Crossref	Chivenge, Pauline Paidamoyo;Liphadzi, Stanley;Modi, Albert Thembinkosi;Mpandeli, Sylvester;Naidoo, Dhesigen;Nhamo, Luxon;Nhemachena, Charles;Senzanje, Aidan;Slotow, Rob;Sobratee, Nafisa	https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16162970	https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ABBEO30J4IseBS2k2YzrAo9FCmT0wgk/view	View the full text	lcc	JA

Targeting management practices for rice yield gains in stress-prone environments of Myanmar	Elsevier BV	Field Crops Research	2019	volume 244, no. 107631; 12 pages	Rice in Myanmar is grown in diverse environments, including inland dry zone and salt-affected coastal deltas. This study evaluated management options that could improve productivity and reduce risks of rice crop in stress-prone areas of the country. We selected four sites from two regions in the central dry zone (Wundwin) and the Ayeyarwady delta (Labutta, Bogale and Mawlamyinegyun). We used experimental and survey datasets on farmers’ practices and rice yields from 2012 to 2014 to run the ORYZA model to simulate the climatic yield potential (YP; yield without stress) and the attainable yield under rainfed conditions (YW; yield limited by water), saline conditions (YS; yield limited by salinity), and under conditions of current farmers’ practices (YF; yield in farmers’ practices). Simulated yield responses to different management practices showed spatial variability within and among the selected sites. YP ranged from 5.4 to 11.1 t ha−1, YW ranged from 0.5 to 7.5 t ha−1, and YF ranged from 2.2 to 4.2 t ha−1. In salt-affected areas, average YS ranged from less than 0.1 t ha-1 to 5.6 t ha−1. Yield gains with the choice of an improved variety and adjusted sowing date were estimated at up to 53% above YF. Changing the time of sowing and using improved rice varieties provided the greatest yield gains in salt-affected and drought-prone areas where YF was the least. In areas where YF was greater, the improvement of nitrogen management provided larger benefits than in areas with lower YF. We conclude that an integrated approach using remote-sensing technologies, crop modeling, and a geographic information system is valuable for targeting the best management options to close the yield gap in unfavorable rice environments in Asia.

	1932-6203	Tan Yen, Bui	Modeling ENSO impact on rice production in the Mekong River Delta	Public Library of Science (PLoS)	PLoS ONE	2019	volume 14, no. 10; e0223884 (19 p.).	The Mekong River Delta is the rice production hub in South-east Asia and has a key role in determining rice prices in the world market. The increasing variability in the local climate due to global climate changes and the increasing severity of the ENSO phenomenon threatens rice production in the region, which has consequences for local and global food security. Though existing mapping efforts delineate the consequences of saline water intrusion during El Niño and flooding events during La Niña in the basin, research to predict future impacts in rice production is rather limited. The current work uses ORYZA, an ecophysiological model, combined with historical climate data, climate change scenarios RCP4.5 and 8.5 and climate-related risk maps to project the aggregate productivity and rice production impacts by the year 2050. Results show that in years of average salinity intrusion and flooding, the winter-spring rice crop in the MRD would experience an average annual decrease of 720,450 tons for 2020–2050 under the RCP4.5 scenario compared to the baseline of 2005–2016 average and another 1.17 million tons under the RCP8.5 scenario. The autumn-winter crop would decrease by 331,480 tons under RCP4.5 and 462,720 tons under RCP8.5. In years of severe salinity intrusion and flooding, the winter-spring rice crop would decrease by 2.13 million tons (10.29% lower than the projection for an average year) under RCP4.5 and 2.5 million tons (13.62%) under RCP8.5. Under severe conditions, the autumn-winter crop would have an average decrease of 1.3 million tons (7.36%) under RCP4.5 and 1.4 million tons (10.88%) for the RCP8.5 scenario. Given that most of the rice produced in this area is exported, a decline in rice supply at this scale would likely have implications on the global market price of rice affecting global food security. Such decline will also have implications for the rural economy and food security of Vietnam. Suggestions for corrective measures to reduce the impacts are briefly discussed.

The projected adverse impact of climate change on food grain production of tropical and subtropical latitudes necessitates the development of suitable agro-adaptations. We used open top chamber (OTC) experimental facility and simulation analysis to study the effect of elevated [CO2] with varying nutrients management on rice grain yield and to evaluate planting time adjustment as adaptation to climate change. The OTC experiments with ambient [CO2] level ([CO2] ~390 ppm) and elevated [CO2] (25% higher than the ambient) using cultivar ‘Swarna sub1 (140–145 days)’ were conducted during wet season of the years 2011 and 2012 at West Medinipur, India. Using CERES model, we simulated rice grain yield for future climate scenario (A1B) during the years 2020 (2010–2039) and 2080 (2071–2099) at four selected locations of the subtropical India. The elevated [CO2] in OTC increased panicle number, but decreased filled grain number per panicle, 1000-grain weight and grain yield. The increasing [CO2] had smaller adverse impact for integrated nutrients management as compared with chemical fertiliser. The model simulated grain yield reduction of 6.1−13.0% during 2020 and 14.4 −25.0% during 2080 with rising temperature 1.6 and 4.6°C, respectively, compared with the base period (1961–1990). Early planting during 25 June to 25 July received closure favourable temperature and rainfall during the crop growing period, hence had better adaptation to the climate change. Increasing dose of integrated nutrients and early planting is expected to minimise the adverse impact of climate change on rice production of the subtropical India.

	2077-0472	Sembiring, Hasil	Yield gap management under seawater intrusion areas of Indonesia to improve rice productivity and resilience to climate change	MDPI AG	Agriculture	2019	Volume 10 no. 1; 10 pages.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate (a) the performance of two modern rice varieties (non-tolerant and tolerant for saline soils) under different fertilizer management options, and (b) assess the yield gap and income increase through proper crop and nutrient management at different levels of soil salinity. Experiments were carried out in moderate and high levels of soil salinity in West Java, Indonesia. A split plot design with three replications was used. The main plots included two rice varieties, Inpari-30 Ciherang sub1 and Inpari-34 (tolerant variety for saline soils), and subplots included eight fertilizer management treatments. Farmer participatory field trials were also established across three levels of soil salinity with four different rice varieties, Sidenuk, Inpari 30, Inpari 34, and Inpari 35, and a fertilizer package consisting of organic and inorganic fertilizers. Under low and moderate soil salinities, Sidenuk and Inpari 30 with recommended practice had higher productivity and economic benefit compared to the saline tolerant rice varieties, Inpari 34 and Inpari 35. However, under high soil salinity, the yields of Inpari 34 and Inpari 35 with recommended practice were 93% higher than farmers’ practice, representing an exploitable yield gap of 1.3 t ha−1 and benefit above fertilizer cost of USD 301 ha−1. The combination of tolerant varieties and improved nutrient management use for rice production can therefore be used as a strategy for improving farmers’ income and livelihoods in coastal areas of Indonesia.

"Purpose: In recent years, climate-smart agriculture (CSA) was introduced to Vietnam to enhance farmers’ resilience and adaptation to climate change. Among the climate-smart agricultural technologies (CSATs) introduced were water-saving techniques and improved stress tolerant varieties. This study aims to examine the determinants of farmers’ adoption of these technologies and the effects of their adoption on net rice income (NRI) in three provinces as follows: Thai Binh (North), Ha Tinh (Central) and Bac Lieu (South). Design/methodology/approach:  Determinants of adoption of CSATs and the adoption effects on NRI are analyzed by using a multinomial endogenous switching regression framework. Findings: The results showed that gender, age, number of family workers, climate-related factors, farm characteristics, distance to markets, access to climate information, confidence on the know-how of extension workers, membership in social/agricultural groups and attitude toward risk were the major factors affecting the decision to adopt CSATs. However, the effects of these factors on the adoption of CSATs varied across three provinces. These technologies when adopted tend to increase NRI but the increase is much greater when these are combined.   <jats:title content-type=""abstract-subheading"">Practical implications It is important to consider first the appropriateness of the CSA packages to the specific conditions of the target areas before they are promoted. It is also necessary to enhance the technical capacity of local extension workers and provide farmers more training on CSATs. Originality/value: This study is the first attempt to identify key determinants of adoption of CSATs either singly or in combination and the adoption effects on NRI in Vietnam"	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Development;Geography, Planning and Development;Global and Planetary Change;Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	Nguyen, Dinh Tien;Nong, Nguyen Khanh Ngoc;Ole Sander, Bjoern;Rañola,, Roberto F.;Reiner, Wassmann	https://doi.org/10.1108/ijccsm-01-2019-0003	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xdoFduywwS6zJeSysbv3UJJcM-98JQY-/view	View the full text	lcc	JA

Reduced crop yields will lead to higher food prices and increased hardship for low income populations, especially in urban areas. Action on climate change is one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 13) and is linked to the Paris Climate Agreement. The research challenge posed by climate change is so complex that a trans-disciplinary response is required, one that brings together researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers in networks where the lines between “research” and “development” become deliberately blurred. Fostering such networks will require researchers, throughout the world, not only to work across disciplines but also to pursue new South–North and South–South partnerships incorporating policy-makers and practitioners. We use our diverse research experiences to describe the emergence of such networks, such as the Direct Seeded Rice Consortium (DSRC) in South and Southeast Asia, and to identify lessons on how to facilitate and strengthen the development of trans-disciplinary responses to climate change	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)		Crossref	Balie, Jean;Chivenge, Pauline;Cobb, Joshua;Connor, Melanie;Fisher, Eleanor;Gummert, Martin;Kohli, Ajay;Krupnik, Timothy J.;Kumar, Virender;Nelson, Katherine;Puskur, Ranjitha;Sander, Bjoern Ole;Setiyono, Tri;Yadav, Sudhir	https://doi.org/10.3390/cli8020035	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PS47b-AlyWV3xp1eXiokffJrZeYN4TRI/view	View the full text	lcc	JA

Previous efforts to increase the yield of tropical rice have focused on medium‐duration varieties. However, there is increasing demand for high‐yielding short‐duration varieties that can adapt to intensified cropping systems and climate change. Our goal was to identify physiological traits associated with high yield in elite short‐duration genotypes suitable for tropical Asia. We conducted field experiments in five consecutive growing seasons at the International Rice Research Institute, Philippines. We selected genotypes in the first two seasons, then performed detailed characterization of the most promising genotypes in the following three seasons. Of the 50 advanced‐generation genotypes, three had consistently high yield and early maturity, with yields 11% to 38% higher than that of IRRI104 (IR50404‐57‐2‐2‐3), a short‐duration variety that is most widely grown in Southeast Asia. These genotypes were 20 to 32 cm taller than IRRI104. We found that low source capacity, defined as stem nonstructural carbohydrates at heading plus biomass accumulation after heading, for grain growth was the major factor for low yield of IRRI104. Although sink capacity (spikelets m−2 × grain weight) in the promising genotypes were comparable to that of IRRI104, they had 25% to 53% higher source‐to‐sink ratio (source capacity / sink capacity) than IRRI104, which was attributed to larger leaf area and greater biomass accumulation during the grain‐filling stage. This result suggests that slight changes in plant development to promote height combined with increased leaf area around heading would improve the yield of short‐duration rice varieties in tropical Asia.

Global climate change is having a strong negative effect on rice production. One of the climatic factors impacting rice yield is asymmetric warming, i.e., the stronger increase in nighttime as compared to daytime temperatures. Little is known of the metabolic responses of rice to high night temperature (HNT) in the field. Eight rice cultivars with contrasting HNT sensitivity were grown in the field during the wet (WS) and dry season (DS) in the Philippines. Plant height, 1000-grain weight and harvest index were influenced by HNT in both seasons, while total grain yield was only consistently reduced in the WS. Metabolite composition was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). HNT effects were more pronounced in panicles than in flag leaves. A decreased abundance of sugar phosphates and sucrose, and a higher abundance of monosaccharides in panicles indicated impaired glycolysis and higher respiration-driven carbon losses in response to HNT in the WS. Higher amounts of alanine and cyano-alanine in panicles grown in the DS compared to in those grown in the WS point to an improved N-assimilation and more effective detoxification of cyanide, contributing to the smaller impact of HNT on grain yield in the DS.

	2225-1154	Vo, Thi Bach Thuong	Methane emission factors from Vietnamese rice production: Pooling data of 36 field sites for meta-analysis	MDPI AG	Climate	2020	Volume 8, no. 74; page 1-19.	Rice production is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the national budget of many Asian countries, but the extent of emissions varies strongly across agro-environmental zones. It is important to understand these differences in order to improve the national GHG inventory and effectively target mitigation options. This study presents a meta-analysis of CH4 database emission factors (EFs) from 36 field sites across the rice growing areas of Vietnam and covering 73 cropping seasons. The EFs were developed from field measurements using the closed chamber technique. The analysis for calculating baseline EFs in North, Central and South Vietnam in line with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 2 methodology was specified for the three cropping seasons being early-(E), mid-(M) and late-year (L) seasons. Calculated average CH4 EFs are given in kg ha−1 d−1 and reflect the distinct seasons in North (E: 2.21; L: 3.89), Central (E: 2.84; M+L: 3.13) and South Vietnam (E: 1.72; M: 2.80; L: 3.58). Derived from the available data of the edapho-hydrological zones of the Mekong River Delta, season-based EFs are more useful than zone-based EFs. In totality, these average EFs indicate an enormous variability of GHG emissions in Vietnamese rice production and represent much higher values than the IPCC default. Seasonal EFs from Vietnam exceeded IPCC defaults given for Southeast Asia corresponding to 160% (E), 240% (M) and 290% (L) of the medium value, respectively.;	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)		Crossref	Asch, Folkard;Bui, Thi Phuong Loan;Dinh, Quang Hieu;Mai, Van Trinh;Sander, Bjoern Ole;Vu, Duong Quynh;Vu, Thi Hang;Wassmann, Reiner;Yen, Bui Tan	https://doi.org/10.3390/cli8060074	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vTECNTH3Rc4Mm2DLTJv263SFVYgLhMO0/view	View the full text	lcc	JA

Weather extremes which are accelerated by changing climate greatly decrease agricultural productivity, resulting in severe economic losses and losses of livelihood of the poorest marginal communities. The adoption of stress-tolerant rice varieties (STRVs) is recommended as a best technology fix for risk adaptation. Although STRVs provide better outcomes with no yield penalty, farmers' decisions to adopt new STRVs are influenced by a multitude of factors, most importantly information exposure. We used a sequential logit model to analyze the impact of information access and information quality on adoption decisions regarding STRVs in flood-risk areas. Over the years, we found that STRVs adoption has become scale neutral, but adopters have significantly higher access to information. The estimates showed that 48 per cent of the farmers having access to information decided to adopt STRVs. When information reaches 50 per cent of the rice farmers in flood-prone areas, the estimated additional annual income is US	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Development;Economics and Econometrics;General Environmental Science	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	Ashok, Arathy;Raghu, Prabhakaran T.	https://doi.org/10.1017/s1355770x20000212	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aItLL9DyQBTgM_OQNuQhFgGqRAfxKYfm/view	View the full text	lcc	JA
	2077-0472	Sander, Björn Ole	Potential of alternate wetting and drying irrigation practices for the mitigation of GHG emissions from rice fields: Two cases in central Luzon (Philippines)	MDPI AG	Agriculture	2020	Volume 10, no. 8350; pages 1-19.	Reducing methane (CH4) emission from paddy rice production is an important target for many Asian countries in order to comply with their climate policy commitments. National greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory approaches like the Tier-2 approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are useful to assess country-scale emissions from the agricultural sector. In paddy rice, alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is a promising and well-studied water management technique which, as shown in experimental studies, can effectively reduce CH4 emissions. However, so far little is known about GHG emission rates under AWD when the technique is fully controlled by farmers. This study assesses CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes under continuous flooded (CF) and AWD treatments for seven subsequent seasons on farmers’ fields in a pumped irrigation system in Central Luzon, Philippines. Under AWD management, CH4 emissions were substantially reduced (73% in dry season (DS), 21% in wet season (WS)). In all treatments, CH4 is the major contributor to the total GHG emission and is, thus, identified as the driving force to the global warming potential (GWP). The contribution of N2O emissions to the GWP was higher in CF than in AWD, however, these only offset 15% of the decrease in CH4 emission and, therefore, did not jeopardize the strong reduction in the GWP. The study proves the feasibility of AWD under farmers’ management as well as the intended mitigation effect. Resulting from this study, it is recommended to incentivize dissemination strategies in order to improve the effectiveness of mitigation initiatives. A comparison of single CH4 emissions to calculated emissions with the IPCC Tier-2 inventory approach identified that, although averaged values showed a sufficient degree of accuracy, fluctuations for single measurement points have high variation which limit the use of the method for field-level assessments.

	2073-4395	Lee, Jae-Sung	Advanced strategic research to promote the use of rice genetic resources	MDPI AG	Agronomy	2020	Volume 10 no. 1629; 14 p.	International genebanks have a collection of over 760 K conserved accessions of various plants, most of these accessions are within the multi-lateral system governed by the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA). However, in spite of the success in collection and conservation, only a small portion of the genetic diversity has been used in crop breeding programs. As climate change-induced new or enhanced constraints seriously hamper crop productions, researchers and breeders should be able to swiftly choose an appropriate set of genetic resources from the genebank and use them for improving crop varieties. Here, we present some advanced technologies that can effectively promote the use of diverse rice accessions held at national/international genebanks. High throughput phenotyping using multispectral imaging systems and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can quickly screen large numbers of accessions for various useful traits. Such data, when combined with that from the digital rice genebank consisting of genome sequencing data, will significantly increase the efficiency in breeding efforts. Recent genome sequencing data of the rice wild species will also add to the resources available for pre-breeding efforts such as the introgression of useful genes into modern rice varieties. We expect that these advanced technologies and strategies developed through the global rice research programs will be applicable for many closely related species as well.;	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)		Crossref	Chebotarov, Dmytro;Kohli, Ajay;McNally, Kenneth;Platten, John Damien	https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10111629	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sY3n9D1bHy11wpnQ3zopXAyXsV5NwAQF/view	View the full text	lcc	JA

The country has very limited agricultural land and cotton competes with other crops for this scarce land resource. On top of that, Bangladesh is regarded as a country where agriculture is highly vulnerable to the variabilities of weather patterns that result from climate change. Against this backdrop, to better understand the potential for the sustainable expansion of cotton production in Bangladesh, we examine cotton’s agricultural value chain and projected climate risks associated with different phases of the chain. We identified associated stakeholders at different phases of cotton production, engaged with them to understand climatic and non-climatic threats and developed an integrated set of recommendations for climate-risk management through improving the connection of producers to markets, increasing economic returns to small farmers, and improving efficiency along the value chain. We discussed our estimated climate projections with stakeholders to understand the challenges at different stages of production and marketing, and together explored and identified probable solutions. This research offers a new and evolving approach to assess climate change impact on agriculture utilizing a holistic approach, which could be adopted for other crops.;	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Geography, Planning and Development;Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law;Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	Bahadur, Aditya;Croxton, Simon;Huq, Saleemul;Pal, Uma;Rahman, Mahjabeen;Rashid, Md Bazlur	https://doi.org/10.3390/su13020574	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qhr3VKf04k6mjgAcyBH5jSWPKqeelLx5/view	View the full text	lcc	JA
	2071-1050	Dar, Manzoor H.	Abiotic stress tolerance-progress and pathways of sustainable rice production	MDPI AG	Sustainability	2021	Volume 13 no. 2078; pages 1-19.	Rice is globally a major food crop and its production has progressively been affected by various types of abiotic stresses especially drought, flooding, salinity, heat and cold in most of the cultivable rice ecosystems. The incidence, intensity and duration of these stresses are anticipated to aggravate due to climate change consequences, demanding resilient yields in these situations to be essential. Present paper deals with reviewing various types of abiotic stresses and their mitigation strategies for enhancing and stabilizing rice production in stress prone areas. Review of available literature pertaining to the study area has been used as research methodology for this paper. The available literature suggests that stress-tolerant varieties can serve as the most viable strategy to contribute in coping with the problem of abiotic stresses. Although, good progress has been made in the development of stress-tolerant rice varieties (STRVs) and incessant efforts are being made to spread these varieties in target areas, adoption by farmers is yet to meet expectations. Advantage, affordability, awareness and availability are the main factors responsible for adopting of any technology. The adoption of stress-tolerant varieties has not reached its potential, predominantly due to the lack of awareness and non-availability of seeds amongst farmers. Strategic and intentional collaborations should be ensured for scaling the sustainable delivery and diffusion of STRVs. A promotional roadmap that ensures the linkages between private and public seed sectors remains the key factor for its successful adoption. Similarly, strengthening of formal, informal and semi-formal seed systems is crucial to accelerate the dissemination of these varieties. There is an imperative need to create strategic plans for the development of varieties possessing multiple stress tolerance. Significant investments for sustainability of rice production in stress prone areas form the essential component of long-term agricultural development. The sooner these investments and strategies are accomplished, the greater the gains are expected.

Physiological mechanisms related to maintaining grain yield under high night temperature in rice	Wiley	Plant, Cell & Environment	2021		High night temperature (HNT) causes substantial yield loss in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this study, the physiological processes related to flag leaf dark respiration (Rn) and grain filling under HNT were explored in a multi‐parent advanced generation intercross population developed for heat tolerance (MAGICheat) along with selected high temperature tolerant breeding lines developed with heat‐tolerant parents. Within a subset of lines, flag leaf Rn under HNT treatment was related to lower spikelet number per panicle and thus reduced yield. HNT enhanced the night‐time reduction of non‐structural carbohydrates (NSC) in stem tissue, but not in leaves, and stem night‐time NSC reduction was negatively correlated with yield. Between heading and harvest, the major difference in NSC concentration was found for starch, but not for soluble sugar. HNT weakened the relationship between NSC remobilization and harvest index at both the phenotypic and genetic level. By using genome wide association studies (GWAS), an invertase inhibitor, MADS box transcription factors and a UDP‐glycosyltransferase that were identified as candidate genes orchestrating stem NSC remobilization in the control treatment were lost under HNT. With the identification of physiological and genetic components related to rice HNT response, this study offers promising prebreeding materials and trait targets to sustain yield stability under climate change	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Physiology;Plant Science	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	Henry, Amelia;Misra, Gopal;Sreenivasulu, Nese	https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.14046			lcc	JA

The delivery of gene editing reagents into the plant cells has been dominated by plasmid vectors delivered using agrobacterium or particle bombardment. This approach involves the production of genetically engineered plants, which need to undergo regulatory approvals. There are various reagent delivery approaches available that have enabled the delivery of DNA-free editing reagents. They invariably involve the use of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), especially in the case of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. The explant of choice for most of the non-DNA approaches utilizes protoplasts as the recipient explant. While the editing efficiency is high in protoplasts, the ability to regenerate individual plants from edited protoplasts remains a challenge. There are various innovative delivery approaches being utilized to perform in planta edits that can be incorporated in the germline cells or inherited via seed. With the modification and adoption of various novel approaches currently being used in animal systems, it seems likely that non-transgenic genome editing will become routine in higher plants	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Agronomy and Crop Science;Animal Science and Zoology;Biotechnology;Genetics	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	Bueno, Gela Myan;Dhingra, Amit;Ludwig, Yvonne;Slamet-Loedin, Inez H.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11248-021-00239-w			lcc	JA

The weather-rice-nutrient integrated decision support system (WeRise) is an information and communications technology (ICT)-based tool developed to improve rainfed rice productivity. It integrates localized seasonal climate prediction based on the statistical downscaling of the Scale Interaction Experiment-Frontier Research Center for Global Change (SINTEX-F) ocean-atmosphere coupled general circulation model and real-time weather data with a crop growth model (ORYZA), to provide advisories on the optimum sowing timing using suitable varieties. Field validations were conducted to determine the applicability of WeRise and SINTEX-F in North Sumatra and West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia, and Iloilo, Nueva Ecija and Tarlac, Philippines. Results showed that downscaled SINTEX-F outputs were applicable in these target provinces. Hindcast analysis using these outputs also showed a good model performance against locally observed historical weather data for both countries. Moreover, the on-farm experiments showed that higher grain yields were obtained using WeRise advisories on optimum sowing timing compared to the farmers’ sowing timings. Improved fertilizer recovery rates were also observed when WeRise advisories were followed. The results imply that WeRise can improve rainfed rice productivity in Southeast Asia. Further validation is recommended to determine its applicability in more countries of Southeast Asia.

High night temperatures (HNT) are shown to significantly reduce rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield and quality. A better understanding of the genetic architecture of HNT tolerance will help rice breeders to develop varieties adapted to future warmer climates. In this study, a diverse indica rice panel displayed a wide range of phenotypic variability in yield and quality traits under control night (24 °C) and higher night (29 °C) temperatures. Genome-wide association analysis revealed 38 genetic loci associated across treatments (18 for control and 20 for HNT). Nineteen loci were detected with the relative changes in the traits between control and HNT. Positive phenotypic correlations and co-located genetic loci with previously cloned grain size genes revealed common genetic regulation between control and HNT, particularly grain size. Network-based predictive models prioritized 20 causal genes at the genetic loci based on known gene/s expression under HNT in rice. Our study provides important insights for future candidate gene validation and molecular marker development to enhance HNT tolerance in rice.

	0040-5752	Heredia, Maria Cristina	Breeding rice for a changing climate by improving adaptations to water saving technologies	Springer Science and Business Media LLC	Theoretical and Applied Genetics	2021		Climate change is expected to increasingly affect rice production through rising temperatures and decreasing water availability. Unlike other crops, rice is a main contributor to greenhouse gas emissions due to methane emissions from flooded paddy fields. Climate change can therefore be addressed in two ways in rice: through making the crop more climate resilient and through changes in management practices that reduce methane emissions and thereby slow global warming. In this review, we focus on two water saving technologies that reduce the periods lowland rice will be grown under fully flooded conditions, thereby improving water use efficiency and reducing methane emissions. Rice breeding over the past decades has mostly focused on developing high-yielding varieties adapted to continuously flooded conditions where seedlings were raised in a nursery and transplanted into a puddled flooded soil. Shifting cultivation to direct-seeded rice or to introducing non-flooded periods as in alternate wetting and drying gives rise to new challenges which need to be addressed in rice breeding. New adaptive traits such as rapid uniform germination even under anaerobic conditions, seedling vigor, weed competitiveness, root plasticity, and moderate drought tolerance need to be bred into the current elite germplasm and to what extent this is being addressed through trait discovery, marker-assisted selection and population improvement are reviewed	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Biotechnology; Agronomy and Crop Science; Genetics; General Medicine	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	Kant, Josefine; Prodhan, M.

Hence, we investigated the responses of rice near-isogenic lines (NILs) that carry resistance genes against brown planthopper (BPH) under different environmental conditions.Results: We tested these NILs under three environmental settings (the atmospheric temperature with corresponding carbon dioxide at the ambient, year 2050 and year 2100) based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change prediction. Comparing between different environments, two of nine NILs that carried a single BPH-resistant gene maintained their resistance under the environmental changes, whereas two of three NILs showed gene pyramiding with two maintained BPH resistance genes despite the environmental changes. In addition, two NILs (NIL-BPH17 and NIL-BPH20) were examined in their antibiosis and antixenosis effects under these environmental changes. BPH showed different responses to these two NILs, where the inhibitory effect of NIL-BPH17 on the BPH growth and development was unaffected, while NIL-BPH20 may have lost its resistance during the environmental changes.                                Conclusion                 Our results indicate that BPH resistance genes could be affected by climate change.

		Juma, Roselyne U.	Identification of an elite core panel as a key breeding resource to accelerate the rate of genetic improvement for irrigated rice		Research Square Platform LLC	2021	[pre-print] 28 pages	Rice genetic improvement is a key component of achieving and maintaining food security in Asia and Africa in the face of growing populations and climate change. In this effort, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) continues to play a critical role in creating and disseminating rice varieties with higher productivity. Due to increasing demand for rice, especially in Africa, there is a strong need to accelerate the rate of genetic improvement for grain yield.In an effort to identify and characterize the elite breeding pool of IRRI’s irrigated rice breeding program, we analyzed 102 historical yield trials conducted in the Philippines during the period 2012-2016 and representing 15,286 breeding lines (including released varieties). A mixed model approach based on the pedigree relationship matrix was used to estimate breeding values for grain yield, which ranged from 2.12 to 6.27 t·ha-1. The rate of genetic gain for grain yield was estimated at 8.75 kg·ha-1·year-1 (0.23%) for crosses made in the period from 1964 to 2014. Reducing the data to only IRRI released varieties, the rate doubled to 17.36 kg·ha-1·year-1 (0.46%). Regressed against breeding cycle the rate of gain for grain yield was 185 kg·ha-1·cycle-1 (4.95%). We selected 72 top performing lines based on breeding values for grain yield to create an elite core panel (ECP) representing the genetic diversity in the breeding program with the highest heritable yield values from which new products can be derived. The ECP closely aligns with the indica 1B sub-group of Oryza sativa that includes most modern varieties for irrigated systems. Agronomic performance of the ECP under multiple environments in Asia and Africa confirmed its high yield potential.We found that the rate of genetic gain for grain yield found in this study was limited primarily by long cycle times and the direct introduction of non-improved material into the elite pool. Consequently, the current breeding scheme for irrigated rice at IRRI is based on rapid recurrent selection among highly elite lines. In this context, the ECP constitutes an important resource for IRRI and NAREs breeders to carefully characterize and manage that elite diversity.

However, few studies have investigated the extent to which these changes have impacted farm-level crop productivity, which is a key driver of food security and poverty in rainfed, low-input, rice-based systems. The objective of this study was to conduct an integrated assessment of variables related to socioeconomic status, farm characteristics, and crop management practices to understand the major factors influencing crop productivity and identify promising leverage points for sustainable development in coastal Bangladesh. Using a panel survey dataset of 32 variables from 502 farm households located within polder (coastal embankment) and outside polder systems during 2005–2015, we employed statistical factor analysis to characterize five independent latent factors named here as Farming Challenges, Economic Status, Crop Management Practices, Asset Endowment, and Farm Characteristics. The factor Farming Challenges explained the most variation among households (31%), with decreases observed over time, specifically households located outside polders. Individual variables contributing to this factor included perceived cyclone severity, household distance to main roads and input-output markets, cropping intensity, and access to extension services. The most important factors for increasing crop productivity on a household and per unit area basis were Asset Endowment and Crop Management Practices, respectively. The former highlights the need for increasing gross cropped area, which can be achieved through greater cropping intensity, while the latter was associated with increased fertilizer, labor, and pesticide input use. Despite the importance of these factors, household poverty trajectory maps showed that changes in off-farm income had played the strongest role in improving livelihoods in this coastal area. This study can help inform development efforts and policies for boosting farm-level crop productivity, specifically through agricultural intensification (higher cropping intensity combined with appropriate and efficient use of inputs) and expanding opportunities for off-farm income as key pathways to bring smallholder households out of poverty.

The diversity of plant genetic, crop management, and environmental conditions leads to a wide variation in the number of rice crops per year and the dates of crop establishment and harvesting across Asia. Asia-wide rice crop calendars exist (e.g., RiceAtlas) but are based on heterogeneous data sources with varying levels of detail and are challenging to update. Earth observations can contribute to consistent and replicable crop calendars. Here we demonstrate and validate a method for generating a rice crop calendar across Asia. Our analysis at administrative unit-level is based on pixel-level analysis with the PhenoRice algorithm using MODIS imagery (2003–16) to estimate start of season (SoS) and end of season (EoS) dates. PhenoRice outputs were post-processed to generate representative statistics on the number of rice crop seasons per year and their SoS/EoS dates per administrative unit across Asia, called RICA (a RIce crop Calendar for Asia). RICA SoS and EoS dates across all seasons correlated strongly with RiceAtlas crop establishment and harvesting dates (R2 of 0.88 and 0.82 respectively, n = 1,186). The mean absolute errors were around 26 and 33 days for SoS and EoS, respectively. A detailed assessment in the Philippines where data in RiceAtlas are particularly accurate had even better results (R2 of 0.93 and 0.85 respectively, n = 131). Comparisons to other published rice calendars also suggested that RICA captured rice cropping season dates well.

		Ye, Changrong	Marker assisted pyramiding of QTLs for heat tolerance and escape upgrades heat resilience in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Research Square Platform LLC	Research Square	2021		High temperature at flowering stage of rice causes low spikelet fertility and low yield. To cope with high temperature stress brought by climate change, two strategies were proposed to develop heat-resilient rice varieties. One is to escape the high temperature by flowering early in the morning, another is to enhance tolerance to high temperature stress per se. Two promising QTLs for early morning flowering (qEMF3) and heat tolerance (qHTSF4.1) were introgressed into IR64 background, and near isogenic lines (NILs) IR64+qEMF3 (IR64EMF3) and IR64+qHTSF4.1 (IR64HT4) were developed in previous studies. In this study, a QTL pyramiding line IR64+qHTSF4.1+qEMF3 (IR64HT4EMF3) was developed by marker assisted selection of the progenies of previous NILs. The NILs were subjected to different high temperature regimes in the indoor growth chambers and different locations in the field. In the indoor growth chambers, when high temperature starts early (before 11:00 am), IR64HT4 and IR64HT4EMF3 had higher spikelet fertility than IR64EMF3; when high temperature comes later (after 11:00 am), IR64EMF3 and IR64HT4EMF3 had higher spikelet fertility than IR64HT4. The flowering pattern of the IR64HT4EMF3 was earlier than IR64HT4, but similar to IR64EMF3 in the glasshouse, field and indoor growth chambers. IR64HT4EMF3 showed higher spikelet fertility than IR64EMF3 and IR64HT4 in the field in the Philippines. Thus, combination of early morning flowering and heat tolerance QTLs is an elegant breeding strategy to cope with future extreme climateOpen access	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)		Crossref	Ishimaru, Tsutomu; Lambio, Leslie; Li, Le; Long, Yu; He, Zhizhou; Htun, Than Myint; Tang, Shunxue; Su, Zhenxi	https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-982517/v1	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1goM_1Y9eWkt9lXGTpA1Nh6GIxS2uhwO2/view	View the full text	lcc	JA

As with other sectors of the economy, agriculture should also contribute to meeting countries’ emission reduction targets. Transformation of agriculture to low-carbon food systems requires much larger investments in low emission development options from global climate finance, domestic budgets, and the private sector. Innovative financing mechanisms and instruments that integrate climate finance, agriculture development budgets, and private sector investment can improve and increase farmers' and other value chain actors’ access to finance while delivering environmental, economic, and social benefits. Investment cases assessed in this study provide rich information to design and implement mitigation options in agriculture through unlocking additional sources of public and private capital, strengthening the links between financial institutions, farmers, and agribusiness, and coordination of actions across multiple stakeholders. These investment cases expand support for existing agricultural best practices, integrate forestry and agricultural actions to avoid land-use change, and support the transition to market-based solutionsOpen access	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health; General Environmental Science; Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	Sapkota, Tek B; Sander, Bojern O; Arango, Jacobo; Nelson, Katherine; Wilkes, Andreas	https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac3605	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1spbtfAm1_2E2rt2LB4nhRaocmsxcEUpE/view	View the full text	lcc	JA

Steady agronomic and genetic interventions are essential for sustaining productivity in intensive rice cropping	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	2021	Volume 118 no. 45 p. e2110807118	Intensive systems with two or three rice (Oryza sativa L.) crops per year account for about 50% of the harvested area for irrigated rice in Asia. Any reduction in productivity or sustainability of these systems has serious implications for global food security. Rice yield trends in the world’s longest-running long-term continuous cropping experiment (LTCCE) were evaluated to investigate consequences of intensive cropping and to draw lessons for sustaining production in Asia. Annual production was sustained at a steady level over the 50-y period in the LTCCE through continuous adjustment of management practices and regular cultivar replacement. Within each of the three annual cropping seasons (dry, early wet, and late wet), yield decline was observed during the first phase, from 1968 to 1990. Agronomic improvements in 1991 to 1995 helped to reverse this yield decline, but yield increases did not continue thereafter from 1996 to 2017. Regular genetic and agronomic improvements were sufficient to maintain yields at steady levels in dry and early wet seasons despite a reduction in the yield potential due to changing climate. Yield declines resumed in the late wet season. Slower growth in genetic gain after the first 20 y was associated with slower breeding cycle advancement as indicated by pedigree depth. Our findings demonstrate that through adjustment of management practices and regular cultivar replacement, it is possible to sustain a high level of annual production in irrigated systems under a changing climate. However, the system was unable to achieve further increases in yield required to keep pace with the growing global rice demandOpen access	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Multidisciplinary;Food security;Intensive cropping;Long term productivity trends	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	 Kohli, Ajay;Radanielson, Ando M.; Rutkoski, Jessica Elaine; Buresh, Roland J.; Dobermann, Achim; Angeles, Olivyn; Pabuayon, Irish Lorraine B.; Santos-Medellín, Christian; Fritsche-Neto, Roberto; Chivenge, Pauline	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2110807118	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GKgAz53m57PyuoeGaUFFtxuoAw9016g1/view	View the full text	lcc	JA
	2073-4395	Anwar, Md. Parvez	Weeds and their responses to management efforts in a changing climate	MDPI AG	Agronomy	2021	Volume 11 no. 10 p. 1921	Crop production is a constant battle with weeds, in which weeds, generally, are victorious. Therefore, rather than channeling our efforts into the development of a “silver bullet” to control weeds, the focus should be on sustainable weed management in both natural- and agro-ecosystems. However, sustainable weed management can be a challenge in the context of global climate change. Over the past few decades, global climate change, mostly indicated by phenomena such as increased atmospheric temperature and elevated CO2 levels, is evident due to human activities and natural events. These phenomena also affect regional/local climate, resulting in significant influences on the agricultural systems of a particular region. Rising CO2 levels may give comparative advantages to C3 plants through increased photosynthesis, biomass production and yield, compared to C4 plants. Plants with C4 photosynthetic pathways, on the other hand, are likely to benefit more from rising global temperatures than C3 plants. Thus, the differential responses of C3 and C4 plants to climate change may alter crop–weed interactions and competition outcomes, most likely at the expense of the crop. Climate change will likely cause shifts in weed community compositions, their population dynamics, life cycle, phenology, and infestation pressure. Some weed species may go extinct, while some others may become more aggressive invaders. Weeds are, generally, colonizers and have some unique biological traits and ecological amplitudes that enable them to successfully dominate crops in a habitat with changed environmental conditions. Moreover, climate shifts, especially erratic rainfall and drought, may affect herbicide selectivity and efficacy or the success of bio-control agents resulting in an establishment of a mixed and complex population of C3 and C4 weed species adding to the complexity of weed management. Although elevated CO2 levels will stimulate the productivity of major C3 crops, most troublesome agricultural weeds will likely be more responsive to a rise in CO2 than crops, and thus may dominate the agro-ecosystem. It is predicted that, as temperature rises, the majority of the C4 weeds will flourish and will pose serious crop yield losses. Understanding and assessment of the impact of simultaneous changes in multiple climate factors and their complex interactions on crops and weeds are therefore necessary to formulate an adaptive weed management approach and build resilience. Moreover, strategic policies and strong actions need to be taken to reduce the root causes of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions to minimize the impact of climate change on weed biology and managementOpen access;	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Agronomy and Crop Science	Crossref;Crossref	Islam, A.

	2296-665X	Padbhushan, Rajeev	Meta-analysis approach to measure the effect of integrated nutrient management on crop performance, microbial activity, and carbon stocks in Indian soils	Frontiers Media SA	Frontiers in Environmental Science	2021	Volume 9	Cereal crop production gains under conventional agricultural systems in India have been declining in recent years because of inadequate management practices, creating a considerable concern. These activities were shown to deplete soil organic matter stocks, resulting in a decrease in microbial activity and soil organic carbon (SOC) content. Moreover, even with minimal use of organic sources in cultivated land, soil carbon status deteriorated, particularly in subtropical climates. Integrated nutrient management (INM), a modified farming method, has the potential to effectively utilize organic and inorganic resources, to improve the quality of soils and crops, and making farming more economically viable and sustainable. The aim of this study was to use meta-analysis to quantify the effects of INM on crop production, soil carbon, and microbial activity in Indian soils. During the years 1989–2018, data from various research studies in India, mainly on nutrient management in rice and wheat crops, were collected. Meta-Win 2.1 software was used to analyze the results, and significance was determined at p &amp;lt; 0.05. The results showed that the yield of rice and wheat was 1.4 and 4.9% more in INM than that in 100% NPK (N: nitrogen, P: phosphorous, and K: potassium), and that respective yields were comparatively higher in loamy soils (2.8%) and clayey soils (1.0%). The INM treatment increased SOC and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), resulting in improved overall soil quality. The SOC stock was increased by 23.8% in rice, 15.1% in wheat, 25.3% in loamy soils, and 14.4% in clayey soils in INM over 100% NPK. Microbial quotient (MQ) data showed significant trends between different management systems in both soil types, for example, INM &amp;gt; 100% NPK &amp;gt; No NPK. Due to more soil cracking and reduced aggregate stability in the rice field (greater short-term soil structural changes), the SOC stock loss in rice was higher than that in wheat. The CO2 equivalent emissions were 7.9 Mg ha−1 higher in no NPK (control) than in 100% NPK, and 16.4 Mg ha−1 higher in control than in INM. In other words, INM increased soil carbon sequestration by 2.3 Mg ha−1 as compared to using 100% NPK. Overall, the findings of this study show that INM could be a viable farming system mode in India for improving crop production, increasing soil carbon sequestration, and improving microbial activity while remaining economically and environmentally sustainableOpen access	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	General Environmental Science	Crossref;Crossref	 Gupta, Vadakattu V.S.R.0;Sharma, Sheetal; Kumar, Upendra; Rana, D.S.; Kohli, Anshuman; Kaviraj, Megha; Parmar, Brajendra; Kumar, Rajkishore; Annapurna, K.; Sinha, Abhas Kumar	https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.724702	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DoN_U0IwrHS32tbEPH0oR2NRHh446q4C/view	View the full text	lcc	JA
	0030-7270	Donovan, Jason	Seed value chain development in the Global South: Key issues and new directions for public breeding programs	SAGE Publications	Outlook on Agriculture	2021	p. 003072702110595	Where CGIAR breeding programs rely on the private sector for the multiplication and distribution of improved cultivars, persistent challenges have dampened their impact on varietal adoption and turnover rates. Part of the problem is that research and practice in CGIAR and among its national breeding program partners tend to treat the private sector as a vehicle for seed delivery, rather than as commercial businesses facing a range of unique constraints and threats. This paper adopts a value chain framework to examine these relationships and pathways for improved varietal adoption/turnover outcomes in three cases: hybrid maize, farmed fish, and rice. In the first two cases, weak incentives and high risks left seed companies reluctant to invest in the marketing and quality assurance efforts needed to realize near-term impacts at scale from breeding investments. In the third case, seed companies played an insignificant role: grain traders supplied certified seed to smallholders, potentially prioritizing consumers’ quality preferences over climate-resilience and stress-tolerance traits for farmers. The findings raise important questions about the role of CGIAR and national breeding programs; specifically, how these programs can effectively support the private sector to deliver impact at greater scale, how consumer preferences are captured in trait prioritization within breeding programs, and what types of incentive mechanisms can be changed within breeding programs to advance a genuine shift towards ‘demand-oriented’ plant breeding.

Elevated expression of nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat proteins led to closer vein spacing and higher vein density in rice leaves.To feed the growing global population and mitigate the negative effects of climate change, there is a need to improve the photosynthetic capacity and efficiency of major crops such as rice to enhance grain yield potential. Alterations in internal leaf morphology and cellular architecture are needed to underpin some of these improvements. One of the targets is to generate a “Kranz-like” anatomy in leaves that includes decreased interveinal spacing close to that in C4 plant species. As C4 photosynthesis has evolved from C3 photosynthesis independently in multiple lineages, the genes required to facilitate C4 may already be present in the rice genome. The Taiwan Rice Insertional Mutants (TRIM) population offers the advantage of gain-of-function phenotype trapping, which accelerates the identification of rice gene function. In the present study, we screened the TRIM population to determine the extent to which genetic plasticity can alter vein density (VD) in rice. Close vein spacing mutant 1 (CVS1), identified from a VD screening of approximately 17,000 TRIM lines, conferred heritable high leaf VD. Increased vein number in CVS1 was confirmed to be associated with activated expression of two nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins. Overexpression of the two NB-LRR genes individually in rice recapitulates the high VD phenotype, due mainly to reduced interveinal mesophyll cell (M cell) number, length, bulliform cell size and thus interveinal distance. Our studies demonstrate that the trait of high VD in rice can be achieved by elevated expression of NB-LRR proteins limited to no yield penaltyOpen access;	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Plant Science; Agronomy and Crop Science; General Medicine	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	 Hsing, Yue-Ie; Quick, William Paul;Chatterjee, Jolly; Biswal, Akshaya K.; Liu, I.-Lun; Chang, Yu-Pei; Chen, Pei-Jing; Wanchana, Samart; Elmido-Mabilangan, Abigail; Nepomuceno, Robert A.; Bandyopadhyay, Anindya	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00299-021-02810-5	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z3i7ZUycbFBiH4u9qQp9MKILViLp03jf/view	View the full text	lcc	JA
	0929-1873	Niones, Jennifer T.	Dynamics of bacterial blight disease in resistant and susceptible rice varieties	Springer Science and Business Media LLC	European Journal of Plant Pathology	2022	(e-first copy); 17 p.	AbstractBacterial blight (X. oryzae pv. oryzae) is a serious disease in rice across the world. To better control the disease, it is important to understand its epidemiology and how key aspects of this (e.g. infection efficiency, and spatial spread) change according to environment (e.g. local site conditions and season), management, and in particular, variety resistance. To explore this, we analysed data on the disease progress on resistant and susceptible varieties of rice grown at four sites in the Philippines across five seasons using a combination of mechanistic modelling and statistical analysis. Disease incidence was generally lower in the resistant variety. However, we found no evidence that the primary infection efficiency was lower in resistant varieties, suggesting that differences were largely due to reduced secondary spread. Despite secondary spread being attributed to splash dispersal which is exacerbated by wind and rain, the wetter sites of Pila and Victoria in south Luzon tended to have lower infection rates than the drier sites in central Luzon. Likewise, we found spread in the dry season can be substantial and should therefore not be ignored. In fact, we found site to be a greater determinant of the number of infection attempts suggesting that other environmental and management factors had greater effect on the disease than climate. Primary infection was characterised by spatially-random observations of disease incidence. As the season progressed, we observed an emerging short-range (1.6 m–4 m) spatial structure suggesting secondary spread was predominantly short-range, particularly where the resistant variety was grownOpen access	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Agronomy and Crop Science;Horticulture;Plant Science	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	Donayre, Dindo King M.;Milne, Alice E.;Oliva, Ricardo;Oreiro, Eula Gems M.;Sharp, Ryan T.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10658-021-02452-z	https://drive.google.com/file/d/12RUWeW3wbGQH_8te9_AGLjg-34JFOx-I/view	View the full text	lcc	JA
	1939-8425	Juma, Roselyne U.	Identification of an elite core panel as a key breeding resource to accelerate the rate of genetic improvement for irrigated rice	Springer Science and Business Media LLC	Rice	2021	Volume 14, no. 92; 22 p.	Open access;Rice genetic improvement is a key component of achieving and maintaining food security in Asia and Africa in the face of growing populations and climate change. In this effort, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) continues to play a critical role in creating and disseminating rice varieties with higher productivity. Due to increasing demand for rice, especially in Africa, there is a strong need to accelerate the rate of genetic improvement for grain yield. In an effort to identify and characterize the elite breeding pool of IRRI’s irrigated rice breeding program, we analyzed 102 historical yield trials conducted in the Philippines during the period 2012–2016 and representing 15,286 breeding lines (including released varieties). A mixed model approach based on the pedigree relationship matrix was used to estimate breeding values for grain yield, which ranged from 2.12 to 6.27 t·ha−1. The rate of genetic gain for grain yield was estimated at 8.75 kg·ha−1 year−1 (0.23%) for crosses made in the period from 1964 to 2014. Reducing the data to only IRRI released varieties, the rate doubled to 17.36 kg·ha−1 year−1 (0.46%). Regressed against breeding cycle the rate of gain for grain yield was 185 kg·ha−1 cycle−1 (4.95%). We selected 72 top performing lines based on breeding values for grain yield to create an elite core panel (ECP) representing the genetic diversity in the breeding program with the highest heritable yield values from which new products can be derived. The ECP closely aligns with the indica 1B sub-group of Oryza sativa that includes most modern varieties for irrigated systems. Agronomic performance of the ECP under multiple environments in Asia and Africa confirmed its high yield potential. We found that the rate of genetic gain for grain yield found in this study was limited primarily by long cycle times and the direct introduction of non-improved material into the elite pool. Consequently, the current breeding scheme for irrigated rice at IRRI is based on rapid recurrent selection among highly elite lines. In this context, the ECP constitutes an important resource for IRRI and NAREs breeders to carefully characterize and manage that elite diversity.

In the first section, special emphasis is given to the current situation of Myanmar’s rice production as affected by climate change alongside with possible adaptation strategies. Since only a small share (23.6 %) of the rice area is irrigated, low precipitation climate extremes directly translate into either drought problems due to limited access of water in case of drought or flood problems due to limited drainage. Moreover, more than half of the national rice production derives from the Ayaryewady delta, so that Myanmar’s food security is very susceptible to impacts triggered tropical cyclones such as “Nargis” in 2008.

Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) is a well-known low-cost water-saving and climate change adaptation and mitigation technique for irrigated rice. However, its adoption rate has been low despite the decade of dissemination in Asia, especially in the Philippines. Using cross-sectional farm-level survey data, this study empirically explored factors shaping AWD adoption in a gravity surface irrigation system. We used regression-based approaches to examine the factors influencing farmers’ adoption of AWD and its impact on yield. Results showed that the majority of the AWD adopters were farmers who practiced enforced rotational irrigation (RI) scheduling within their irrigators’ association (IA). With the current irrigation management system, the probability of AWD implementation increases when farmers do not interfere with the irrigation schedule (otherwise they opt to go with flooding). Interestingly, the awareness factor did not play a significant role in the farmers’ adoption due to the RI setup. However, the perception of water management as an effective weed control method was positively significant, suggesting that farmers are likely to adopt AWD if weeds are not a major issue in their field. Furthermore, the impact on grain yields did not differ with AWD. Thus, given the RI scheduling already in place within the IA, we recommend fine-tuning this setup following the recommended safe AWD at the IA scaleOpen access;	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Water Science and Technology; Aquatic Science; Geography, Planning and Development; Biochemistry	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	Yadav, Sudhir; Evangelista, Gio; Burac, Mary Ann; Rafael, Marvelin; Cabangon, Romeo; Tokida, Takeshi; Mizoguchi, Masaru; Regalado, Manuel Jose	https://doi.org/10.3390/w14010005	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FNGRFFGlNWCRKWX0ZNhPttUw46P_kMSH/view	View the full text	lcc	JA
		Hossain, Mohammad Mobarak	Farmers’ participatory evaluation of alternate wetting and drying irrigation method on the greenhouse gas emission, water productivity and paddy yield in Bangladesh	MDPI AG	Preprints	2022	15 pages	In dry season paddy farming, the alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation improves water productivity, paddy production, and has the potential to decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions when compared to continuous flooding (CF). However, there is a lack of research in Bangladesh on the effects of water management on CH4 and N2O emissions. During November 2017&amp;ndash;April 2018, participatory on-farm trials were conducted at Feni and Chattogram districts of Bangladesh. Total 105 farmers comprising 20-hectare of land (62 farmers at Feni and 43 farmers at Chattogram district, each location having 10 hectare of land). We compared irrigation water and cost reductions, paddy yield, and CH4 and N2O emissions from paddy fields irrigated using AWD and CF irrigation methods. The CH4 and N2O emissions were determined using the Cool Farm Beta-3 methodology, and the global warming potential (GWP) was estimated using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-2014 standard approach. The mean results of randomly selected 30 farmers from two locations (15 of each) showed that AWD remarkably decreased irrigation water consumption by about 24% and increased water productivity by 224%. We estimated 23% savings for irrigation costs in AWD. By this time, AWD improved paddy production by 3% over CF. The AWD irrigation resulted in a 47% reduction in cumulative CH4 emissions having a lower CH4 emission factor (0.74 kg ha-1 day-1) than CF (1.39 kg ha-1 day-1).

	2071-1050	Chadalavada, Keerthi	Simulating potential impacts of future climate change on post-rainy season sorghum yields in India	MDPI AG	Sustainability	2021	Volume 14 no. 1 p. 334	Given the wide use of the multi-climate model mean (MMM) for impact assessment studies, this work examines the fidelity of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) in simulating the features of Indian summer monsoons as well as the post-rainy seasons for assessing the possible impacts of climate change on post-rainy season sorghum crop yields across India. The MMM simulations captured the spatial patterns and annual cycles of rainfall and surface air temperatures. However, bias was observed in the precipitation amounts and daily rainfall intensity. The trends in the simulations of MMM for both precipitation and temperatures were less satisfactory than the observed climate means. The Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-sorghum model was used to estimate the potential impacts of future climate change on post-rainy season sorghum yield values. On average, post-rainy season sorghum yields are projected to vary between −4% and +40% as well as +10% and +59% in the near future (2040–2069) for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively, and between +20% and +70% (RCP 4.5) as well as +38% and +89% (RCP 8.5) in the far future (2070–2099). Even though surface air temperatures are increasing in future climate change projections, the findings suggest that an increase in the post-rainy season sorghum yields was due to an increase in the rainfall amounts up to 23% and an increase in the atmospheric CO2 levels by the end of the 21st century. The results suggest that the projected climate change during the post-rainy season over India is an opportunity for smallholders to capitalize on the increase in rainfall amounts and further increase sorghum yields with appropriate crop management strategiesOpen access	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law; Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment; Geography, Planning and Development	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	Gummadi, Sridhar; Kundeti, Koteswara Rao; Kadiyala, Dakshina Murthy; Deevi, Kumara Charyulu; Dakhore, Kailas Kamaji; Bollipo Diana, Ranjitha Kumari; Thiruppathi, Senthil Kumar	https://doi.org/10.3390/su14010334	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lBvZdZNqMiNAX51Db1FD3bK0za05stUh/view	View the full text	lcc	JA
		Moyers, Brook T.	Strong genotype by environment interactions in the rice Global MAGIC population across seedling stage drought	Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory	bioRxiv preprint	2022	34 pages	Crop adaptation is required to sustainably increase the rate of yield gains to meet projected future needs under the challenging conditions of climate change and competition for resources. Future adaptation will likely need to harness both highly polygenic traits and genotype-by-environment interactions (GxE), the study of which is aided by complex recombinant populations. We used the diverse Oryza sativa Global Multiparent Advanced Generation InterCross (MAGIC) population to study the genetic architecture and contributions of seedling emergence, establishment, and development to yield components under dry-direct seeding and seedling stage drought across three growing seasons. Dry-direct seeding is an establishment practice that has the potential to reduce methane emissions, water use, and labor demands for rice farmers, but increases the possibility of early-season drought conditions. We found substa/ntial evidence for large roles of environmental variation and GxE in controlling trait variation. Maintenance of shoot growth during seedling stage drought was positively correlated with crown root number and both directly and indirectly influenced agronomic traits. Other than the major green revolution locus sd1, most allelic effects were conditionally neutral (affecting trait values in some environments but not others) and most alleles had their strongest effect in an environmental extreme. This discovery is both a challenge and a potential opportunity: with variable genetic architecture, selection in any one environment may not result in stable trait gains across environments. However, conditionally neutral GxE is a potential route to sustainable yield stability through allele pyramidingOpen access	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)		Crossref	Henry, Amelia; Raghavan, Chitra; Zaw, Hein; Marrano, Annarita; Leung, Hei; McKay, John	https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.07.479433	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BiEQHABgmtVE3ZaeCQOEG5JYso1c0Tsn/view	View the full text	lcc	JA

Food system sustainability has been highlighted as one of the major strategies to ensure healthy diets. A plethora of approaches to stabilize food systems have been suggested, including agroecology, climate-smart agriculture, and other forms of sustainable agriculture. However, a disconnect between sustainable production and consumption exists, which may hinder further progress toward achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2. This discourse was needed to connect these intersectional perspectives. To meet this need, we bring together the disconnected socio-environmental pillars and show how together they contribute to the food system sustainability agenda. We discuss the complexity of food system sustainability to cater to different geographies, building on evidence from development projects worldwide. We account for factors such as the need to incorporate intersectionality factors, food-system-related policy issues, food waste, food injustice, and undernutrition. While these intersectional inequalities can be solved through various human interventions, policy implementation, and dietary choices, we found that connecting the different policymakers remains a significant challenge for a sustainable food system. We propose implementing specific food system sustainability strategies that will be useful for policymakers and other stakeholders to enable the inclusion of a socio-environmental perspective for food systems that connect agricultural production with consumptionOpen access	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Horticulture; Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law; Agronomy and Crop Science; Ecology; Food Science; Global and Planetary Change	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	Connor, Melanie	https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2022.816936	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x_C0r9_A09VohaZ4OLs0Ou6SxVhJUdxG/view	View the full text	lcc	JA

Its agriculture sector has demonstrated rapid intensification and modernization. Agricultural best management practices (BMPs), e.g., drum seeders and laser land levelling, were introduced to rice farmers in Bago Region in 2012 to increase sustainable production and counter negative environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to determine the socioeconomic and agronomic changes due to the adoption of BMPs between adopters and non-adopters. Using a digital survey questionnaire application to collect household data, 200 farmers in eight villages were interviewed in 2012 and 2017. Data were analysed using uni- and multivariate statistics. Mediation analysis was utilized to evaluate the effect of the farmer group on rice yields. Overall, all farmers in this study experienced substantial positive changes over the course of five years in line with the national development efforts. Differences among adopters and non-adopters were not significant, but notable distinctions existed between cropping patterns. Rice-pulse farmers had higher yields ( + 0.4 t/ha), yet rice-rice farmers had larger cultivation areas, received higher agricultural credits, and had superior income levels. Nevertheless, rice yields remained low (&lt;4 t/ha). Education was found to be an important predictor of yield. Hence, this factor is crucial for accelerating agricultural development in Myanmar. Improving extension services and knowledge transfer are necessary to expand the dissemination of sustainable BMPs and make farmers more resilient against the negative implications of climate change.

	2296-665X	Padbhushan, Rajeev	Impact of land-use changes on soil properties and carbon pools in India: A meta-analysis	Frontiers Media SA	Frontiers in Environmental Science	2022	Volume 9, no. 794866; pages 1-15.	Open access;Land-use changes (LUC), primarily due to deforestation and soil disturbance, are one of the major causes of soil quality degradation and greenhouse gas emissions. Effects of LUC on soil physicochemical properties and changes in soil quality and land use management strategies that can effectively restore soil carbon and microbial biomass levels have been reported from all over the world, but the impact analysis of such practices in the Indian context is limited. In this study, over 1,786 paired datasets (for meta-analysis) on land uses (LUs) were collected from Indian literature (1990–2019) to determine the magnitude of the influence of LUC on soil carbon, microbial biomass, and other physical and chemical properties at three soil depths. Meta-analysis results showed that grasslands (36.1%) lost the most soil organic carbon (SOC) compared to native forest lands, followed by plantation lands (35.5%), cultivated lands (31.1%), barren lands (27.3%), and horticulture lands (11.5%). Our findings also revealed that, when compared to forest land, the microbial quotient was lower in other LUs. Due to the depletion of SOC stock, carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq) emissions were significantly higher in all LUs than in forest land. Results also showed that due to the conversion of forest land to cultivated land, total carbon, labile carbon, non-labile carbon, microbial biomass carbon, and SOC stocks were lost by 21%, 25%, 32%, 26%, and 41.2%, respectively. Changes in soil carbon pools and properties were more pronounced in surface (0–15 cm) soils than in subsurface soils (15–30 cm and 30–45 cm). Restoration of the SOC stocks from different LUs ranged from a minimum of 2% (grasslands) to a maximum of 48% (plantation lands). Overall, this study showed that soil carbon pools decreased as LUC transitioned from native forestland to other LUs, and it is suggested that adopting crop-production systems that can reduce CO2 emissions from the intensive LUs such as the ones evaluated here could contribute to improvements in soil quality and mitigation of climate change impacts, particularly under Indian agro-climatic conditions.

	2071-1050	Nayak, Swati	Adoption trend of climate-resilient rice varieties in Bangladesh	MDPI AG	Sustainability	2022	Volume 14 no. 9 p. 5156	Open access;Rice is a major crop in Bangladesh that supports both food security and livelihoods. However, a need remains for improved productivity and adaptation to the risks associated with climate change. To accomplish this, the increased adoption of climate-resilient and high-yielding rice varieties can be beneficial. Therefore, we conducted a study in Bangladesh over three consecutive years: 2016, 2017, and 2018. The scope of the study included the major cropping season (wet), Aman. The yield advantages of climate-resilient rice varieties were evaluated and compared with those of the varieties popular with farmers. We included new stress-tolerant varieties, such as submergence-tolerant rice (BRRI dhan51 and BRRI dhan52) and drought-tolerant rice (BRRI dhan56 and BRRI dhan71), along with farmer-chosen controls, in the study. We conducted the evaluation through on-farm trials to compare the varieties in both submergence- and drought-affected environments. The seasonal trials provided measured results of yield advantages. The participating farmers were also studied over the three-year-period to capture their varietal adoption rates. We calculated both the location estimated yield advantages (LEYA) and the location observed yield advantages (LOYA). The results revealed that, under non-stress conditions, the grain yields of climate-resilient varieties were either statistically similar to or higher than those of the farmer-chosen controls. Our study also revealed a year-to-year progressive adoption rate for the introduced varieties. The study suggests that the wide-scale introduction and popularization of climate-resilient varieties can ensure higher productivity and climate risk adaptation. The close similarity between LOYA and LEYA indicated that the observational and experiential conclusions of the host farmers were similar to the scientific performance of the varieties. We also found that comparison performed through on-farm trials was a critical method for enhancing experiential learning and obtaining an accurate estimation of yield advantages.

Sustainable management of transboundary pests requires holistic and inclusive solutions	Springer Science and Business Media LLC	Food Security	2022	(e-first copy); 9p.	Globalization and changing climates are aggravating the occurrence and impacts of transboundary pests, and driving the emergence of new threats. Most of the low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America are not fully prepared in terms of surveillance, diagnostics, and deployment of plant health solutions due to several factors: adequate investment is lacking; knowledge is inadequate; and connections from the local to global, and global to local are insufficient. Effectively countering the current and emerging threats to plant health requires a holistic approach that includes: 1) globally coordinated diagnostic and surveillance systems; 2) epidemiological modelling, risk assessment, forecasting and preparedness for proactive management and containment; and 3) implementation of context-sensitive, eco-friendly, gender-responsive and socially inclusive integrated disease and pest management approaches to reduce the impacts of devastating transboundary pests and diseases. Despite several success stories where major pests and diseases have been brought to control through integrated approaches, further multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary efforts are necessary. Plant health management requires stronger interface between the biophysical and social sciences, and empowerment of local communities. These reflections derive from the proceedings of a webinar on “Transboundary Disease and Pest Management,” organized by CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) on March 3, 2021, in recognition of the United Nations designated International Year of Plant HealthOpen access	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Agronomy and Crop Science; Development; Food Science	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	Carvajal-Yepes, Monica; Kumar, P.

	1939-8425	Shi, Wanju	Heat stress during gametogenesis irreversibly damages female reproductive organ in rice	Springer Science and Business Media LLC	Rice	2022	Volume 15, no. 1	Heat stress during gametogenesis leads to spikelet sterility. To ascertain the role of female reproductive organ (pistil), two rice genotypes N22 and IR64 with contrasting heat stress responses were exposed to control (30 °C) and heat stress (38 °C and 40 °C) during megasporogenesis. Anatomical observations of ovule revealed greater disappearance of megaspore mother cell and nuclei at early stages, and during later stages mature embryo sac without female germ unit, improper positioning of nuclei, and shrunken embryo sac was observed in the sensitive IR64. Under heat stress, a decrease in sugar and starch, increase in H2O2 and malondialdehyde with lower antioxidant enzyme activities were recorded in pistils of both N22 and IR64. Lower accumulation of TCA cycle metabolites and amino acids were noticed in IR64 pistils under heat stress at gametogenesis, whereas N22 exhibited favorable metabolite profiles. At heading, however, N22 pistils had higher carbohydrate accumulation and better ROS homeostasis, suggesting higher recovery after heat stress exposure. In summary, the results indicate that heat stress during megasporogenesis leads to irreversible anatomical and physiological changes in pistil and alters metabolic signatures leading to increased spikelet sterility in rice. Mechanisms identified for enhanced heat tolerance in pistil can help in developing rice varieties that are better adapted to future hotter climateOpen access	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Plant Science; Soil Science; Agronomy and Crop Science	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	Yang, Juan; Kumar, Ritesh; Zhang, Xinzheng; Impa, Somayanda M.; Xiao, Gui; Jagadish, S.

Time management governs climate resilience and productivity in the coupled rice–wheat cropping systems of eastern India	Springer Science and Business Media LLC	Nature Food	2022	Volume 3 no. 7 p. 542-551	India will need to produce 30% more wheat by 2050, and these gains must principally come from intensification in eastern India where low productivity is common. Through a dense network of on-farm surveys for the rice–wheat system in this region, we show that contemporary wheat sowing dates have a central influence on achieved and attainable yields, superseding all other crop management, soil and varietal factors. We estimate that untapped wheat production potential will increase by 69% with achievable adjustments to wheat sowing dates without incurring undesirable trade-offs with rice productivity, irrigation requirements or profitability. Our findings also indicate that transformative gains in wheat yields are only possible in eastern India if rice and wheat are managed as a coupled system.

	2045-2322	Kumar, Rakesh	Outburst of pest populations in rice-based cropping systems under conservation agricultural practices in the middle Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia	Springer Science and Business Media LLC	Scientific Reports	2022	Volume 12, no. 1	Conservation agriculture (CA), which encompasses minimum soil disturbance, residue retention either through crop residue, or cover crops and crop diversification-based crop management practices can modify the status of pest dynamics and activities under the changing climatic scenarios. CA has been advocated extensively to optimize the use of available resources, maintain the environmental quality, enhance crop productivity, and reduce the climate change impacts. Information related to the impacts of long-term CA-production systems under rice-based cropping systems on pest status is lacking, particularly in middle Indo-Gangetic Plains (MIGP). Under CA, puddling is completely avoided, and rice is directly sown or transplanted to maintain better soil health. Different sets of experimentations including farmers practice, partial CA and full CA (CA) as treatments in rice-based cropping systems, were established from 2009, 2015 and 2016 to understand the long-term impacts of CA on pest dynamics. In this study, direct and indirect effects of tillage (zero, reduced and conventional tillage), residue retention and cropping sequences on abundance and damage by pests were investigated. After 4–5 years of experimentation, populations of oriental armyworm [Mythinma (Leucania) (Pseudaletia) separata (Wlk.)] in wheat, mealybug [Brevennia rehi (Lindinger)] and bandicoot rat [Bandicota bengalensis (Gray)] in rice were found to increase abnormally in CA-based production systems. Conventionally tilled plots had a significant negative effect while residue load in zero-tilled plots had a significant positive effect on larval population build-up of M. separata. Zero tillage had a higher infestation of mealybug (52–91% infested hills) that used grassy weeds (Echinochloa colona, Echinochloa crusgalli, Cynodon dactylon, Leptochloa chinensis and Panicum repense) as alternate hosts. Cropping sequences and no disturbance of soil and grassy weeds had higher live burrow counts (4.2 and 13.7 burrows as compared to 1.47 and 7.53 burrows per 62.5 m2 during 2019–2020 and 2020–2021, respectively) and damaged tillers (3.4%) in CA-based practices. Based on the present study, pest management strategies in CA need to be revisited with respect to tillage, residue retention on soil surface, grassy weeds in field and cropping sequences to deliver the full benefits of CA in MIGP to achieve the sustainable development goals under the climate change scenariosOpen access	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Multidisciplinary	Crossref;Crossref	 Kumar, Virender; Malik, Ram Kanwar; McDonald, Andrew;Choudhary, Jaipal Singh; Mishra, Janki Sharan; Mondal, Surajit; Poonia, Shishpal; Monobrullah, Mohammad; Hans, Hansraj; Verma, Mausam; Kumar, Ujjwal; Bhatt, Bhagwati Prasad	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-07760-w	https://drive.google.com/file/d/18FTwfgHHbAK9TVfyuo7d2sRzjHBpBdnh/view	View the full text	lcc	JA

Data analytics are essential for achieving this goal, especially the so-called science of enviromics (large-scale environmental characterization of crop growing conditions) that could be used to pinpoint the relevant environment impacts driving the adaptation of a certain specie in a breeding framework. Here we quantified the effects of diverse climate factors on the current adaptation of elite common bean germplasm in Brazil. To capture the non-linearity of those impacts across a wide range of environments, we developed an ""enviromic prediction"" approach by combining Generalized Additive Models (GAM), environmental covariates (EC), and grain yield (GY) from 18 years of historical breeding trials. Then, we predicted the optimum limits for ECs at each production scenario (four regions, three seasons, and two grain types) and its respective predictions of GY adaptation. Our results indicate that the nonlinear influence of air temperature, solar radiation, and rainfall led to a huge interaction of the impacts among the development stages, seasons, and regions. This revealed that seasonality differently affected the vegetative and reproductive stages, which its impact drastically vary according to the region and season, which makes unfeasible the development of a breeding strategy for selecting for broad adaptation. Conversely, with our approach it was possible to pinpoint the effects of the region- or season-specific impacts, which helped identify the ""climate limits"" and critical development phases for each possible production scenario. This could allow breeders to design crop ideotypes while directing efforts to develop climate-smart varieties. Furthermore, enviromics prediction is a cost-effective way to use EC as a data analytics tool to support the visualization of regional breeding gaps for specific growing conditions."

	2077-0472	Navea, Ian Paul	Assessing the effect of a major quantitative locus for phosphorus uptake (Pup1) in rice (O. sativa L.) grown under a temperate region	MDPI AG	Agriculture	2022	Volume 12 no. 12 p. 2056	Open access;Water and phosphorus (P) fertilizer are two of the most critical inputs in rice cultivation. Irrigation and chemical fertilizers are becoming limiting factors under climate change and urbanization, which is leading to significant losses in yield. The Pup1 quantitative trait locus (QTL) confers tolerance to P starvation through enhanced early-stage root vigor and P uptake in indica rice grown in the tropics. Whether the QTL works in temperate rice genetic backgrounds grown in temperate regions remains to be elucidated. To address this question, we introgressed the Pup1 QTL into three temperate rice varieties—MS11, TR22183, and Dasanbyeo—using marker-assisted backcrossing and high-density genotyping. The selected lines all harbored the full Pup1 QTL with recurrent parent genome recovery rates ranging from 66.5% to 99.8%. Under the rainfed and P non-supplied conditions, Pup1 introgression lines did not show clear advantages over the recurrent parents in terms of vegetative growth and grain yield per plant, but exhibited enhanced yield responses to P application, except in Dasanbyeo, which a temperate rice that is genetically similar to indica. Our results suggest that Pup1 confers enhanced P uptake in temperate rice and that the efficacy of Pup1 might depend on the subspecific genomic background of the rice, whether it is japonica or indica.

To this end, the climate-smart village (CSV) approach was developed to address specific challenges of smallholder farmers. Within Southeast Asia, the CSV approach has so far been applied in Myanmar, Lao PDR, Cambodia, as well as in Vietnam and the Philippines where national programs have taken it up and established multiple CSVs. Despite distinct climatic conditions, all these CSVs have rice-based landscapes as a common denominator. This article focuses on the improvement of rice seed systems as the core of introducing climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in these villages. The experience of a CSV in Lao PDR clearly shows community-based seed (CBS) systems as a viable CSV component. Moreover, the efficiency of CBS systems is enhanced when applied in combination with the following supporting climate-smart interventions: (1) training in improved crop and pest management through farmers’ field schools, (2) awareness raising through photo exhibits and seed fairs, (3) participatory variety selection, and (4) climate risk mapping as a means for targeted distribution of improved rice varieties. The study also explored direct market access for CSV products by advertising both the generic aspects of climate-smart adaptation strategies and the location-specific stories of smallholder farmers. To this end, the emerging online retail economy could offer viable avenues for highlighting specific aspects of food production in CSVs to different groups of consumers (e.g., the “buy local” preference in the domestic market and climate change concerns in the international market)	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Adaptation;Cimate-smart agricutlure;Crop management;Seed systems;Lao PDR	Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref;Crossref	 Gonsalves, Julian; Sprang, Peter; Yen, Bui Tan; Villanueva, Jerome; Nelakhom, Phalida; Okumu, Bernard	https://doi.org/10.37801/ajad2022.19.1.p2	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U6tr1NHpvyN2cPw0ahmh5--IinxTr1NM/view	View the full text	lcc	JA
	0040-5752	Rahman, Niaz Md. Farhat	50 years of rice breeding in Bangladesh: genetic yield trends	Springer Science and Business Media LLC	Theoretical and Applied Genetics	2023	Volume 136 no. 1 p. 1-13	Open access;To assess the efficiency of genetic improvement programs, it is essential to assess the genetic trend in long-term data. The present study estimates the genetic trends for grain yield of rice varieties released between 1970 and 2020 by the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute. The yield of the varieties was assessed from 2001–2002 to 2020–2021 in multi-locations trials. In such a series of trials, yield may increase over time due to (i) genetic improvement (genetic trend) and (ii) improved management or favorable climate change (agronomic/non-genetic trend). In both the winter and monsoon seasons, we observed positive genetic and non-genetic trends. The annual genetic trend for grain yield in both winter and monsoon rice varieties was 0.01 t ha−1, while the non-genetic trend for both seasons was 0.02 t ha−1, corresponding to yearly genetic gains of 0.28% and 0.18% in winter and monsoon seasons, respectively. The overall percentage yield change from 1970 until 2020 for winter rice was 40.96%, of which 13.91% was genetic trend and 27.05% was non-genetic. For the monsoon season, the overall percentage change from 1973 until 2020 was 38.39%, of which genetic and non-genetic increases were 8.36% and 30.03%, respectively. Overall, the contribution of non-genetic trend is larger than genetic trend both for winter and monsoon seasons. These results suggest that limited progress has been made in improving yield in Bangladeshi rice breeding programs over the last 50 years. Breeding programs need to be modernized to deliver sufficient genetic gains in the future to sustain Bangladeshi food security.

It is playing a substantial role in food and nutritional security. Rice production is not sufficient to meet domestic consumption, so its import has been increasing. This study aims to explore whether Nepal can be self-sufficient in rice production in the current context of increasing rice demand and changing climate. We assessed the degree to which Nepal can be self-sufficient in rice production by the years 2030, 2040, and 2050, evaluating 12 different scenarios of demand driven by production, population growth, income, and climate change effect. We used compound growth rate estimation for analyzing the growth of rice production and population growth over time. Auto-regressive regression model was used to analyze the relationship of rice import and demand with domestic production, income, and population. A significant (p=0.000) positive impact of income on the import of rice was estimated, whereas significantly (p=0.000) higher impact of production on demand was estimated compared to income. Based on current rice productivity growth of 1.47% and population growth of 1.3% per year over three decades, the country will not achieve self-sufficiency until 2050.The situation would be further worsened in climate change scenarios. However, integrating the population growth rate of the last decade (0.57% per annum) with two productivity growth rate scenarios (current and (ii) 5% annual increment), the country can be self-sufficient by 2040. Based on different scenarios, the estimated demand can be met by increasing current productivity by at least 27–43% by 2030 and 42–85% by 2050. The study identified major gaps and opportunities in the rice production systems of Nepal and provided evidence-based solutions to meet the future demands in the context of increasing population and income, declining land availability, and high vulnerability to climate change.

	1876-4517	Islam, Md. Rafiqul	The role of minor cereals in food and nutrition security in Bangladesh: constraints to sustainable production	Springer Science and Business Media LLC	Food Security	2023		Minor cereals are becoming increasingly important for global food security because of their high nutritional value and their tolerance to environmental stresses. In adverse agrosystems, these crops are often more promising than the major cereals. Considering the climate change effect on a number of major cereals, minor cereals are becoming popular in Asian countries. In Bangladesh, minor cereals have been cultivated on a small-scale for a long time, but limited information is available on their growth, yield, and the possibility of expanding the cultivated area. This study evaluated the status and potential of minor cereals using secondary data, GIS mapping, and structured survey questionnaires. Currently, minor cereals are grown on around 4813 ha of land. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) alone accounts for 63.0% of the area cultivated, followed by proso millet (Panicum miliaceum) 28.2%, barley (Hordeum vulgare) 7.5%, pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) 0.6%, and oats (Avena sativa) 0.6%. The current yield of minor cereals is low, around 2.0 t ha−1. The crops are mostly grown on marginal lands formed by river siltation, locally called char lands. Minor cereal farmers take advantage of the low production costs, including inputs, relatively simple cultural practices, and minimal risks of crop loss from natural hazards to grow minor cereals. Mainly low yield levels and lack of high-yielding varieties and production technologies limit large-scale cultivation of minor cereals. Strengthening research to develop high-yielding, climate-resilient varieties of minor cereals and improved agronomic management methods and raising farmers’ awareness about their nutritional value and economic benefits will be needed to ensure their sustainable production and extension.

	2214-6628	Malabanan-Bauan, Katrina B.	Development and validation of a genome-wide InDel marker set discriminating the alleles between the BB-genome Oryza species and rice (O. sativa)	Elsevier BV	Current Plant Biology	2023	Volume 34; 100285 [6p.]	Open access;Wild relatives of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) belonging to the genus Oryza are regarded as ‘genetic reservoirs’ for rice improvement. Their genes are transferable to cultivated rice through crossing and they have been contributing significantly to rice variety improvement by introgression of their diverse valuable traits, especially biotic stress resistance. Moreover, active use of wild rice resources might be one of the ideal solutions to seek novel or superior alleles/genes to cope with climate change and stable high-yield rice production. DNA markers are essential tools for genetic analysis and breeding. However, to date, there are no suitable DNA marker sets for BB-genome species (O. punctata). In this study, we developed a genome genome-wide InDel marker set evenly distributed (∼2 Mb intervals) across the 12 chromosomes for BB-genome species. The markers were validated by PCR-agarose gel analysis with BB-genome containing species: four accessions each of O. punctata (BB) and O. minuta (BBCC). Out of the 191 InDel markers designed, 184 (96.3%) and 138 (72.2%) were able to differentiate the alleles between O. sativa and O. punctata and between O. sativa and O. minuta respectively. The same marker sets were also tested in other genome types species (CC, CCDD, EE, FF, GG, HHJJ, and KKLL) and one accession of Leersia perrieri (a sister genus to Oryza). The number of polymorphic markers (O. sativa vs other genome types) was drastically reduced in other genome types. In contrast, the number of markers showing no PCR amplification increased, especially in FF, GG, HHJJ, and KKLL species. This suggests that the development of genome type-specific marker sets would be more efficient rather than testing random InDel markers. The newly developed InDel markers maybe be useful for the identification of valuable genetic factors from the BB or BBCC-genome species and also for transferring the identified genes/QTLs into elite variety backgrounds.

		Kamruzzaman, Mohammad	Assessment of climate change impact on thermal bioclimatic indicators in a tropical region with the climate projections from CMIP6 modele dynamics	Research Square Platform LLC	Research Square	2023	[pre-print] 34 pages.	The global mean surface temperature is expected to continue to rise as a result of climate change. However, the effects of this transformation are not uniformly distributed across the globe, making regional analysis essential. As a monsoon region with tropical and low-lying terrain, Bangladesh is especially susceptible to the effects of climate change. Despite this, no effort has been made to evaluate the potential changes in thermal bioclimatic indicators (TBIs) in practical applications, which is crucial. Using a multi-model ensemble (MME) of 18 CMIP6 GCMs, this study projected the variations in 11 TBIs across Bangladesh for the near (2015–2044), mid (2045–2074), and far (2075–2100) futures under three SSPs: low (SSP126), medium (SSP245), and high (SSP585). The study revealed that in the future, the average annual temperature in Bangladesh will increase by 0.62 to 1.85°C for SSP126, by 0.51 to 2.81°C for SSP245, and by 0.54 to 4.88°C for SSP585, indicating a rise in temperature that is consistent with the global average. In addition, the study predicted that the diurnal temperature range (DTR) could decrease by -0.17 to -2.50°C, and that isothermality could decrease by as much as -0.30% at many stations. The projected temperature rise would be highly variable, ranging from 0.14 to 0.39°C in the northeast and southeast to 0.17 to 2.66°C in the northwestern, central, and southwestern regions. In addition, the study revealed a considerable increase in average temperature between the coldest and warmest quarters. The average temperature would increase significantly more in the drier quarter than in the wettest quarter. These findings are crucial for establishing mitigation goals and adapting to climate change in Bangladesh, underscoring the urgency of taking the necessary steps to combat the negative effects of global warming.;Open access	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Climate change; Adaptation; Global warming; Mitigation; Bangladesh	Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc	Islam, H.

It contributes ∼20% of calories to the human diet (Stein et al., 2018). With the increase in global population and rapid changes in climate, rice breeders need to develop new and sustainable cultivars with higher yields, healthier grains, and reduced environmental footprints (Wing et al., 2018). Since the first gold-standard reference genome of rice variety Nipponbare was published (International Rice Genome Sequencing Project, 2005), an increasing number of rice accessions have been sequenced, assembled, and annotated with global efforts. Nowadays, a single reference genome is obviously insufficient to perform the genetic difference analysis for rice accessions. Therefore, the pan-genome has been proposed as a solution, which allows the discovery of more presence-absence variants compared with single-reference genome-based studies (Zhao et al., 2018). Over the past years, several databases, such as RAP-db (https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp), RGAP (http://rice.uga.edu), and Gramene (https://www.gramene.org), have long-term served rice genomic research by providing information based on one or a series of individual reference genomes.

Basmati rice is inherently sensitive to various environmental stresses. Abrupt changes in climatic patterns and freshwater scarcity are escalating the issues associated with premium-quality rice production. However, few screening studies have selected Basmati rice genotypes suitable for drought-prone areas. This study investigated 19 physio-morphological and growth responses of 15 Super Basmati (SB) introgressed recombinants (SBIRs) and their parents (SB and IR554190-04) under drought stress to elucidate drought-tolerance traits and identify promising lines. After two weeks of drought stress, several physiological and growth performance traits significantly varied between the SBIRs (p ≤ 0.05) and were less affected in the SBIRs and the donor (SB and IR554190-04) than SB. The total drought response indices (TDRI) identified three superior lines (SBIR-153-146-13, SBIR-127-105-12, SBIR-62-79-8) and three on par with the donor and drought-tolerant check (SBIR-17-21-3, SBIR-31-43-4, SBIR-103-98-10) in adapting to drought conditions. Another three lines (SBIR-48-56-5, SBIR-52-60-6, SBIR-58-60-7) had moderate drought tolerance, while six lines (SBIR-7-18-1, SBIR-16-21-2, SBIR-76-83-9, SBIR-118-104-11, SBIR-170-258-14, SBIR-175-369-15) had low drought tolerance. Furthermore, the tolerant lines exhibited mechanisms associated with improved shoot biomass maintenance under drought by adjusting resource allocation to roots and shoots. Hence, the identified tolerant lines could be used as potential donors in drought-tolerant rice breeding programs, administered for subsequent varietal development, and studied to identify the genes underlying drought tolerance.

	2071-1050	Thanh, Phong Nguyen	Adapting to Climate-Change-Induced Drought Stress to Improve Water Management in Southeast Vietnam	MDPI AG	Sustainability	2023	Volume 15 no. 11 p. 9021	In Southeast Vietnam, droughts have become more frequent, causing significant damage and impacting the region’s socio-economic development. Water shortages frequently affect the industrial and agricultural sectors in the area. This study aims to calculate the water balance and the resilience of existing water resource allocations in the La Nga-Luy River basin based on two scenarios: (1) business-as-usual and (2) following a sustainable development approach. The MIKE NAM and MIKE HYDRO BASIN models were used for rainfall–runoff (R-R) and water balance modeling, respectively, and the Keetch–Byram Drought Index (KBDI) was used to estimate the magnitude of the droughts. The results identified areas within the Nga-Luy River basin where abnormally dry and moderate drought conditions are common, as well as subbasins, i.e., in the southeast and northeast, where severe and extreme droughts often prevail. It was also shown that the water demand for the irrigation of the winter–spring and summer–autumn crop life cycles could be fully met under abnormally dry conditions. This possibility decreases to 85–100% during moderate droughts, however. In contrast, 65% and 45–50% of the water demand for irrigation is met for the winter–spring and summer–autumn crop life cycles, respectively, during severe and extreme droughts. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the water demand for irrigation could still be met 100% and 75–80% of the time during moderate, and extreme or severe droughts, respectively, through increased water use efficiency. This study could help managers to rationally regulate water in order to meet the agricultural sector’s needs in the region and reduce the damage and costs caused by droughtsOpen access;	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Agricultural sector; Industrial sector; Water balance; Water demand; Irrigation; Managers; Damage; Costs 	Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc;Agrovoc	 Dinh, Vuong Nguyen;Le Van, Thinh; Minh, Tuan Tran; Ngoc, Tuyen Huynh; Lohpaisankrit, Worapong; Pham, Quoc Bao; Gagnon, Alexandre S.; Deb, Proloy; Pham, Nhat Truong; Anh, Duong Tran	https://doi.org/10.3390/su15119021	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iJb3givVC68f8AW_O26i4LrtYbBA6HMF/view	View the full text	lcc	JA

Where the wild things are: genetic associations of environmental adaptation in the Oryza rufipogon species complex	Oxford University Press (OUP)	Genes, Genomes, Genetics 	2023	 jkad128; 10 pages	Crop wild relatives host unique adaptation strategies that enable them to thrive across a wide range of habitats. As pressures from a changing climate mount, a more complete understanding of the genetic variation that underlies this adaptation could enable broader utilization of wild materials for crop improvement. Here, we carry out environmental association analyses (EAA) in the Oryza rufipogon species complex (ORSC), the wild progenitor of cultivated Asian rice, to identify genomic regions associated with environmental adaptation characterized by variation in bioclimatic and soil variables. We further examine regions for colocalizations with phenotypic associations within the same collection. EAA results indicate that significant regions tend to associate with single environmental variables, although 2 significant loci on chromosomes 3 and 5 are detected as common across multiple variable types (i.e. precipitation, temperature, and/or soil). Distributions of allele frequencies at significant loci across subpopulations of cultivated Oryza sativa indicate that, in some cases, adaptive variation may already be present among cultivars, although evaluation in cultivated populations is needed to empirically test this.

	2662-4044	Hellin, Jon	Transformative adaptation: from climate-smart to climate-resilient agriculture	Springer Science and Business Media LLC	CABI Agriculture and Bioscience	2023	Volume 4, no. 1	In response to the climate crisis, there has been much focus on climate-smart agriculture (CSA); namely, technologies and practices that enhance adaptation, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and contribute to food security; the so-called triple win. Success has tended to be measured in terms of the number of farmers adopting CSA with less focus given to the impacts especially on human development. CSA can inadvertently lead to ‘maladaptation’ whereby interventions reinforce existing vulnerabilities either by benefitting powerful elites or by transferring risks and exposure between groups. Such maladaptive outcomes often stem from overly technical adaptation programming that is driven by external objectives and discounts the social and political dynamics of vulnerability. Increasingly a more nuanced picture is emerging. This reveals how a failure to contextualize CSA in relation to the structural socio-economic dynamics associated with agricultural systems that render some categories of farmer especially vulnerable to climate change, undermines CSA’s contribution to reducing rural poverty and increasing equity. In response, there is a growing focus on transformative orientations that pursue a more deep-seated approach to social, institutional, technological and cultural change in order to address the structural contributors to vulnerability and differential exposure to climate risk. Addressing these questions requires a robust consideration of the social contexts and power relations through which agriculture is both researched and practiced. For agriculture to be transformative and contribute to broader development goals, a greater emphasis is needed on issues of farmer heterogeneity, the dangers of maladaptation and the importance of social equity. This entails recognizing that resilience encompasses both agro- and socio-ecological dimensions. Furthermore, practitioners need to be more cognizant of the dangers of (i) benefiting groups of already better off farmers at the expense of the most vulnerable and/or (ii) focusing on farmers for whom agriculture is not a pathway out of poverty. The success of these approaches rests on genuine transdisciplinary partnerships and systems approaches that ensure adaptation and mitigation goals along with more equitable incomes, food security and development.

Status quo and challenges of rice production in sub-Saharan Africa	Informa UK Limited	Plant Production Science	2023	Volume 26 no. 3 p. 320-333	Open access;Rice production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has increaed ten-fold since 1961, whereas its consumption has exceeded the production and the regional self-sufficiency rate is only 48% in 2020. Increase in rice production has come mainly from increased harvested area. Yield increase has been limited and the current average yield in SSA is around 2 t ha−1. This paper aims to provide the status quo of (i) current rice production and its challenges, (ii) selected achievements in rice agronomy research mainly by the Africa Rice Center and its partners, and (iii) perspectives for future research on rice agronomy in SSA. The major problems confronting rice production include low yield in rainfed environments, accounting for 70% of the total rice harvested area. Rainfed rice yields are strongly affected by climate extremes such as water stresses, soil-related constraints, and sub-optimum natural resource management and crop management practices by smallholder farmers including poor water management, and suboptimal use of fertilizers, herbicides, and machineries. For alleviating these constraints, a wide range of technologies have been developed and introduced over the last three decades. These include water conservation technologies in rainfed and irrigated lowland rice, site-specific nutrient management practices, decision support tools such as crop growth simulation models, and labor-saving technologies. We conclude that further research efforts are needed to develop locally adapted agronomic solutions for sustainable intensification, especially in rainfed rice to enhance the resilience to climate change and increase land and labor productivity and sustainability of rice cultivation in SSA.

Climate change threatens food security worldwide and has severely impacted the Indian agricultural sector. As a result of the unpredictable climate and low profits, economic uncertainty has forced men to seek employment in non-farming sectors. Under the deepening crisis, the farming landscape has transformed into a female-majority workforce. To identify pragmatic solutions to the deepening agrarian crisis, we employed a qualitative triangulation approach to our investigation of the feminisation of the farming sector, which was conducted in 2020. Our analyses of Indian media narratives, archive stories, responses to an online story completion task, and in-depth expert interviews show that, despite their developing role and increasing contribution, women remain marginalised and discriminated against in a culturally male-dominant sector. Supported by a long-term field ethnographic experience, we used Installation Theory to identify three domains in which policymakers can intervene to promote the interconnected issues of social sustainability, gender equality, and sustainable economic development in this sector.

	2662-138X	Qian, Haoyu	Greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation in rice agriculture	Springer Science and Business Media LLC	Nature Reviews Earth & Environment	2023		Rice paddies supply half the global population with staple food, but also account for ~48% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from croplands. In this Review, we outline the characteristics of GHG emissions (CH4 and N2O) from paddy soils, focusing on climate change effects and mitigation strategies. Global mean annual area-scaled and yield-scaled GHG emissions are ~7,870 kg CO2e ha−1 and 0.9 kg CO2e kg−1, respectively, with 94% from CH4. However, emissions vary markedly, primarily reflecting the impact of management practices. In particular, organic matter additions and continuous flooding of paddies both stimulate CH4 emissions, whereas fertilizer N application rate is the most important driver of N2O emissions. Although contemporary changes in emissions are uncertain, future elevated [CO2] and warming are projected to increase CH4 emissions by 4–40% and 15–23%, respectively. Yet, integrated agronomic management strategies — including cultivar, organic matter, water, tillage and nitrogen management — offer GHG mitigation potential. In particular, new rice variety selection, non-continuous flooding and straw removal strategies reduce GHG emissions by 24%, 44% and 46% on average, respectively. However, approaches need to be optimized on the basis of seasonal CH4 emission patterns, necessitating improved quantification and reduced uncertainty in regional and global GHG estimates, especially in low latitudes.

			Context-specific assessments of carbon footprints of the rice value chain: from product labeling to potential mitigation impacts		International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment 	2023		Purpose This study presents three contrasting applications using calculation tools for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon footprints (C-footprint) that were specifically developed for rice production. This includes a new digital information system for labeling, tracking, and optional auditing of product-specific C-footprints that complements calculation tools developed to quantify GHG emissions and C-footprints. Collectively, these tools are used in different contexts to show their versatility for a variation of purposes.  Methods The digital system requires product-specific information on the rice value chain encompassing cultivation, harvest, and post-harvest processes. The tool provides comprehensive GHG data for tracking C-footprints along the value chain and generates a QR code that can be printed as a product label for marketing purposes. The 2nd and 3rd applications are based on calculation tools with coherent equations as the digital system but with different output formats and scopes. While this C-footprint data in the 2nd application encompasses the entire rice value chain, our 3rd application illustrates the intricacies of quantifying the climate change impacts of technological mitigation options in rice cultivation depending on different GHG metrics and time horizons.  Results and discussion The digital information system comprises a two-pronged approach for private sector applications: (i) GHG tracking along the rice value chain and (ii) product labeling for communicating information on product-specific C-footprints to end users. The principal distinction of GHG emission versus C-footprints was elucidated through (i) a sequential assessment of both parameters along the individual stages of the value chain and (ii) a comparative assessment of different yield levels showing that the reduction in C-footprints does not necessarily equal overall mitigation of GHG emissions in case of higher resource inputs. The juxtaposition of global warming potential (GWP), global temperature potential (GTP), and GWP* highlighted the pivotal role of the short-lived GHG CH4 in assessing potential mitigation impacts.  Conclusions The digital system opens up a pathway to marketing low-carbon rice products that could incentivize investments in improved technologies. The impact assessment underlines the significance of selecting the most appropriate GHG metrics for mitigation planning–especially for GHG sources like rice that are dominated by CH4 emissions.

		Sandhu, N.	Evaluating the performance of rice genotypes for improving yield and adaptability under direct seeded aerobic cultivation conditions		Frontiers in Plant Science 	2019		With the changing climatic conditions and reducing labor-water availability, the potential contribution of aerobic rice varieties and cultivation system to develop a sustainable rice based agri-food system has never been more important than today. Keeping in mind the goal of identifying high-yielding aerobic rice varieties for wider adaptation, a set of aerobic rice breeding lines were developed and evaluated for grain yield, plant height and days to 50% flowering in 23 experiments conducted across different location in Philippines, India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Lao-PDR between 2014-2017 in both wet and dry seasons. The heritability for grain yield ranged from 0.52 to 0.90. The season-wise two-stage analysis indicated significant genotype x location interaction for yield under aerobic conditions in both wet and dry seasons. The genotype x season x location interaction for yield was non-significant in both seasons indicating that across seasons the genotypes at each location did not show variability in the grain yield performance. Mean grain yield of the studied genotypes across different locations/seasons ranged from 2085 to 6433 Kg ha-1. The best-fit model for yield stability with low AIC value (542.6) was AMMI(1) model. The identified stable genotypes; IR 92521-143-2-2-1, IR 97048-10-1-1-3, IR 91326-7-13-1-1, IR 91326-20-2-1-4 and IR 91328-43-6-2-1 may serve as novel breeding material for varietal development under aerobic system of rice cultivation. High yield and stable performance of promising breeding lines may be due to presence of the earlier identified QTLs including grain yield under drought, grain yield under aerobic conditions, nutrient uptake, anaerobic germination, adaptability under direct seeded conditions and tolerance to biotic stress resistance such as qDTY2.1, qDTY3.1, qDTY12.1, qNR5.1, AG9.1, qEVV9.1, qRHD1.1, qRHD5.1, qRHD8.1 qEMM1.1, qGY6.1, BPH3, BPH17, GM4, xa4, Xa21, Pita and Pita2. The frequency of xa4 gene was highest followed by qAG9.1, GM4, qDTY3.1, qDTY2.1, qGY6.1 and qDTY12.1.	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)		Rice thesaurus	Yadaw, R.

Reviewing Vietnam’s nationally determined contribution: a new perspective using the marginal cost of abatement		Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems	2019	volume 3, no. 14; pages 1-12.	The processes countries use to revise their Nationally Determined Commitments (NDCs) under the UNFCCC’s Paris Agreement will be key to ensure that their pledges give effective climate change policy. In many developing countries, the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector is central to their NDCs. We generated a marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve for Vietnam’s AFOLU sector and used it to review the country’s mitigation pledges for this sector. We conclude that Vietnam could increase the emission pledges in its NDC, especially in future land use. Other options for mitigation at negative cost include water techniques in rice, agroforestry and management of livestock diets and manure. The MAC curve alone is insufficient to prioritize policy options for climate change policy, however, because it underestimates adaptation co-benefits, for example, in protected mangrove systems	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)		Rice thesaurus	Grosjean, G.;Läderach, P.;Nghia, T.

		Hellin, J.	Climate-smart agriculture and non-agricultural livelihood transformation		Climate 	2019	volume 7, no. 48; 8 pages	Abstract Agricultural researchers have developed a number of agricultural technologies and practices, known collectively as climate-smart agriculture (CSA), as part of climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. Development practitioners invest in scaling these to have a wider impact. We use the example of the Western Highlands in Guatemala to illustrate how a focus on the number of farmers adopting CSA can foster a tendency to homogenize farmers, instead of recognizing differentiation within farming populations. Poverty is endemic in the Western Highlands, and inequitable land distribution means that farmers have, on average, access to 0.06 ha per person. For many farmers, agriculture per se does not represent a pathway out of poverty, and they are increasingly reliant on non-agricultural income sources. Ineffective targeting of CSA, hence, ignores small-scale farming households’ different capacities for livelihood transformation, which are linked to the opportunities and constraints afforded by different livelihood pathways, agricultural and non-agricultural. Climate-smart interventions will often require a broader and more radical agenda that includes supporting farm households’ ability to build non-agricultural-based livelihoods. Climate risk management options that include livelihood transformation of both agricultural and non-agricultural livelihoods will require concerted cross-disciplinary research and development that encompasses a broader set of disciplines than has tended to be the case to date within the context of CSA.

		Wassmann, R.	Adaptation, mitigation and food security: Multi-criteria ranking system for climate-smart agriculture technologies illustrated for rainfed rice in Laos		Global Food Security 	2019	volume 23; pages 33-40.	Abstract Climate-smart Agriculture (CSA) represents a commonly accepted term in referring to intended changes in agriculture production addressing climate change. Although specific definitions may vary, CSA is typically conceived as having three pillars, namely Adaptation, Food Security and Mitigation. These three pillars as such, however, do not suffice for assessing scaling potentials of different CSA technologies as several other drivers may accelerate or impede large-scale adoption. This paper introduces a systematic approach for a comparative assessment of technology-specific scaling potentials distinguishing among three clusters of criteria.  The ranking system requires scoring of CSA technologies by different stakeholder groups, namely farmers and extension workers/policy makers as well as research-based scoring. These scored values are then incorporated into a formula for calculating technology-specific ranking indices. This procedure also includes weighting factors to account for high and low significance of individual criteria for CSA scaling.  The entire scoring procedure is illustrated through the case of a Climate-smart Village in Laos which is dominated by rainfed rice with low resource inputs. Improvements of rice varieties and seed systems clearly emerged as the most promising CSA intervention. Ideally, seeds used by farmers should (i) be a drought-tolerant rice variety and (ii) have better quality in terms of seed vigor and purity. Finally, the article discusses the applicability and versatility of this ranking system for other land use systems.

		Meah, Nafees	Climate uncertainty and policy making—what do policy makers want to know?		Regional Environmental Change 	2019	(e-first copy); 11 pages.	Abstract In climate change science, the existence of a high degree of uncertainty seems to be the cause of anxiety for many scientists because it appears to undermine the authority of the science. One of the assertions made by the so-called sceptics against the scientific consensus on climate change is that because the science is so uncertain, there is no basis for taking action. The response of the climate change science community has been to develop in-depth analyses of uncertainty of increasing sophistication and complexity. In most areas of policy making, the normal situation is characterised by complexity, ambiguity and uncertainty. Therefore, dealing with uncertainty is not an unusual state of affairs for policy makers. However, the overemphasis given to uncertainty in the climate science discourse by scientists working in the field has been self-defeating as it has led to confusion among the intended recipients of the policy relevant scientific knowledge and allowed room for scepticism to grow. Climate change scientists should instead communicate and engage with policy makers (and the public) on those things that we know with confidence.

		Lawas, L. M. F.	Metabolic responses of rice cultivars with different tolerance to combined drought and heat stress under field conditions		GigaScience  	2019	volume 8, no. 5; pages 1-21.	Background Rice is susceptible to both drought and heat stress, in particular during flowering and grain filling, when both grain yield and quality may be severely compromised. However, under field conditions, these 2 stresses rarely occur separately. Under well-watered conditions, plants avoid heat stress by transpirational cooling, while this is not possible under drought conditions. Although investigating combined drought and heat stress is clearly more agronomically relevant than analyzing the effects of the single stresses, only a few studies of this stress combination, in particular under field conditions, have been published. Results Three rice cultivars differing in drought and heat tolerance were grown in the field under control and drought conditions in 3 consecutive years. Drought was applied either during flowering or during early grain filling and resulted in simultaneous heat stress, leading to reduced grain yield and quality. Analysis by gas chromatography−mass spectrometry showed distinct metabolic profiles for the 3 investigated organs (flag leaves, flowering spikelets, developing seeds). The metabolic stress responses of the plants also strongly differed between cultivars and organs. Correlation analysis identified potential metabolic markers for grain yield and quality under combined drought and heat stress from both stress-regulated metabolites and from metabolites with constitutive differences between the cultivars. Conclusions Gas chromatography−mass spectrometry resolved metabolic responses to combined drought and heat stress in different organs of field-grown rice. The metabolite profiles can be used to identify potential marker metabolites for yield stability and grain quality that are expected to improve breeding efforts towards developing rice cultivars that are resilient to climate change.

		Subedi, S. R.	Genome-wide association study reveals significant genomic regions for improving yield, adaptability of rice under dry direct seeded cultivation condition		BMC Genomics	2019	volume 20, no. 471; pages 1-20.	Background  Puddled transplanted system of rice cultivation despite having several benefits, is a highly labor, water and energy intensive system. In the face of changing climatic conditions, a successful transition from puddled to dry direct seeded rice (DDSR) cultivation system looks must in future. Genome-wide association study was performed for traits including, roots and nutrient uptake (14 traits), plant-morphological (5 traits), lodging-resistance (4 traits) and yield and yield attributing traits (7 traits) with the aim to identify significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) for traits enhancing rice adaptability to dry direct-seeded rice (DDSR) system.  Results  Study identified a total of 37 highly significant MTAs for 20 traits. The false discovery rate (FDR) ranged from 0.264 to 3.69 × 10− 4, 0.0330 to 1.25 × 10− 4, and 0.0534 to 4.60 × 10− 6 in 2015WS, 2016DS and combined analysis, respectively. The percent phenotypic variance (PV) explained by SNPs ranged from 9 to 92%. Among the identified significant MTAs, 15 MTAs associated with the traits including nodal root, root hair length, root length density, stem and culm diameter, plant height and grain yield were reported to be located in the proximity of earlier identified candidate gene. The significant positive correlation of grain-yield with seedling establishment traits, root morphological and nutrient-uptake related traits and grain yield attributing traits pointing towards combining target traits to increase rice yield and adaptability under DDSR. Seven promising progenies with better root morphology, nutrient-uptake and higher grain yield were identified that can further be used in genomics assisted breeding for DDSR varietal development.  Conclusions  Once validated, the identified MTAs and the SNPs linked with trait of interest could be of direct use in genomic assisted breeding (GAB) to improve grain yield and adaptability of rice under DDSR.

		Zeigler, Robert S.	Plant sciences, public policies and food security		Outlook on Agriculture	2019	(e-first copy); 9 pages.	Food security was a major global concern in the second half of the 20th century. A positive feedback loop between public policy and technological innovation created abundant food supplies that averted predictions of famine and social chaos. Following the successful global effort to combat hunger, policy attention turned to problems of the environmental footprint of agriculture and other nutrition and diet-related health problems. Policies are developed in response to challenges presented by technology-induced change. As the rate of technological change accelerates, policy makers struggle to keep up and policies risk becoming irrelevant or stymying positive impact of innovation. Public or philanthropic investments created the foundation for private investment in technologies that have been widely adopted. As the public sector reduces its investments in research and development, it is not clear that the private sector has the appetite or means to make the needed investments. Examples of challenges facing agriculture and food security include access to and use of genetic resources, genetically modified crops and the global community’s ability to respond to and mitigate human-induced climate change. Proposed solutions to the world’s many serious challenges almost invariably involve some kind of coordinated and coherent multilateral institutional actions. Yet, today, global political trends appear to be shifting to more unilateral, bilateral and nationalistic perspectives hampering our capacity to respond effectively.

		Tirol-Padre, A.	Site-specific feasibility of alternate wetting and drying as a greenhouse gas mitigation option in irrigated rice fields in Southeast Asia: a synthesis		Soil Science and Plant Nutrition 	2018	volume 64, no. 1; pages 2-13, ill. Ref.	This study comprises a comprehensive assessment, integration, and synthesis of data gathered from a 3-year field experiment conducted at four sites in Southeast Asia, namely Hue, Vietnam; Jakenan, Indonesia; Prachin Buri, Thailand; and Muñoz, Philippines, to assess the site-specific feasibility of alternate wetting and drying (AWD) as a greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation option in irrigated rice fields. AWD effectively reduced water use compared to continuous flooding (CF) but did not significantly reduce rice grain yield and soil carbon content in all sites. Methane (CH4) emissions varied significantly among sites and seasons as affected by soil properties and water management. AWD reduced CH4 emissions relative to CF by 151 (25%), 166 (37%), 9 (31%), and 22 (32%) kg CH4 ha−1 season−1 in Hue, Jakenan, Prachin Buri, and Muñoz, respectively. In Prachin Buri and Muñoz, AWD reduced CH4 emissions only during the dry season. Site-specific CH4 emission factors (EFs) ranged 0.13–4.50 and 0.08–4.88 kg CH4 ha−1 d−1 under CF and AWD, respectively. The mean AWD scaling factors (SFs) was 0.69 (95% confidence interval: 0.61–0.77), which is slightly higher than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’ SF for multiple aeration of 0.52 (error range: 0.41–0.66). Significant reductions in the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4+nitrous oxide (N2O) by AWD were observed in Hue and Jakenan (27.8 and 36.1%, respectively), where the contributions of N2O to the total GWP were only 0.8 and 3.5%, respectively. In Muñoz, however, CH4 emission reduction through AWD was offset by the increase in N2O emissions. The results indicate that the IPCC’s SF for multiple aeration may only be applied to irrigated rice fields where surface water level is controllable for a substantial period. This study underscores the importance of practical feasibility and appropriate timing of water management in successful GHG reductions by AWD.

		Ramirez-Villegas, J.	Breeding implications of drought stress under future climate for upland rice in Brazil		Global Change Biology  	2018	(e-first copy); 31 pages, ill. Ref.	Rice is the most important food crop in the developing world. For rice production systems to address the challenges of increasing demand and climate change, potential and on-farm yield increases must be increased. Breeding is one of the main strategies toward such aim. Here, we hypothesise that climatic and atmospheric changes for the upland rice growing period in central Brazil are likely to alter environment groupings and drought stress patterns by 2050, leading to changing breeding targets during the 21st century. As a result of changes in drought stress frequency and intensity, we found reductions in productivity in the range of 200-600 kg ha−1 (up to 20%) and reductions in yield stability throughout virtually the entire upland rice growing area (except for the south-east). In the face of these changes, our crop simulation analysis suggests that the current strategy of the breeding program, which aims at achieving wide adaptation, should be adjusted. Based on results for current and future climates, a weighted selection strategy for the three environmental groups that characterise the region is suggested. For the highly favourable environment (HFE, 36–41% growing area, depending on RCP), selection should be done under both stress-free and terminal stress conditions; for the favourable environment (FE, 27–40%), selection should aim at testing under reproductive and terminal stress; and for the least favourable environment (LFE, 23–27%), selection should be conducted for response to reproductive stress only and for the joint occurrence of reproductive and terminal stress. Even though there are differences in timing, it is noteworthy that stress levels are similar across environments, with 40–60% of crop water demand unsatisfied. Efficient crop improvement targeted toward adaptive traits for drought tolerance will enhance upland rice crop system resilience under climate change.

		Estoque, R. C.	Simultaneous comparison and assessment of eight remotely sensed maps of Philippine forests		International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation 	2018	volume 67; pages 123-134, ill. Ref. May	This article compares and assesses eight remotely sensed maps of Philippine forest cover in the year 2010. We examined eight Forest versus Non-Forest maps reclassified from eight land cover products: the Philippine Land Cover, the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Land Cover, the Landsat Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF), the MODIS VCF, the MODIS Land Cover Type product (MCD12Q1), the Global Tree Canopy Cover, the ALOS-PALSAR Forest/Non-Forest Map, and the GlobeLand30. The reference data consisted of 9852 randomly distributed sample points interpreted from Google Earth. We created methods to assess the maps and their combinations. Results show that the percentage of the Philippines covered by forest ranges among the maps from a low of 23% for the Philippine Land Cover to a high of 67% for GlobeLand30. Landsat VCF estimates 36% forest cover, which is closest to the 37% estimate based on the reference data. The eight maps plus the reference data agree unanimously on 30% of the sample points, of which 11% are attributable to forest and 19% to non-forest. The overall disagreement between the reference data and Philippine Land Cover is 21%, which is the least among the eight Forest versus Non-Forest maps. About half of the 9852 points have a nested structure such that the forest in a given dataset is a subset of the forest in the datasets that have more forest than the given dataset. The variation among the maps regarding forest quantity and allocation relates to the combined effects of the various definitions of forest and classification errors. Scientists and policy makers must consider these insights when producing future forest cover maps and when establishing benchmarks for forest cover monitoring.

		Aggarwal, P. K.	The climate-smart village approach: framework of an integrative strategy for scaling up adaptation options in agriculture		Ecology and Society  	2018	volume 23, no. 1; 15 pages	Increasing weather risks threaten agricultural production systems and food security across the world. Maintaining agricultural growth while minimizing climate shocks is crucial to building a resilient food production system and meeting developmental goals in vulnerable countries. Experts have proposed several technological, institutional, and policy interventions to help farmers adapt to current and future weather variability and to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents the climate-smart village (CSV) approach as a means of performing agricultural research for development that robustly tests technological and institutional options for dealing with climatic variability and climate change in agriculture using participatory methods. It aims to scale up and scale out the appropriate options and draw out lessons for policy makers from local to global levels. The approach incorporates evaluation of climate-smart technologies, practices, services, and processes relevant to local climatic risk management and identifies opportunities for maximizing adaptation gains from synergies across different interventions and recognizing potential maladaptation and trade-offs. It ensures that these are aligned with local knowledge and link into development plans. This paper describes early results in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to illustrate different examples of the CSV approach in diverse agroecological settings. Results from initial studies indicate that the CSV approach has a high potential for scaling out promising climate-smart agricultural technologies, practices, and services. Climate analog studies indicate that the lessons learned at the CSV sites would be relevant to adaptation planning in a large part of global agricultural land even under scenarios of climate change. Key barriers and opportunities for further work are also discussed.

		Rao, A. N.	Weed research issues, challenges, and opportunities in India		Crop Protection	2018	(e-first copy): 8 pages, ill. Ref.	Agriculture is the major source of livelihood for nearly half of the Indian population. However, the productivity of crops is much lower than many countries and needs enhancement to produce ∼400 million tons of food grains for meeting food demands of a population of 1.7 billion by 2050. Diverse climatic conditions in India favor the most adopted weeds to prevail and cause severe crop yield losses. Weeds also degrade quality of the produce, raise cost of production; harbor and serve as alternate hosts to several insect pests and diseases. Parthenium hysterophorus L Phalaris minor Retz Leptochloa chinensis (L.) Nees Echinochloa spp weedy rice; Lantana camara L Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M. King & H. Rob Mikania micrantha Kunth., are a few of many major weeds of concern currently in India. Weed management in India is critical to improve crops productivity by minimizing weeds caused crop yield losses and to alleviate other adverse effects of weeds in different ecosystems. In spite of the progress made in evolving weed management technologies for different crops and other ecosystems, weeds continue to be a concern in varying ecosystems. The real challenges of Indian weed research are: managing weeds in small farms; non availability of labor and mechanical tools; inadequate information on weed biology and shifts in weed flora; herbicide resistant weeds; lack of understanding on the impact of climate change on weeds and weed control; popularizing integrated weed management with herbicides use by ensuring safe use to avoid adverse effect on human health, environment and avoid weeds developing herbicide resistance and prevention of entry and management of alien invasive weeds. The greatest opportunity of Indian weed science is the potentiality of appropriate weed management technologies to substantially improve the crops productivity. Thus, weed scientists have a greater role to play in the development, popularization and adoption of location specific effective, economical and eco-friendly weed management technologies for different ecosystems of India.

		Fuhrmann, I.	Nitrogen fertilizer fate after introducing maize and upland-rice into continuous paddy rice cropping systems		Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment	2018	volume 258; pages 162-171, ill. Ref.	Water scarcity and economic incentives favor the introduction of upland crops into permanent paddy rice systems during dry seasons. However, introducing upland crops into permanently flooded cropping systems temporarily changes soil conditions from anaerobic to aerobic, affecting nitrogen (N) dynamics profoundly. We hypothesized that under maize and dry rice, total fertilizer 15N recovery in soil as well as the immobilization of fertilizer 15N in microbial residues is reduced compared with continuous paddy rice cropping. Furthermore, we expected enhanced emissions of fertilizer 15N in form of nitrous oxide (N2O) under maize and dry rice. To test these hypotheses, we traced the fate of a 15N-urea pulse in a field experiment in the Philippines with three different crop rotations: continuous paddy rice, paddy rice – dry rice, and paddy rice – maize for two years. Indeed, the 15N recovery in the first 5 cm of bulk soil was lowest in the paddy rice – maize rotation (arithmetic mean with standard error: 19.2 ± 1.8% of applied 15N), while twice as much was recovered in the first 5 cm of bulk soil of the continuous paddy rice cropping systems (37.8 ± 2.2% of applied 15N) during the first dry season. The 15N recovery in the plant biomass (shoots and roots) in the continuous paddy rice cropping was 13% larger than in the dry rice plant biomass and 5% larger than in the maize plant biomass during the first dry season. Fertilizer 15N remained longest in paddy rice – maize (mean residence time = 90 ± 25 days) and in continuous paddy rice (mean residence time = 77 ± 30 days), compared with dry rice – paddy rice rotation (mean residence time = 16 ± 5 days). After 2 years, 10% (paddy rice – dry rice, paddy rice – maize) to 23% (continuous paddy rice) of the applied fertilizer 15N were still stored in soil. The largest fraction of this 15N was immobilized by soil microbes, which stored 3–4% of applied 15N in the form of amino sugars as specific cell wall constituents, in all cropping systems. Nevertheless, introducing upland crops into continuous paddy rice systems likely increased N leaching losses and resulted in initial losses of urea- 15N to N2O, which thus has to be considered in climate smart mitigation strategies	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Continuous cropping;Cropping systems;Fertilizers;Maize;Nutrient use efficiency;Upland rice	Rice thesaurus	He, Y.;Lehndorff, E.;Brüggemann, N.;Amelung, W.;Wassmann, R.;Siemens, J.	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.02.021	https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B-Hz5UNUXAiWdmF3SFdqRl92UFE	View the full text	lcc	JA

Abstract WHO reported climate change already takes 150,000 casualties annually, due to the emergence of various diseases and malnutrition caused by food shortages and disasters. Rice is the staple food for almost all of Indonesian citizens, therefore Zn biofortification on rice is expected to be effective, efficient, massive, and sustainable to overcome the Zn nutritional deficiency. This study aims to identify rice with high Zn content and yield for further effort in releasing this variety. Ten lines along with two varieties as a comparison (Ciherang and Inpari 5 Merawu) were tested in Plumbon Village, Mojolaban Subdistrict, Sukoharjo Regency during February-May 2017. The experiment was designed in a Randomized Completely Block Design with four replications on a 4 m x 5 m area, with 25 cm x 25 cm plant spacing using seedling transplanting techniques of 21 days old seeds. The results showed that the plant genotypes treated had differences in yield characteristics, heading date, harvest age, panicle number, filled and un-filled grain per panicle, seed set, 1000 grains weight, Zn and Iron (Fe) content in rice grain. B13884-MR-29-1-1 line (30.94 ppm Zn, 15.84 ppm Fe, 4.11 ton/ha yield) and IR 97477- 115-1-CRB-0-SKI-1-SKI-0-2 (29.61 ppm Zn, 13.49 ppm Zn, 4.4 ton/ha yield) are prospective variety to be released.

		Scheben, A.	Progress in single-access information systems for wheat and rice crop improvement		Briefings in Bioinformatics  	2018	pages 1-7, ill. Ref.	Abstract Improving productivity of the staple crops wheat and rice is essential to feed the growing global population, particularly in the context of a changing climate. However, current rates of yield gain are insufficient to support the predicted population growth. New approaches are required to accelerate the breeding process, and many of these are driven by the application of large-scale crop data. To leverage the substantial volumes and types of data that can be applied for precision breeding, the wheat and rice research communities are working towards the development of integrated systems to access and standardize the dispersed, heterogeneous available data. Here, we outline the initiatives of the International Wheat Information System (WheatIS) and the International Rice Informatics Consortium (IRIC) to establish Web-based single-access systems and data mining tools to make the available resources more accessible, drive discovery and accelerate the production of new crop varieties. We discuss the progress of WheatIS and IRIC towards unifying specialized wheat and rice databases and building custom software platforms to manage and interrogate these data. Single-access crop information systems will strengthen scientific collaboration, optimize the use of public research funds and help achieve the required yield gains in the two most important global food crops.

		Abdalla, K.	Grassland degradation significantly enhances soil CO2 emission		Catena	2018	volume 167, pages 284-292, ill. Ref.	Grassland degradation not only results in soil degradation and severe decreases in land productivity, but also can promote the emission of soil carbon and nitrogen compounds as greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The primary objective of this study was to characterize the impact of grassland degradation on carbon and nitrogen budgets in Inner Mongolia, China. We investigated the changes of total carbon, organic carbon, inorganic carbon and total nitrogen that occur in a grassland ecosystem (including vegetation and top 30 cm soil layer) in the course of grassland degradation. Total carbon stored in the grassland ecosystem was reduced by up to 14%, depending on the severity of the degradation. Total nitrogen storage was reduced by almost 10% under severe degradation, but was slightly increased at light and intermediate degradation, indicating that grazing exclusion would not lead to an increase in nitrogen storage in the ecosystem. Over 98% of the total carbon and nitrogen stored in the grassland ecosystem was bound in the soil which provides the dominant and most stable carbon and nitrogen pool in the ecosystem. Most of the soil carbon and nitrogen storage was present in soil water-stable aggregates and was released as soil water-stable aggregates break in the course of grassland degradation. In conclusion, the carbon sequestration capacity of the vegetation decreased significantly, and substantial proportions of soil carbon and nitrogen were lost in the course of grassland degradation, resulting in unbalanced carbon and nitrogen budgets. Strategies to restore degraded grassland must be designed to increase the carbon and nitrogen storage potential of grassland ecosystems.

		Kumar. A.	Marker-assisted selection strategy to pyramid two or more QTLs for quantitative trait-grain yield under drought		Rice 	2018	volume 11, no. 35; 16 pages.	Abstract Background  Marker-assisted breeding will move forward from introgressing single/multiple genes governing a single trait to multiple genes governing multiple traits to combat emerging biotic and abiotic stresses related to climate change and to enhance rice productivity. MAS will need to address concerns about the population size needed to introgress together more than two genes/QTLs. In the present study, grain yield and genotypic data from different generations (F3 to F8) for five marker-assisted breeding programs were analyzed to understand the effectiveness of synergistic effect of phenotyping and genotyping in early generations on selection of better progenies.  Results  Based on class analysis of the QTL combinations, the identified superior QTL classes in F3/BC1F3/BC2F3 generations with positive QTL x QTL and QTL x background interactions that were captured through phenotyping maintained its superiority in yield under non-stress (NS) and reproductive-stage drought stress (RS) across advanced generations in all five studies. The marker-assisted selection breeding strategy combining both genotyping and phenotyping in early generation significantly reduced the number of genotypes to be carried forward. The strategy presented in this study providing genotyping and phenotyping cost savings of 25–68% compared with the traditional marker-assisted selection approach. The QTL classes, Sub1 + qDTY 1.1  + qDTY 2.1  + qDTY 3.1 and Sub1 + qDTY 2.1  + qDTY 3.1 in Swarna-Sub1, Sub1 + qDTY 1.1  + qDTY 1.2 , Sub1 + qDTY 1.1  + qDTY 2.2 and Sub1 + qDTY 2.2  + qDTY 12.1 in IR64-Sub1, qDTY 2.2  + qDTY 4.1 in Samba Mahsuri, Sub1 + qDTY 3.1  + qDTY 6.1  + qDTY 6.2 and Sub1 + qDTY 6.1  + qDTY 6.2 in TDK1-Sub1 and qDTY 12.1  + qDTY 3.1 and qDTY 2.2  + qDTY 3.1 in MR219 had shown better and consistent performance under NS and RS across generations over other QTL classes.  Conclusion  “Deployment of this procedure will save time and resources and will allow breeders to focus and advance only germplasm with high probability of improved performance. The identification of superior QTL classes and capture of positive QTL x QTL and QTL x background interactions in early generation and their consistent performance in subsequent generations across five backgrounds supports the efficacy of a combined MAS breeding strategy”.

		Fisher, E.	Index insurance and climate risk management: addressing social equity		Development Policy Review  	2019	volume 37; pages 581-602, ill. Ref.	Fair distribution of benefits from index insurance matters. Lack of attention to social equity can reinforce inequalities and undermine the potential index insurance holds as a tool for climate risk management that is also pro‐poor.  Purpose  The aims are to: (i) examine social equity concerns raised by index insurance in the context of climate risk management; (ii) consider how greater attention can be given to social equity in index insurance initiatives; and (iii) reflect on the policy challenges raised by taking social equity into account as a mechanism for climate risk reduction.  Approach and methods  The article draws on learning from the CGIAR's Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and presents the cases of the Index Based Livelihoods Insurance (IBLI) and Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise Ltd. (ACRE) in East Africa. It proposes a framework for unpacking social equity related to equitable access, procedures, representation and distribution within index insurance schemes.  Findings  Systematically addressing social equity raises hard policy choices for index insurance initiatives without straightforward solutions. Attention to how benefits and burdens of index insurance are distributed raises the unpalateable truth for development policy that the poorest members of rural society can be excluded. Nevertheless, a focus on social equity may open up opportunities to ensure index insurance is linked to more socially just climate risk management. At the very least, it may prevent index insurance from generating greater inequality. Taking social equity into account, thus, shifts the focus from agricultural systems in transition per se to systems with potential to incorporate societal transformation through distributive justice.  Policy implications  A framework is presented for unpacking different dimensions of social equity in index insurance schemes. It is intended to facilitate identification of opportunities for building outcomes that are more equitable, with greater potential for inclusion and fairer distribution of benefits related to index insurance.

		Silva, J. C.	Intensification of rice-based farming systems in Central Luzon, Philippines: Constraints at field, farm and regional levels		Agricultural Systems 	2018	volume 165; pages 55-70.	Abstract Understanding the opportunities for sustainable intensification requires an integrated assessment at field, farm and regional levels of past developments. Two hypotheses regarding current rice production in Central Luzon (Philippines) were developed for this purpose. First, we hypothesize that there are trade-offs between rice yields, labour productivity, gross margin and N use efficiency and, second, that farm(er) characteristics and socio-economic conditions at farm and regional level affect the management practices used by farmers. These hypotheses were tested using two household surveys characterizing rice-based farming systems in Central Luzon in terms of changes over time (1966–2012) and spatial variability. Over the past half-century there was an increase in the proportion of irrigated fields and adoption of improved varieties, which allowed the cultivation of a dry season rice crop in Central Luzon. Moreover, transplanting has been replaced by direct-seeding and herbicides substituted hand-weeding. These resulted in greater rice yields and labour productivity, and contributed to gradual transition from subsistence to commercial farming systems, as observed in the increasing proportion of hired labour and rice sold. Our results indicate the existence of a trade-off between rice yields, labour productivity and N use efficiency as yield levels maximising labour productivity and N use efficiency were ca. 25% and 35% lower than climatic potential yield in the wet and dry season, respectively. At field level, this can be explained by 1) the use of transplanting as crop establishment method, which resulted into higher yields but lower labour productivity as compared to direct-seeding, and 2) the high N application levels, which led to higher yields but lower N use efficiency. In contrast, yield levels which maximised gross margin were ca. 80% of the climatic potential in both wet and dry seasons, so there was little trade-off between rice yields and economic performance. Regarding the second hypothesis results were not always conclusive. As an example, N application per ha was negatively associated with farm size and the timing of the first fertiliser application positively associated with household size and with the number of parcels. More intensive practices, and better farm performance, were recorded in the province at the heart of the irrigation system. We thus conclude that closing rice yield gaps in the production systems of Central Luzon incurs trade-offs with environmental and social objectives at field and farm levels but less with economic objectives. However, we could not clearly show whether, and to what extent, management practices used by farmers are influenced by farm or regional level constraints.

		Hellin, J.	Increasing social-ecological resilience within small-scale agriculture in conflict-affected Guatemala		Ecology and Society 	2018	volume 23, no. 3; 5 (11 pages).	ABSTRACT Climate change scenarios suggest largely detrimental impacts on agricultural production from a deterioration of renewable natural resources. Over the last 15 years, a new field of research has focused on the interactions between climate and conflict risk, particularly as it relates to competition over natural resources and livelihoods. Within this field, there has been less attention to the potential for resource competition to be managed in ways that yield greater cooperation, local adaptation capacity, social-ecological resilience, and conflict mitigation or prevention. The challenge of increasing social-ecological resilience in small-scale agriculture is particularly acute in the socioeconomically and agroecologically marginalized Western Highlands of Guatemala. Not only is climate change a threat to agriculture in this region, but adaptation strategies are challenged by the context of a society torn apart by decades of violent conflict. Indeed, the largely indigenous population in the Western Highlands has suffered widespread discrimination for centuries. The armed conflict has left a legacy of a deeply divided society, with communities often suspicious of outsider interventions and in many cases with neighbors pitted against each other. We use the example of the Buena Milpa agricultural development project to demonstrate how grassroots approaches to collective action, conflict prevention, and social-ecological resilience, linking local stakeholder dynamics to the broader institutional and governance context, can bear fruit amidst postconflict development challenges. Examples of microwatershed management and conservation of local maize varieties illustrate opportunities to foster community-level climate adaptation strategies within small-scale farming systems even in deeply divided societies.

		Dinesh, D.	Facilitating change for climate-smart agriculture through science-policy engagement		Sustainability  	2018	volume 10; 2616 (21 pages)	Climate change impacts on agriculture have become evident, and threaten the achievement of global food security. On the other hand, the agricultural sector itself is a cause of climate change, and if actions are not taken, the sector might impede the achievement of global climate goals. Science-policy engagement efforts are crucial to ensure that scientific findings from agricultural research for development inform actions of governments, private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international development partners, accelerating progress toward global goals. However, knowledge gaps on what works limit progress. In this paper, we analyzed 34 case studies of science-policy engagement efforts, drawn from six years of agricultural research for development efforts around climate-smart agriculture by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). Based on lessons derived from these case studies, we critically assessed and refined the program theory of the CCAFS program, leading to a revised and improved program theory for science-policy engagement for agriculture research for development under climate change. This program theory offers a pragmatic pathway to enhance credibility, salience and legitimacy of research, which relies on engagement (participatory and demand-driven research processes), evidence (building scientific credibility while adopting an opportunistic and flexible approach) and outreach (effective communication and capacity building).

		Sibiko, K. W.	Small farmers’ preferences for weather index insurance: insights from Kenya		Agriculture and Food Security	2018	volume 7, no. 53; 14 pages	Abstract Background  Smallholder farmers in developing countries are particularly vulnerable to climate shocks but often lack access to agricultural insurance. Weather index insurance (WII) could reduce some of the problems associated with traditional, indemnity-based insurance programs, but uptake has been lower than expected. One reason is that WII contracts are not yet sufficiently tailored to the needs and preferences of smallholder farmers. This study combines survey and choice-experimental data from Kenya to analyze the experience with an existing WII program and how specific changes in the contractual design might encourage uptake.  Results  Many smallholders struggle with fully understanding the functioning of the program, which undermines their confidence. Regular provision of relevant rainfall measurements and thresholds would significantly increase farmers’ willingness to pay for WII. Mechanisms to reduce basis risk are also positively valued by farmers, although not to the same extent as higher levels of transparency. Finally, offering contracts to small groups rather than individual farmers could increase insurance uptake.  Conclusions  Better training on WII and regular communication are needed.

		Caine, R. S.	Rice with reduced stomatal density conserves water and has improved drought tolerance under future climate conditions		New Phytologist	2018	(e-first copy): 14 pages	Summary Much of humanity relies on rice (Oryza sativa) as a food source, but cultivation is water intensive and the crop is vulnerable to drought and high temperatures. Under climate change, periods of reduced water availability and high temperature are expected to become more frequent, leading to detrimental effects on rice yields. We engineered the high‐yielding rice cultivar ‘IR64’ to produce fewer stomata by manipulating the level of a developmental signal. We overexpressed the rice epidermal patterning factor OsEPF1, creating plants with substantially reduced stomatal density and correspondingly low stomatal conductance. Low stomatal density rice lines were more able to conserve water, using c. 60% of the normal amount between weeks 4 and 5 post germination. When grown at elevated atmospheric CO2, rice plants with low stomatal density were able to maintain their stomatal conductance and survive drought and high temperature (40°C) for longer than control plants. Low stomatal density rice gave equivalent or even improved yields, despite a reduced rate of photosynthesis in some conditions. Rice plants with fewer stomata are drought tolerant and more conservative in their water use, and they should perform better in the future when climate change is expected to threaten food security.

		Mishra, A. K.	Perception of climate change and impact on land allocation and income: empirical evidence from Vietnam's Delta Region		Agricultural and Resource Economics Review 	2018	(e-first copy): 25 pages.	Using a sample survey from Vietnam's M&RRD, this study examines both the factors affecting smallholder households’ perceptions of climate change, and the impact of climatic change on smallholders’ income and land allocation decisions. Results show a significant and negative impact of perception of climate change on income of smallholder households. Smallholders with perceived climate changes reduce land allocated to paddy crop. Farmers make strategic decision to counter the negative effects of climate change by increasing the amount of rented land for paddy crop production, while at the same time decreasing the amount of owned land allocated to paddy crop.

		Kretzschmar, T.	DNA fingerprinting at farm level maps rice biodiversity across Bangladesh and reveals regional varietal preferences		Scientific Reports 	2018	volume 8, no. 14920; 12 pages	The development, dissemination, and adoption of improved rice varieties are imperative for global food and nutritional security. Knowledge of the crop’s distribution across agro-ecologies is important for impact assessment studies, varietal replacement strategies, and the development and implementation of agricultural policies. Bangladesh is the world’s 4th largest rice producer. Though traditional varieties (TVs) are abundant and valued throughout Bangladesh, population growth and vulnerability to climate change, necessitate efficient deployment of high-yielding stress-tolerant modern varieties (MVs). To aid agricultural policy and strategy this study aimed to accurately assess the distribution of MVs and TVs across Bangladesh during the rainfed rice-growing season. Information derived from a survey of rice production areas were compared and combined with DNA fingerprinting information from the same locations. Biodiversity of Bangladesh rice remained high. While TVs and first generation MVs of Bangladeshi and Indian origin were still commonly grown, recently released stress-tolerant MVs were adopted in large proportions in several districts. Although farmers successfully distinguished TVs from MVs grown in their fields, a considerable lack of authenticity among MVs was observed, pinpointing shortcomings in the seed supply chain. This study identifies focal points for extension work and validates DNA fingerprinting as reliable method for impact assessment studies.

		Tariq, A.	Paddy soil drainage influences residue carbon contribution to methane emissions		Journal of Environmental Management  	2018	volume 225, no. 1; pages 168-176.	Abstract Water drainage is an important mitigation option for reducing CH4 (methane) emissions from residue-amended paddy soils. Several studies have indicated a long-term reduction in CH4 emissions, even after re-flooding, suggesting that the mechanism goes beyond creating temporary oxidized conditions in the soil. In this pot trial, the effects of different drainage patterns on straw-derived CH4 and CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions were compared to identify the balance between straw-carbon CH4 and CO2 emissions influenced by soil aeration over different periods, including effects of drainage on emissions during re-flooding. The water treatments included were: continuous flooding [C] as the control and five drainage patterns (pre-planting drainage [P], early-season drainage [E], midseason drainage [M], pre-planting plus midseason drainage [PM], early-season-plus-midseason drainage [EM]). An equal amount of 13C-enriched rice straw was applied to all treatments to identify straw-derived 13C-gas emissions from soil carbon derived emissions.  The highest fluxes of CH4 and δ13C-CH4 were recorded from the control treatment in the first week after straw application. The CH4 flux and δ13C-CH4 were reduced the most (0.1–0.8 μg CH4 g−1 soil day−1 and -13 to −34‰) in the pre-planting and pre-planting plus midseason drainage treatments at day one after transplanting. Total and straw-derived CH4 emissions were reduced by 69% and 78% in pre-planting drainage and 77% and 87% in pre-planting plus midseason drainage respectively, compared to control. The early-season, midseason, pre-planting plus midseason and early-season-plus-midseason drainage treatments resulted in higher total and straw-derived CO2 emissions compared to the control and pre-planting drainage treatments. The pre-planting and pre-planting plus midseason drainage treatments lowered the global warming potential by 47–53%, and early-season and early-season-plus-midseason drainage treatments reduced it by 24–31% compared to control. By using labelled crop residues, this experiment demonstrates a direct link between early drainage and reduced CH4 emissions from incorporated crop residues, eventually leading to a reduction in total global warming potential. It is suggested that accelerated decomposition of the residues during early season drainage prolonged the reduction in CH4 emissions. Therefore, it is important to introduce the early drainage as an effective measure to mitigate CH4 emissions from crop residues.

		Mottaleb, K. A.	Benefits of the development and dissemination of climate-smart rice: ex ante impact assessment of drought-tolerant rice in South Asia		In: Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change  	2017	volume 22, pages 879-901, ill. Ref.	In the era of climate change, rice (Oryza sativa L.) production is increasingly affected by the rising frequency and severity of various abiotic stresses such as flood and drought. In some cases, 100 % yield loss can be attributed solely to these stresses. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop climate-smart rice that is more resilient to abiotic stresses. As the development and dissemination of climate-smart rice varieties entail costs, this article examines the net economic benefits of developing and disseminating successful drought-tolerant rice in South Asia where rice area prone to drought far outweighs area with other abiotic stresses. Drought causes major rice yield losses not only in South Asia but also in other parts of Asia and Africa. Using the ORYZA2000 (ORYZA model series were developed at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the early 1990s in collaboration with Wageningen University and Research Centre (WUR) and 16 national agricultural research and extension systems in Asia.

		Kumar, U.	Analysis and simulation of phenotypic plasticity for traits contributing to yield potential in twelve rice genotypes		Field Crop Research  	2016		High-yielding rice varieties (HYV) show strong phenotypic plasticity, notably in compensatory tiller production and panicle size. In a precursor study on the high-tillering cv. IR72 we showed that the plasticity is adaptive by enabling yield stability across different stand densities, and we presented and validated the functional-structural crop model SAMARA, developed for the study of phenotypic plasticity. The present study analyses the phenotypic plasticity of high and low tillering plant types. Twelve contrasting, high-yielding irrigated rice genotypes were studied for the plasticity of traits contributing to grain yield under different season/site environments and stand densities in the Philippines. For the density factor, sequentially developing yield components along phenology, beginning with tillering, showed decreasing plasticity, indicating progressive adjustment to the initial stand density. For the site/season factor (climate), tillering was less plastic and panicle size and grain filling ratio provided for the strongest adjustments. Large plasticity was observed also for LAI and little plasticity for SLA and leaf morphology, particularly blade width. Genotypes differed strongly in organ size vs. number (leaves, panicles), representing organ “number” or “size” plant types. Up to 10 Mg ha−1 grain yield were observed for both extreme types. The plasticity of panicle size was caused by variation in spikelet number and not kernel weight. All genotypes were able to fully adjust yield components to differential plant stand density, resulting in unchanged yield. However, between environments, genotypes having greatest maximal yields and those having stable (but on average smaller) yields showed different patterns of phenotypic plasticity for yield component and plant morphology traits. The SAMARA model was calibrated for five genotypes showing contrasting morphology and plasticity. It was able to predict most of the genotypes’ variation in morphological and yield component traits. Future opportunities to predict improved rice ideotypes for changing environments and cultural practices through combined field experimentation and modelling are discussed.

		Gaydon, D. S.	Evaluation of the APSIM model in cropping systems of Asia		Field Crop Research	2017	volume 204; pages 52-75, ill. Ref.	Resource shortages, driven by climatic, institutional and social changes in many regions of Asia, combined with growing imperatives to increase food production whilst ensuring environmental sustainability, are driving research into modified agricultural practices. Well-tested cropping systems models that capture interactions between soil water and nutrient dynamics, crop growth, climate and farmer management can assist in the evaluation of such new agricultural practices. One such cropping systems model is the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). We evaluated APSIM’s ability to simulate the performance of cropping systems in Asia from several perspectives: crop phenology, production, water use, soil dynamics (water and organic carbon) and crop CO2 response, as well as its ability to simulate cropping sequences without reset of soil variables. The evaluation was conducted over a diverse range of environments (12 countries, numerous soils), crops and management practices throughout the region. APSIM’s performance was statistically assessed against assembled replicated experimental datasets. Once properly parameterised, the model performed well in simulating the diversity of cropping systems to which it was applied with RMSEs generally less than observed experimental standard deviations (indicating robust model performance), and with particular strength in simulation of multi-crop sequences. Input parameter estimation challenges were encountered, and although ‘work-arounds’ were developed and described, in some cases these actually represent model deficiencies which need to be addressed. Desirable future improvements have been identified to better position APSIM as a useful tool for Asian cropping systems research into the future. These include aspects related to harsh environments (high temperatures, diffuse light conditions, salinity, and submergence), conservation agriculture, greenhouse gas emissions, as well as aspects more specific to Southern Asia and low input systems (such as deficiencies in soil micro-nutrients).

		Lafarge, T.	Genome-wide association analysis for heat tolerance at flowering detected a large set of genes involved in adaptation to thermal and other stresses		PLOS ONE  	2017	volume 12, no. 2; 27 pages, ill. Ref.	Fertilization sensitivity to heat in rice is a major issue within climate change scenarios in the tropics. A panel of 167 indica landraces and improved varieties was phenotyped for spikelet sterility (SPKST) under 38°C during anthesis and for several secondary traits potentially affecting panicle micro-climate and thus the fertilization process. The panel was genotyped with an average density of one marker per 29 kb using genotyping by sequencing. Genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) were conducted using three methods based on single marker regression, haplotype regression and simultaneous fitting of all markers, respectively. Fourteen loci significantly associated with SPKST under at least two GWAS methods were detected. A large number of associations was also detected for the secondary traits. Analysis of co-localization of SPKST associated loci with QTLs detected in progenies of bi-parental crosses reported in the literature allowed to narrow -down the position of eight of those QTLs, including the most documented one, qHTSF4.1. Gene families underlying loci associated with SPKST corresponded to functions ranging from sensing abiotic stresses and regulating plant response, such as wall-associated kinases and heat shock proteins, to cell division and gametophyte development. Analysis of diversity at the vicinity of loci associated with SPKST within the rice three thousand genomes, revealed widespread distribution of the favourable alleles across O. sativa genetic groups. However, few accessions assembled the favourable alleles at all loci. Effective donors included the heat tolerant variety N22 and some Indian and Taiwanese varieties. These results provide a basis for breeding for heat tolerance during anthesis and for functional validation of major loci governing this trait.

Although Vietnam is one of the biggest rice exporters today, there is an urgent need to restructure the sector. To guide the transition from being a quantity-focused producer to a credible supplier of quality rice, this study explores the sector’s opportunities for sustainable value chain upgrading. Data was collected through focus group discussions with farmers, stacked surveys with rice value chain stakeholders, and a participatory workshop bringing several value chain actors together. Stakeholders perceive the sector’s capability to grasp opportunities (including growing export and domestic markets) to be higher than its resilience to potential threats (including more stringent food safety regulations and climate change). Three strategies are discussed for making rice value chains more sustainable; embodying sustainability in the product through certified sustainable production labels; internalizing sustainable production standards through vertical coordination (e.g., contract farming); and disembodying sustainability through book and claim certificate trading.

		Ismail, A. M.	Genomics, physiology, and molecular breeding approaches for improving salt tolerance		Annual Review of Plant Biology 	2017	volume 68; 30 pages, ill. Ref.	Salt stress reduces land and water productivity and contributes to poverty and food insecurity. Increased salinization caused by human practices and climate change is progressively reducing agriculture productivity despite escalating calls for more food. Plant responses to salt stress are fairly well understood, involving numerous critical processes that are each controlled by multiple genes. Knowledge of the critical mechanisms controlling salt uptake and exclusion from functioning tissues, signaling of salt stress, and the arsenal of protective metabolites is advancing. However, little progress has been made in developing salt-tolerant varieties of crop species using standard (but slow) breeding approaches. The genetic diversity available within cultivated crops and their wild relatives provides rich sources for trait and gene discovery that has yet to be sufficiently utilized. Transforming this knowledge into modern approaches using genomics and molecular tools for precision breeding will accelerate the development of tolerant cultivars and help sustain food production.

Elucidating the genetic control of rooting behaviour under water-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 indica genotypes grown under control and water-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving ~45,000 root scanning images and nearly ~25,000 cross-sections from the root-shoot junction. Phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under water-deficit compared to control conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high quality SNPs. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under control condition, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (control), 284 (water-deficit stress) and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that upon validation can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.

		Kikuchi, S.	Genome-wide association mapping for phenotypic plasticity in rice		Plant Cell And Environment 	2017	volume 40, no. 8; pages 1565-1575, ill. Ref.	Phenotypic plasticity of plants in response to environmental changes is important for adapting to changing climate. Less attention has been paid to exploring the advantages of phenotypic plasticity in resource-rich environments to enhance the productivity of agricultural crops. Here, we examined genetic variation for phenotypic plasticity in indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) across two diverse panels: (1) a Phenomics of Rice Adaptation and Yield (PRAY) population comprising 301 accessions; and (2) a Multi-parent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) indica population comprising 151 accessions. Altered planting density was used as a proxy for elevated atmospheric CO2 response. Low planting density significantly increased panicle weight per plant compared with normal density, and the magnitude of the increase ranged from 1.10 to 2.78 times among accessions for the PRAY population and from 1.05 to 2.45 times for the MAGIC population. Genome-wide-association studies validate three Environmental Responsiveness (ER) candidate alleles (qER1-3) that were associated with relative response of panicle weight to low density. Two of these alleles were tested in 13 genotypes to clarify their biomass responses during vegetative growth under elevated CO2 in Japan. Our study provides evidence for polymorphisms that control rice phenotypic plasticity in environments that are rich in resources such as light and CO2.

On-farm evaluation of dry-seeded rice cultivars and cropping systems in the semi-arid region of India		Philippine Journal of Science 146, no. 3 (2017): 223-235.	2017	volume 146, no. 3; pages 223-235, ill. Ref.	Improving and sustaining rice-based cropping systems in the semi-arid region are essential in persistent drought condition triggered by worsening effects of climate change and declining water availability. This on-farm study was conducted to evaluate and identify the most productive, resource- efficient and profitable direct dry-seeded rice (DDSR) cultivars, and DDSR-based cropping systems in the semi-arid region particularly in water-short irrigated rice areas. Farmer participatory field studies were conducted in Raichur District of Karnataka State, India to assess the performance of DDSR cultivars ( Samba Mahsuri, Gangavathi Sona and Prasanna ) seeded during the rainy season in rotation with dryland crops (chickpea, mustard and green gram) following rice. Among the three rice cultivars, Gangavathi Sona yielded 9% and 15% higher than Samba Mahsuri and Prasanna, respectively. Our study showed that productivity of rice can be improved by using drought resistant and high yielding cultivars with high harvest index, and stable canal water supply at the reproductive stage. Chickpea and green gram yielded better than mustard under minimal soil aeration conditions of zero-tilled and non-puddled fields which indicate that suitable post-rainy season crops for zero- tilled fields must be selected. The study revealed that sowing time, which depends on rainfall pattern and schedule of canal water supply, is among the major factors to be considered in selecting rice cultivars and dryland crops to achieve higher productivity, resource use efficiency and economic returns. Cropping system involving direct dry-seeding of Gangavathi Sona, followed by chickpea achieved higher production efficiency, land and water productivity, and economic returns compared to transplanted rice (TPR) system. Improving the productivity of chickpea and other suitable dryland crops that can be grown after rice in zero-tilled fields will contribute substantially to the evolving impacts of DDSR-based cropping systems in the semi-arid region.

The networks of crop breeders who exchange resistance genes and deploy them in varieties help to determine the global landscape of resistance and epidemics, an important system for maintaining food security. These networks function as a complex adaptive system, with associated strengths and vulnerabilities, and implications for policies to support resistance gene deployment strategies. Extensions of epidemic network analysis can be used to evaluate the multilayer agricultural networks that support and influence crop breeding networks. Here, we evaluate the general structure of crop breeding networks for cassava, potato, rice, and wheat. All four are clustered due to phytosanitary and intellectual property regulations, and linked through CGIAR hubs. Cassava networks primarily include public breeding groups, whereas others are more mixed. These systems must adapt to global change in climate and land use, the emergence of new diseases, and disruptive breeding technologies. Research priorities to support policy include how best to maintain both diversity and redundancy in the roles played by individual crop breeding groups (public versus private and global versus local), and how best to manage connectivity to optimize resistance gene deployment while avoiding risks to the useful life of resistance genes.

		Zhang, T.	Impacts of aerosol pollutant mitigation on lowland rice yields in China		Environmental Research Letters	2017	volume 12, no. 104003; pages 1-11, ill. Ref.	Aerosol pollution in China is significantly altering radiative transfer processes and is thereby potentially affecting rice photosynthesis and yields. However, the response of rice photosynthesis to aerosol-induced radiative perturbations is still not well understood. Here, we employ a process-based modelling approach to simulate changes in incoming radiation (RAD) and the diffuse radiation fraction (DF) with aerosol mitigation in China and their associated impacts on rice yields. Aerosol reduction has the positive effect of increasing RAD and the negative effect of decreasing DF on rice photosynthesis and yields. In rice production areas where the average RAD during the growing season is lower than 250 W m−2, aerosol reduction is beneficial for higher rice yields, whereas in areas with RAD>250 W m−2, aerosol mitigation causes yield declines due to the associated reduction in the DF, which decreases the light use efficiency. As a net effect, rice yields were estimated to significantly increase by 0.8%–2.6% with aerosol concentrations reductions from 20 to 100%, which is lower than the estimates obtained in earlier studies that only considered the effects of RAD. This finding suggests that both RAD and DF are important processes influencing rice yields and should be incorporated into future assessments of agricultural responses to variations in aerosol-induced radiation under climate change.

		Shi, W. J.	High day- and night-time temperatures affect grain growth dynamics in contrasting rice genotypes		Journal of Experimental Botany 	2017	volume 68, no. 18; pages 5233-5245, ill. Ref.	Rice grain yield and quality are predicted to be highly vulnerable to global warming. Five genotypes including heat-tolerant and susceptible checks, a heat-tolerant near-isogenic line and two hybrids were exposed to control (31 °C/23 °C, day/night), high night-time temperature (HNT; 31 °C/30 °C), high day-time temperature (HDT; 38 °C/23 °C) and high day- and night-time temperature (HNDT; 38 °C/30 °C) treatments for 20 consecutive days during the grain-filling stage. Grain-filling dynamics, starch metabolism enzymes, temporal starch accumulation patterns and the process of chalk formation were quantified. Compensation between the rate and duration of grain filling minimized the impact of HNT, but irreversible impacts on seed-set, grain filling and ultimately grain weight were recorded with HDT and HNDT. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated irregular and smaller starch granule formation affecting amyloplast build-up with HDT and HNDT, while a quicker but normal amylopast build-up was recorded with HNT. Our findings revealed temporal variation in the starch metabolism enzymes in all three stress treatments. Changes in the enzymatic activity did not derail starch accumulation under HNT when assimilates were sufficiently available, while both sucrose supply and the conversion of sucrose into starch were affected by HDT and HNDT. The findings indicate differential mechanisms leading to high day and high night temperature stress-induced loss in yield and quality. Additional genetic improvement is needed to sustain rice productivity and quality under future climates.	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)		Rice thesaurus	Yin, X. Y. ;Struik, P.

		Catolos, M. 	Genetic loci governing grain yield and root development under variable rice cultivation conditions		Frontiers in Plant Science 	2017	volume 8, no. 1763; 17 pages, ill. Ref.	Drought is the major abiotic stress to rice grain yield under unpredictable changing climatic scenarios. The widely grown, high yielding but drought susceptible rice varieties need to be improved by unraveling the genomic regions controlling traits enhancing drought tolerance. The present study was conducted with the aim to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for grain yield and root development traits under irrigated non-stress and reproductive-stage drought stress in both lowland and upland situations. A mapping population consisting of 480 lines derived from a cross between Dular (drought-tolerant) and IR64-21 (drought susceptible) was used. QTL analysis revealed three major consistent-effect QTLs for grain yield (qDTY1.1, qDTY1.3, and qDTY8.1) under non-stress and reproductive-stage drought stress conditions, and 2 QTLs for root traits (qRT9.1 for root-growth angle and qRT5.1 for multiple root traits, i.e., seedling-stage root length, root dry weight and crown root number). The genetic locus qDTY1.1 was identified as hotspot for grain yield and yield-related agronomic and root traits. The study identified significant positive correlations among numbers of crown roots and mesocotyl length at the seedling stage and root length and root dry weight at depth at later stages with grain yield and yield-related traits. Under reproductive stage drought stress, the grain yield advantage of the lines with QTLs ranged from 24.1 to 108.9% under upland and 3.0–22.7% under lowland conditions over the lines without QTLs. The lines with QTL combinations qDTY1.3+qDTY8.1 showed the highest mean grain yield advantage followed by lines having qDTY1.1+qDTY8.1 and qDTY1.1+qDTY8.1+qDTY1.3, across upland/lowland reproductive-stage drought stress. The identified QTLs for root traits, mesocotyl length, grain yield and yield-related traits can be immediately deployed in marker-assisted breeding to develop drought tolerant high yielding rice varieties.

		Sarao, P. S.	Advances in breeding for resistance to hoppers in rice	Springer, Singapore	In: Breeding insect resistant crops for sustainable agriculture 	2017	pages 101-130, ill. Ref.	Rice productivity is hampered by a number of diseases and insects. Among the insects, hoppers including planthoppers and leafhoppers are typical phloem-sap feeders, which are very serious and damaging insect pests of rice in Asia. Many chemicals have been recommended for the control of planthoppers, but due to their feeding habit at the base of the plant, the farmers are unable to notice and effectively control these pests. Exploiting host plant resistance to hoppers and incorporating resistant genes in commercial cultivars are an alternative, economical and environment-friendly approach. To date, approximately 70 resistance genes against hoppers have been identified, and most of these genes have been tagged with molecular markers. Recently six genes for resistance to brown planthopper (BPH) in different lines have been cloned using map-based cloning. Based on molecular analysis of cloned genes, it appears that there is considerable similarity in the plant response to BPH infestation and fungal/bacterial pathogen attack. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) and pyramiding of genes for resistance to BPH and green rice leafhopper (GRH) have shown higher level and wide spectrum of resistance than their monogenic lines. In addition, transgenic approaches including RNAi have targeted various plant lectins and volatile compounds to generate resistance to hoppers. In context of changing climate, the major challenge for plant breeders is to breed varieties while taking care of changing populations of planthoppers and biotype development. Future research priorities should concentrate on high-throughput screening of germplasm for field resistance to planthoppers, identifying and transferring new genes for resistance from different sources to broaden the gene pool of rice and identifying durable combination of genes for marker-assisted pyramiding.

		Hasegawa, T.	Causes of variation among rice models in yield response to CO2 examined with free-air CO2 enrichment and growth chamber experiments		Scientific Reports  	2017	volume 7, no. 14858; 1-13 pages, ill. Ref.	The CO2 fertilization effect is a major source of uncertainty in crop models for future yield forecasts, but coordinated efforts to determine the mechanisms of this uncertainty have been lacking. Here, we studied causes of uncertainty among 16 crop models in predicting rice yield in response to elevated [CO2] (E-[CO2]) by comparison to free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) and chamber experiments. The model ensemble reproduced the experimental results well. However, yield prediction in response to E-[CO2] varied significantly among the rice models. The variation was not random: models that overestimated at one experiment simulated greater yield enhancements at the others. The variation was not associated with model structure or magnitude of photosynthetic response to E-[CO2] but was significantly associated with the predictions of leaf area. This suggests that modelled secondary effects of E-[CO2] on morphological development, primarily leaf area, are the sources of model uncertainty. Rice morphological development is conservative to carbon acquisition. Uncertainty will be reduced by incorporating this conservative nature of the morphological response to E-[CO2] into the models. Nitrogen levels, particularly under limited situations, make the prediction more uncertain. Improving models to account for [CO2] × N interactions is necessary to better evaluate management practices under climate change.

		Panda, A.	Vulnerability to climate variability and drought among small and marginal farmers: a case study in Odisha, India		Climate and Development  	2017	volume 9, no. 7; pages 605-617, ill. Ref.	Indicator-based frameworks have been widely used in vulnerability analysis to understand vulnerability to climate variability and change. This study examines the socio-economic vulnerability of farmers exposed to drought conditions and climate variability in one of the highly vulnerable state (Odisha) in Eastern India. Intensive survey was undertaken among 183 households in four villages to collect data on various socio-economic and livelihood indicators. Data were aggregated using a composite index, and vulnerability in four villages was compared. Our assessment shows that caution is warranted in terms of the assumption that we make about adaptive capacity. A higher adaptive capacity of the communities in vulnerability index does not necessarily imply that they are less vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and change and vice versa. Highly vulnerable villages to climate risks are also the ones involved in various adaptation actions in agriculture. The findings further suggests that although vulnerability indices are helpful in identifying vulnerable people and places, there is a need to examine multiple stressors that interacts with socio-economic and biophysical vulnerability of communities. Results shows that highly vulnerable villages are characterized by features such as high levels of poverty, high levels of borrowing, less crop diversity, with agriculture as the only source of income and low level of agricultural insurance. Finally, results demonstrate the importance of diversified livelihoods in managing risks associated with climate hazards.

		Cohen, S. P.	RNA-Seq analysis reveals insight into enhanced rice Xa7-mediated bacterial blight resistance at high temperature		PLoS ONE 	2017	volume 12, no. 11; e0187625 (19 pages), ill. Ref.	Plant disease is a major challenge to agriculture worldwide, and it is exacerbated by abiotic environmental factors. During some plant-pathogen interactions, heat stress allows pathogens to overcome host resistance, a phenomenon which could severely impact crop productivity considering the global warming trends associated with climate change. Despite the importance of this phenomenon, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. To better understand host plant responses during simultaneous heat and pathogen stress, we conducted a transcriptomics experiment for rice plants (cultivar IRBB61) containing Xa7, a bacterial blight disease resistance (R) gene, that were infected with Xanthomonas oryzae, the bacterial blight pathogen of rice, during high temperature stress. Xa7-mediated resistance is unusual relative to resistance mediated by other R genes in that it functions better at high temperatures. Using RNA-Seq technology, we identified 8,499 differentially expressed genes as temperature responsive in rice cultivar IRBB61 experiencing susceptible and resistant interactions across three time points. Notably, genes in the plant hormone abscisic acid biosynthesis and response pathways were up-regulated by high temperature in both mock-treated plants and plants experiencing a susceptible interaction and were suppressed by high temperature in plants exhibiting Xa7-mediated resistance. Genes responsive to salicylic acid, an important plant hormone for disease resistance, were down-regulated by high temperature during both the susceptible and resistant interactions, suggesting that enhanced Xa7-mediated resistance at high temperature is not dependent on salicylic acid signaling. A DNA sequence motif similar to known abscisic acid-responsive cis-regulatory elements was identified in the promoter region upstream of genes up-regulated in susceptible but down-regulated in resistant interactions. The results of our study suggest that the plant hormone abscisic acid is an important node for cross-talk between plant transcriptional response pathways to high temperature stress and pathogen attack. Genes in this pathway represent an important focus for future study to determine how plants evolved to deal with simultaneous abiotic and biotic stresses.

		Amani, K.	Rainfed rice management adaptation to the increased climate variability in Côte d'Ivoire: application of ORYZA (v3) model to the bimodal areas of San-Pedro and Dimbokro		International Journal of Innovation and Applied Studies 	2017	volume 20, no. 3; 792-803, ill. Ref.	The increasing rainfall variability in West Africa is a great challenge for crop productivity in small-scale farming systems, thus jeopardizing food security. Rainfed rice is particularly sensitive to inconsistent rainfall, especially during the reproductive stage. It is, therefore, necessary to develop management practices suited to the change of rainfall pattern over the growth seasons. In this study, the modeling technology with the rice model ORYZA (v3) was used to identify appropriate rainfed rice growing seasons for a better adaptation of farmers to climate variability. The potential yields, the favorable sowing periods, the optimum sowing dates, and the attainable yields of two contrasted cultivars were determined. After successfully calibrating and validating the model, it predicted potential yields of 5.5 to 6.5 tons/ha for the early maturing variety WAB56-104 (90-100 days), while potential yields of 4 to and 5.5 tons/ha was predicted for the late maturing variety CG14 (115-125 days). In rainfed conditions, two favorable sowing periods were identified from the model scenario analysis. The first period spans from late February to late April and the second from late July to early September. Farmers can double their actual yield of 1.5 tons/ha if they follow the recommended sowing dates and good agricultural practices. Indeed, the yield of 3.5 tons/ha was found with the variety WAB 56-104 sown on around 16 April in San-Pedro and around 2 April in Dimbokro. The yield of 3 tons/ha for the variety CG14 could be achieved if the sowing is done on around 18 March in San-Pedro and around 21 March in Dimbokro.

Sustainable rice production for feeding increasing population is a primary global challenge for food security. Frequent dry spell, erratic rainfall and expanding salinity are further aggravating this problem. Recently, with the use of modern molecular techniques, stress tolerant rice varieties (STRVs) have been developed at International Rice Research Institute and released in India, Bangladesh, and Nepal in collaboration with National Agricultural Research and Extension System (NARES) partners, and made available to the farmers for cultivation. Studies have suggested that these newly available STRVs possess remarkably higher grain yield potentials than their recurrent parents in rainfed stress-prone environment. Yield potential of these varieties can be further enhanced up to 11 ha-1 by using smart agronomic interventions. The resilience of rice production systems can be increased by proper dissemination of STRVs in the target areas. This review addresses possible adaptation and mitigation strategies for making rice production sustainable and more climate-smart, based on cost-effective management options and production systems in the context of progressively changing climate.

		Ishimaru, T.	Breeding efforts to mitigate damage by heat stress to spikelet sterility and grain quality		Plant Production Science	2016	volume 19, no. 1, pages 12-21, ill. Ref.	Global warming is predicted to aggravate the risk of unstable crop production. It is of great concern that damage to rice spikelet sterility and grain quality will increase, resulting in yield and economic losses. To secure the global food supply and farmers’ income, the development of rice cultivars with heat resilience is a pressing concern. Regarding spikelet sterility, rice cultivars with heat tolerance at different growth stages have been identified in recent years. The early-morning flowering (EMF) trait is effective in heat escape because it shifts the time of day of flowering to earlier in the morning when it is cooler. Although varietal differences are very small, there are some genetic resources for EMF in wild rice accessions. Regarding heat-induced grain chalkiness, heat-tolerant japonica cultivars for mitigating white-back type of chalky grains (WBCG) were found. Quantitative trait loci for heat tolerance at flowering, EMF, and for WBCG in grain quality have been mapped on the rice chromosomes. Further genetic efforts have been successfully connected to the development of near-isogenic lines for each trait with tagged molecular markers. These breeding materials are quite unique and useful in facilitating marker-assisted breeding toward the development of heat-resilient rice in terms of spikelet sterility and grain quality	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)	Plant breeding;Heat;Heat stress;Heat tolerance;Grain quality;Climatic factors;Climatic change;Grain quality	Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus	Hirabayashi, H.;Sasaki, K.;Ye, C.

		Gonzaga, Z. J. C.	Mapping additional QTLs from FR13A to increase submergence tolerance in rice beyond SUB1		Euphytica  	2016	volume 209; pages 627-636, ill. Ref.	Submergence is a common naturally occurring disaster in rice production in South and Southeast Asia. The development of mega-varieties with tolerance conferred by the SUB1 gene on chromosome 9 derived from FR13A that can withstand up to 2 weeks of complete submergence has been one of the best solutions. However, the recent severe conditions of flooding because of climate change, which has been predicted to become worse in the near future, calls for the development of an improved variety with superior tolerance of submergence. To search for novel quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that can complement the SUB1 gene, recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from an IR42/FR13A mapping population were explored. Five QTLs were detected on chromosomes 1, 4, 8, 9, and 10, four of which were from FR13A and one was from IR42. The study confirms the SUB1 QTL on chromosome 9 with a maximum LOD score of 19.51 and R2 of 53.60 %. Additional novel QTLs coming from FR13A on chromosomes 1, 8, and 10 were identified with LOD scores of 5.16, 3.56, and 3.85 and R2 of 23.33, 14.98, and 15.80 %, respectively. Interestingly, lines without SUB1 were still tolerant, with a maximum survival rate up to 95 % because of the presence of these additional QTLs. The non-SUB1 QTLs identified have great potential to enhance tolerance as evidenced by the superior tolerance of FR13A compared with that of the developed Sub1 lines. By transferring selected potential QTLs that are mostly additive to SUB1, it is hoped that crop damage from severe flooding can be significantly decreased	English	Also available in electronic format (PDF)	Chromosome mapping;Climatic change;Climatic factors;Production;Quantitative trait loci;Submergence;Submergence tolerance;Varieties	Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus;Rice thesaurus	Carandang, J.;Sanchez, D.

		Haefele, S. M.	Climate ready rice: Augmenting drought tolerance with best management practices		Field Crops Research	2016	(e-first): 10 pages, ill. Ref.	Drought stress is one of the most important limitations for rice production in rainfed lowland systems. This is the case in rainfed systems now, and will probably even be more important in the near future given the changing climate. Recent advances in rice breeding provide much improved drought tolerance in modern rice cultivars as has already been shown in farmers’ fields. To accompany these new cultivars, complementary crop management practices and diversified production systems have an important role to help farmers minimize risks and raise productivity and profitability. To evaluate the options we reviewed a wide range of studies investigating management options for rainfed lowland rice with a specific focus on drought-prone environments. To introduce the environment we provide an overview of general characteristics with a more detailed analysis of soil quality in rice-based rainfed lowlands around the world. Reviewed management technologies to mitigate drought stress include water management options, the choice of appropriate germplasm, adjusted cropping systems, improved nutrient management, different crop establishment options, better field management and soil amelioration. Several of these technologies do offer important advantages but their usefulness and applicability is dependent on site and system characteristics. Thus, a combination of germplasm × environment × management is necessary to choose the best management for a given rainfed lowland system. Getting this right can transform rice-based systems in rainfed lowlands, make them more productive, and increase and stabilize farmers’ income.

To address the multiple challenges to food security posed by global climate change, population growth and rising incomes, plant breeders are developing new crop varieties that can enhance both agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability. Current breeding practices, however, are unable to keep pace with demand. Genomic selection (GS) is a new technique that helps accelerate the rate of genetic gain in breeding by using whole-genome data to predict the breeding value of offspring. Here, we describe a new GS model that combines RR-BLUP with markers fit as fixed effects selected from the results of a genome-wide-association study (GWAS) on the RR-BLUP training data. We term this model GS + de novo GWAS. In a breeding population of tropical rice, GS + de novo GWAS outperformed six other models for a variety of traits and in multiple environments. On the basis of these results, we propose an extended, two-part breeding design that can be used to efficiently integrate novel variation into elite breeding populations, thus expanding genetic diversity and enhancing the potential for sustainable productivity gains.

		Dossa, G. S.	High temperature enhances the resistance of cultivated African Rice, Oryza glaberrima, to bacterial blight		Plant Disease	2016	volume 100, no. 2; pages 380-387, ill. Ref.	Rice bacterial blight (BB) is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and is responsible for substantial yield loss worldwide. Host resistance remains the most feasible control measure. However, pathogen variability leads to the failure of certain resistance genes to control the disease, and climate change with high amplitudes of heat predisposes the host plant to pathogen invasion. Due to pressure in natural selection, landrace species often carry a wide range of unique traits conferring tolerance of stress. Therefore, exploring their genetic background for host resistance could enable the identification of broad-spectrum resistance to combined abiotic and biotic stresses. Nineteen Oryza glaberrima accessions and O. sativa rice variety SUPA were evaluated for BB resistance under high temperature (35 and 31°C day and night, respectively) using 14 X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains originated from the Philippines. Under normal temperature, most of the accessions showed resistance to 9 strains (64.3%) and accession TOG6007 showed broad-spectrum resistance to 12 strains (85.7%). Under high temperature, most accessions showed a reduction in BB disease, whereas, accession TOG5620 showed disease reduction from all the X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains under high temperature. Molecular characterization using gene-based and linked markers for BB resistance genes Xa4, xa5, Xa7, xa13, and Xa21 revealed the susceptible alleles of Xa4, xa5, xa13, and Xa21 in O. glaberrima. However, no allele of Xa7 was detected among O. glaberrima accessions. Our results suggest that O. glaberrima accessions contain a BB resistance different from the Xa gene type.

Driven by policies around food security, market impacts on crop production, and trade regulations, these changes will define crop production systems into the future, impacting rice biodiversity and ecosystem function and giving rise to new pest and disease scenarios.

Recent advances in environmentally friendly agriculture, including ecological engineering, are central to the sustainability and resilience of rice ecosystems; but require support from policy to ensure their best effects. This paper introduces some recent advances in the methods of ecological engineering based on research conducted in the Philippines.

		Kraus, D.	How well can we assess impacts of agricultural land management changes on the total greenhouse gas balance (CO2, CH4 and N2O) of tropical rice-cropping systems with a biogeochemical model?		Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment	2016	volume 224; pages 104-115, ill. Ref.	Paddy rice is the main cropping system in Southeast Asia. However, water scarcity arising from competition from other sectors, rainfall variability and climate change increasingly challenges global rice production. One option to adapt to lower water availability is switching from paddy rice to less irrigation intensive upland cropping systems. Such land management change (LMC) is likely to significantly affect ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling and its greenhouse gas (GHG) balance. This study evaluates how well the ecosystem model LandscapeDNDC is able to simulate observed emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from different tropical cropping rotations, i.e., double- and triple-cropped paddy rice, aerobic rice–paddy rice and maize–paddy rice (rice: O. sativa, maize: Zea mays) and how management changes to rice dominated lowland systems will affect the GHG balance on short (a few years) and long (several decades) time scales.

		Zhang, T.	Model biases in rice phenology under warmer climates		Scientific Reports	2016	volume 6 no. 27355, pages 1-9, ill. Ref.	Climate-induced crop yields model projections are constrained by the accuracy of the phenology simulation in crop models. Here, we use phenology observations from 775 trials with 19 rice cultivars in 5 Asian countries to compare the performance of four rice phenology models (growing-degree-day (GDD), exponential, beta and bilinear models) when applied to warmer climates. For a given cultivar, the difference in growing season temperature (GST) varied between 2.2 and 8.2 °C in different trials, which allowed us to calibrate the models for lower GST and validate under higher GST, with three calibration experiments. The results show that in warmer climates the bilinear and beta phenology models resulted in gradually increasing bias for phenology predication and double yield bias per percent increase in phenology simulation bias, while the GDD and exponential models maintained a comparatively constant bias. The phenology biases were primarily attributed to varying phenological patterns to temperature in models, rather than on the size of the calibration dataset. Additionally, results suggest that model simulations based on multiple cultivars provide better predictability than using one cultivar. Therefore, to accurately capture climate change impacts on rice phenology, we recommend simulations based on multiple cultivars using the GDD and exponential phenology models.

		Jagadish, K.	Implications of high temperature and elevated CO2 on flowering time in plants		Frontiers in Plant Science	2016	(provisional pdf copy); 31 pages, ill. Ref.	Flowering is a crucial determinant for plant reproductive success and seed-set. Increasing temperature and elevated carbon-dioxide (e[CO2]) are key factors of climate change factors that could affect plant fitness and flowering related events. Addressing the effect of these environmental factors on flowering events such as time of day of anthesis (TOA) and flowering time (duration from germination till flowering) is critical to understand the adaptation of plants/crops to changing climateenvironment and hence is the major aim of this review. Increasing ambient temperature is the major climatic factor that advances flowering time in crops and other plants, with a modest effect of e[CO2]. Integrated environmental stimuli such as photoperiod, temperature and e[CO2] regulating flowering time is discussed. The critical role of plant tissue temperature influencing TOA is highlighted and the need for crop models need to substitute ambient air temperature with canopy or floral tissue temperature to improve predictionsis recommended. Increasing ambient temperature is the major climatic factor that advances flowering time in crops and other plants, with a modest effect of e[CO2]. Integrated environmental stimuli such as photoperiod, temperature and e[CO2] regulating flowering time is discussed. A complex signaling network of flowering regulation with change in ambient temperature involving different transcription factors (PIF4, PIF5), flowering suppressors (HvODDSOC2, SVP, FLC) and autonomous pathway (FCA, FVE) genes, mainly from Arabidopsis Arabidopsis, provides a promising avenue tolead in improve our understandinging of the dynamics of flowering time under changing climate. Conversely, e[CO2]-Elevated CO2 mediated changes in tissue sugar status and a direct [CO2]-driven regulatory pathway involving a key flowering gene, MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (MFT), are emerging evidence for the role of e[CO2] in flowering time regulation.

		Dossa, G. S.	Rice response to simultaneous bacterial blight and drought stress during compatible and incompatible interactions		European Journal of Plant Pathology 	2016	volume 147; pages 115-127, ill. Ref.	Plant response to one type of stress can be affected by simultaneous exposure to a second stress, for example when abiotic and biotic stresses occur together. Ten rice genotypes comprising those with bacterial blight (BB) resistance (R) genes, drought quantitative trait loci (QTLs) plus a BB R gene, and BB susceptible genotypes, were subjected to mild and moderate drought stress and plants were inoculated with two Xoo strains (PXO99 and PXO145) to simulate the challenges rice crops face under simultaneous stress of drought and BB. Plant height and dry shoot biomass were significantly reduced by drought stress treatments. The BB disease lesion lengths varied according to rice genotypes and PXO99 Xoo multiplication and spread in planta was higher compared to that of PXO145, which generally decreased under mild drought stress. Rice genotype IRBB7 (Xa7) showed less Xoo spread and a reduced Xoo multiplication under drought stress compared to the well-watered control with PXO145. In contrast, in genotypes with a different BB R gene and/or drought QTLs [IRBB4 (Xa4), IR87705–6-9-B (Xa4 + qDYT  2.2 ), IR87707–445-B-B-B (Xa4 + qDYT  2.2  + qDYT  4.1 ) and IR87707–446-B-B-B (Xa4 + qDYT  2.2  + qDYT  4.1 )], Xoo multiplication and spread in planta was higher with drought stress. This study has shown that drought stress affected rice response to the BB pathogen and the response varied according to the rice genotype. It is concluded that evaluating rice varieties under combined abiotic and biotic stresses will be the best strategy to determine biotic stress resistance durability under climate change.

More than 100 countries pledged to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the 2015 Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

		Panda, A.	Exploring climate change perceptions, rainfall trends  and perceived barriers to adaptation in a drought  affected region in India		Natural Hazards	2016	volume 84; pages 777-796, ill. Ref.	Climate change poses major challenges to agricultural systems in drought prone regions of the world especially in the areas with high poverty, lack of irrigation facilities and low productivity. Towards this it is essential to understand the climate change perceptions, adaptation practices and barriers to effective adaptation at household and community level. This paper using household surveys and focus group discussions in one of the drought prone areas of Odisha in India, explores various aspects of perception on climate change and barriers to adaptation. It also analyses the accuracy of perceptions based on rainfall data from nearest meteorological stations. The study reinforces the argument by earlier studies that the perception by people simply cannot be wrong because they may have a just a low correlation with underlying meteorological data. Results suggest that farmers increasingly perceive the changes in the rainfall and temperature patterns. However, when compared with the trend in actual rainfall data, perceptions on rainfall are found to more closely align with the results from the nearest station as compared to the station farther from it. Analysis revealed that seasonal rainfall variability has a profound influence on the farmers’ perceptions on climate change and drought in the study region. Farmers’ are still dependent on the traditional forecasting system because of the lack of access to modern climate forecasting and tailored information for agricultural practice. Although farmers in the study region are already adapting to the changing climate, the study finds that while lack of access to water and irrigation, information on climate change adaptation and early warning systems are major barriers to adaptation at the household level lack of government intervention, lack of knowledge on drought resistant crops and varieties and lack of renovation of water bodies and irrigation were mentioned as the major barriers at the community level. Findings from the paper argue for better adaptation planning at the local level incorporating local level perceptions and barriers to adaptation. In such areas local level planning can be crucial in enhancing the adaptive capacity of the farmers.

		Lampayan, R. M.	Farmer-participatory evaluation of the wetting and drying (AWD) water saving technology n Southern Laos		The Lao Journal of Agriculture and Forestry, Papers submitted by CSE/2009/004/ Southern Laos Project	2014	pages 121-135, ill. Ref.	Traditional lowland rice production in Asia requires much water and consumes more than 50% of all irrigation water. In Lao PDR, like other rice producing countries in Asia, water resources are becoming increasingly scarce due to effect of climate change and increasing competition on the use of water between sectors. Consequently, there is a need to develop alternative rice production systems that require less water and increase the water productivity. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation in rice is a mature technology that decreases water use by 15 – 30% without reducing yields. AWD has been widely adopted in China and is becoming a recommended practice in water-scarce irrigated areas in South and Southeast Asia. In Lao PDR, AWD methodologies were introduced 2011 and 2012 at demonstration sites in the south of the country: Champone District in Savannakhet Province and Soukhuma District in Champassak Province. This paper discusses the results of the AWD demonstration trials of irrigated dry season rice production and attempts to determine farmers’ perceptions of AWD as an effective water-saving technology. Results indicated that yields between AWD trial plots and neighbouring farmers’ fields were similar, while water input was 19 – 25% lower than that of farmers fields. The positive results of the AWD trials (both physical benefits of using less water with the same yield and positive perception by the farmers) through farmer- participatory development and extension activities employed in this study to demonstrate the benefits of AWD can be translated into a blueprint to guide dissemination activities of AWD in lowland irrigated areas in the country. However, the speed and extent of adoption may depend very much on the long-term commitments of the country’s extension systems, including DAFO and PAFO offices.

		Wang, D. P.	Temperature explains the yield difference of double-season rice between tropical and subtropical environments		Field Crops Research 	2016	(e-first copy): 9 pages, ill. Ref.	Crop yields are largely influenced by air temperature and solar radiation, but the individual effects of these weather variables are difficult to distinguish because they are often not independent. Here, we demonstrate a large effect of temperature on rice grain yield when solar radiation and crop growth duration were not confounding factors for explaining yield difference across two locations in the tropical and subtropical environments. We found that grain yield of double-season rice crops in the subtropical environment of Wuxue County, Hubei Province, China was 9–66% higher than that in the tropical environment of International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines. Such yield difference was not caused by the difference in crop growth duration from transplanting to maturity. Biomass production rather than harvest index was responsible for the yield difference. Average daily minimum and maximum temperature from transplanting to maturity at IRRI was 3.4 and 1.9 °C higher than that at Wuxue, respectively, whereas average daily solar radiation at Wuxue was lower or similar to that at IRRI. Crop’s efficiency in converting solar radiation into biomass (i.e. radiation use efficiency, RUE) at Wuxue was 48% higher than that at IRRI, which was associated with the difference in temperature between the two environments. We concluded that lower rice yield in the tropical environment was associated with lower RUE, which was due to the higher temperature compared with the subtropical environment. Our results suggested the crop adaptation strategies for global climate changes should focus more on future warming.	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)		Rice thesaurus	Laza, M. R.

		Nhan, P. P.	Increasing profitability and water use efficiency of triple rice crop production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam		The Journal of Agricultural Science 	2016	volume 154, no. 06; pages 1015-1025, ill. Ref.	Rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam is threatened by future water scarcity caused by changing rainfall patterns and increasing irrigation costs. To improve resilience of the triple rice farming system to future climate-related stresses, profitability needs to be increased through water use efficiency, fertilizer management and planting methods. During four cropping seasons in 2011–13, alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation was applied in the triple rice production area within An Giang Province, Vietnam. An issue with the application of AWD is the prevalence of acid sulphate soils in the Mekong Delta. Three types of irrigation management were tested; continuously flooded (CF) where the water in the paddy was maintained at 5 cm; AWD where the water level was allowed to fall to 15 cm below the ground surface, at which point the field was irrigated until the water level was at 1 cm above the ground surface (designated −15 cm); AWD where the water level was allowed to fall to 30 cm below the ground surface before irrigation until the water level was at 1 cm above the ground surface (designated −30 cm). Two further experiments were also undertaken which examined the planting method (transplant v. direct sowing) and phosphorus rate on rice yield. There was no effect on yield caused by P fertilizer rate and irrigation management in any year, and there was no significant effect on soil pH or salinity caused by irrigation management. Overall net profitability was greatest for the AWD treatments because of the reduction in pumping and labour costs in the dry season. Transplanted rice improved yields, but the labour cost reduced overall profitability. The study shows that AWD (−15 cm) can be safely applied in acid sulphate soil areas within the triple rice areas of An Giang Mekong Delta and saved at least 0·27 of total irrigated water quantity used during three of the six cropping seasons. The increased profitability of the AWD rice production system will help to improve the resilience of triple rice cropping systems to future water scarcity.Rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam is threatened by future water scarcity caused by changing rainfall patterns and increasing irrigation costs.

		Dossa, G. S.	Combining drought QTLs and bacterial blight Xa-genes to control bacterial blight disease under drought stress		Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment 	2016	volume 233; pages 282-290, ill. Ref.	Crops under climate change will be simultaneously exposed to multiple stresses of biotic and abiotic nature. To control rice bacterial blight (BB), near-isogenic lines carrying Xa genes were previously developed, while rice near isogenic lines (NILs) with drought yield QTLs (qDTY) were selected for rice yield improvement under drought conditions. In this study, the response of 17 rice lines to simultaneous BB and drought stresses were evaluated in screenhouse trials and field trials to evaluate their response to exposure to BB and drought simultaneously. Under drought stress, qDTY NILs with their shorter growing period were less affected, while IR24 and IRBB4 showed growth reduction and inhibition of flowering under field conditions. NILs with BB resistance (R) Xa gene alone showed resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) strains carrying the corresponding avirulence gene, except in genotype IRBB4 with the Xa4 R gene that, although resistant, showed a significant increase in disease severity under drought stress after inoculation with Xoo strain PXO61 (avrXa4) compared to irrigated conditions. IR64 introgression lines (IR87705-6-9-B, IR87707-445-B-B-B, IR87707-446-B-B-B) with the combination of the Xa4 R gene and qDTY showed resistance to Xoo strains PXO61 (avrXa4) and PXO145 (avrXa4) under irrigated conditions but were less resistant under drought. Vandana qDTY NILs were susceptible to all Xoo strains under both irrigated and drought stress conditions, but were more resistant under drought. These results highlight the wide genotypic variation among rice lines in response to BB under drought stress and the advantage of trait combinations (Xa + qDTY) to confer drought tolerance and BB resistance under unfavorable future climate conditions.

		Zhao, C.	Plausible rice yield losses under future climate warming		Nature Plants	2016	volume 3, no. 16202; 5 pages, ill. Ref.	Rice is the staple food for more than 50% of the world's population1,​2,​3. Reliable prediction of changes in rice yield is thus central for maintaining global food security. This is an extraordinary challenge. Here, we compare the sensitivity of rice yield to temperature increase derived from field warming experiments and three modelling approaches: statistical models, local crop models and global gridded crop models. Field warming experiments produce a substantial rice yield loss under warming, with an average temperature sensitivity of −5.2 ± 1.4% K−1. Local crop models give a similar sensitivity (−6.3 ± 0.4% K−1), but statistical and global gridded crop models both suggest less negative impacts of warming on yields (−0.8 ± 0.3% and −2.4 ± 3.7% K−1, respectively). Using data from field warming experiments, we further propose a conditional probability approach to constrain the large range of global gridded crop model results for the future yield changes in response to warming by the end of the century (from −1.3% to −9.3% K−1). The constraint implies a more negative response to warming (−8.3 ± 1.4% K−1) and reduces the spread of the model ensemble by 33%. This yield reduction exceeds that estimated by the International Food Policy Research Institute assessment (−4.2 to −6.4% K−1) (ref. 4). Our study suggests that without CO2 fertilization, effective adaptation and genetic improvement, severe rice yield losses are plausible under intensive climate warming scenarios.

	1522-2624	Weller, S.	Diurnal patterns of methane emissions from paddy rice fields in the Philippines		Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science	2015	volume 178; pages 755-767, ill. Ref.	Methane (CH4) emissions from rice paddies often show significant diurnal variations, most likely driven by diurnal changes of radiation and temperature in air, floodwater, and soil. Field measurements, however, are often scheduled at a fixed time of a given measuring day, thereby neglecting sub-daily variations of CH4 emissions. Here we evaluated diurnal patterns of CH4 emissions from traditional paddy rice production as observed during field measurements in the Philippines. Field emissions were measured during three consecutive cropping seasons using an automated chamber and gas sampling system with fluxes being obtained every 4 h. Methane fluxes were monitored with a total of nine chambers during the dry seasons in 2012 and 2013 and 27 chambers during the wet season in 2012. Significant and consistent diurnal patterns of CH4 emissions were mainly observed from the start of field flooding until the middle of cropping periods, i.e., periods with low leaf area of the rice crop. Our data show that disregarding the diurnal variability of fluxes results in an average overestimation of seasonal CH4 emissions of 22% (16–31%) if measurements were conducted only around noon. Scheduling manual sampling either at early morning (7:00–9:00) or evening (17:00–19:00) results in estimations of seasonal emissions within 94–101% of the “true” value as calculated from multiple daily flux measurements. Alternatively, uncertainties of seasonal emissions can be reduced to an average of ≤3% by applying sinus function or Gauss function-based correction factors.

Coastal areas are severely affected by Cclimate change, natural disasters (such as storms and floods) and abiotic stresses (drought and salinity in particular). The negative impact of climate change on rice production has become such a major concern that farmers repeatedly affected by natural calamities are losing interest in cultivating the crop. The situation is a critical threat for Bangladesh, particularly its food security. Yet, the level of awareness of climate change is relatively low across the country. At the same time, the national economy depends heavily on agriculture and natural resources, which are vulnerable to climate change and sea-level rise.

	14391791	Klotzbucher, T.	Plant-available silicon in paddy soils as a key factor for sustainable rice production in Southeast Asia		Basic and Applied Ecology	2014	volume 16; pages 665-673, ill. Ref.	Rice is among the most important crops for human nutrition. The need to increase yields is commonly achieved by agricultural intensification that often comes along with negative impacts on the environment. In 2011, the interdisciplinary LEGATO project was launched with the aim to advance sustainable rice production. A key feature for sustainable rice production is silicon (Si) availability. Si can e.g. improve rice crop resistance against pathogens and prevent the uptake of toxic metals. Herein, we introduce the characteristics of the seven LEGATO study regions in Vietnam and the Philippines (i.e., climate, geology, soils, agricultural practices) ranging from lowlands with intensive production to mountain regions with extensive and traditional production systems. Secondly, we show data on concentrations of plant-available Si (Sipa) in topsoils of paddy fields (Ap + Arp horizons) and of sites with an alternative land-use (forest, upland crops), and discuss factors determining spatial differences in Sipa concentrations. Results show that Sipa concentrations in topsoils of paddies (assessed by acetate extraction) greatly differ between Philippine (141–322 mg Si kg−1) and Vietnamese (20–51 mg Si kg−1) regions. This can be explained by differences in geo-/pedologic conditions between the countries. Large Sipa concentrations in the Philippines are due to recent rock formation by active volcanism, hence, by a large Sipa input due to mineral weathering in recent geologic history. Land-use can also affect Sipa in topsoils: in Philippine regions, Sipa concentrations were significantly larger for paddies than for other land-use types. In some of the Vietnamese paddies, Sipa concentrations are below critical values, thus might limit plant growth. Many Vietnamese farmers export Si from fields by removing straw residues with the harvest. Our subsequent research thus aims to test whether changes in harvest residue management can improve the Si supply to plants in Vietnamese regions	English	Available in electronic format (PDF).

		Le, L. H.	Application of marker assisted backcrossing to pyramid salinity tolerance (Saltol) into rice cultivar-Bac Thom 7		VNU Journal of Science: Natural Sciences and Technology 	2012	volume 28, no. 2; pages 87-99, ill. Ref.	Vietnam is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change in Asia. Rice is a principle food in Vietnam and plays an important role in economy of the country. However, rice yield and its cultivating areas are adversely affected from the threats of devastation caused by the rise of sea level. Using marker assisted backcrossing (MABC) to develop a new salt tolerance rice variety is one of the feasible methods to cope with these devastating changes. To improve rice salt tolerance in Bac Thom 7 cultivar, FL478 was used as a donor parent to introgress the saltol QTL conferring salt tolerance into Bac Thom 7. Three backcrosses were conducted to transfer positive alleles of saltol from FL478 into Bac Thom 7. The plants number IL-30 and IL-32 in BC3F1 population expected recurrent genome recovery of up to 99.2%, 100%, respectively. These selected lines that carried the saltol alleles were screened in field for their agronomic traits. All improved lines had saltol allele similar to the donor parent FL478, whereas their agronomic performances were the same as the original Bac Thom 7. We show here the success of improving rice salt tolerance by MABC and the high efficiency of selection in early generations. In the present study, MABC accelerated the development of superior qualities in the genetic background of Bac Thom 7.	English	Available in electronic format (PDF)		Rice thesaurus	Tran, K.

		Pathak, H.	Impact of resource-conserving technologies on productivity and greenhouse gas emissions in the rice-wheat system		Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology	2011	volume 1, no. 3; pages 261-277, ill. Ref.	The rice-wheat system is the main source of food and income for millions of people in South Asia. However, because of increasing pressure of biotic and abiotic stresses in response to soil degradation and changing climate, crop productivity and farmers' profits are on a downward trend. Recent efforts have attempted to develop and deliver resource-conserving technologies (RCTs) with efficient and environmentally friendly tillage/crop establishment and water use compared with the conventional practices of farmers. No tool, however, is available to evaluate the RCTs quantitatively, particularly in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental impacts. A simulation model, named InfoRCT (Information on Use of Resource-Conserving Technologies), has been developed integrating biophysical, agronomic, and socio-economic data to establish input-output relationships related to water, fertilizer, labor, and biocide uses; GHG emissions; biocide residue in soil; and N fluxes in the rice-wheat system. The model provided a comparative assessment of RCTs in yield, income, global warming potential (GWP), biocide residue index, and N loss. The assessment showed that mid-season drying and no-till systems increased income, and also reduced the GWP. The model could be used for assessing impact of crop management practices on productivity and GHG emissions in rice-wheat systems.

		Gupta, P. K.	Development of methane emission factors for Indian paddy fields and estimation of national methane budget		Chemosphere  	2009	volume 74, no. 4; pages 590-598, ill. Ref.	A state-wise assessment of methane (CH4) budget for Indian paddies, based on a decadal measurement data across India is presented for the calendar year (CY) 1994, the base year for India’s Initial National Communication (NATCOM) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), along with national trend from CY 1979 to 2006. The NATCOM CH4 emission factors (EFs) for Indian paddy cultivation areas, generally having less than 0.7% of soil organic carbon (SOC), have been estimated as 17.48 ± 4 g m−2 for irrigated continuously flooded (IR-CF), 6.95 ± 1.86 g m−2 for rain-fed drought prone (RF-DP), 19 ± 6 g m−2 for rain-fed flood prone (RF-FP) and deep-water (DW), 6.62 ± 1.89 g m−2 for irrigated intermittently flooded single aeration (IR-IF-SA) and 2.01 ± 1.49 g m−2 for IR-IF multiple aeration (MA) paddy water regimes. The state-wise study for 1994 has indicated national CH4 budget estimate of 4.09 ± 1.19 Tg y−1 and the trend from 1979 to 2006 was in the range of 3.62 ± 1 to 4.09 ± 1.19 Tg y−1. Four higher emitting or “hot spot” states (West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh) have accounted for 53.9% of total CH4 emission with RF-FP paddy water regime as the major contributor. CH4 emissions were enhanced by factors such as SOC (∼1.5 times due to increase in SOC by ∼1.8 times), paddy cultivars (∼1.5 times), age of seedlings (∼1.4 times), and seasons (∼1.8 times in Kharif or monsoon than in Rabi or winter season).

SubscriptionThe sustainability of the rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation is important to Asia's food security. Intensive cropping with no return of crop residues and other organic inputs result in the loss of soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrient supply, and is assumed to be nonsustainable. We evaluated seven treatments comprised of various combinations of green manure (GM; Sesbania cannabina L.); wheat straw (WS),farmyard manure (FYM), and urea on yields and yield trends; P and K balance; and soil fertility in a rice-wheat experiment (1988-2000) on a loamy sand in Punjab, India. Rice yields were comparable with GM + urea, WS+ GM + urea, and urea alone, but yields were reduced when FYM was supplemented with N. Except during 1 yr, integrated use of FYM and GM produced equal or higher rice yields than other GM based treatments. Wheat straw incorporation reduced average rice yields by 7% compared with WS removal. After 5 yr of continuous application, FYM and WS were at par in increasing rice yields. Organic materials applied to rice had no residual effect on wheat yields except FYM, which increased yield by about 6% compared with urea alone. Rice yield declined by 0.02 to 0.13 Mg ha-1 yr-1 but wheat yields remained unchanged. Soil C increased with the application of WS and FYM. Potassium balance was highly negative. Although the causes of yield decline are unknown, inadequate K applications and changes in the climatic parameters are possible reasons.	ENG.	Also available in electronic format (PDF).

		Wassmann, R.	Sea level rise affecting the Vietnamese Mekong Delta: Water elevation in the flood season and implications for rice production		Climatic Change	2004	Volume 66, no. 1-2; pages 89-107, ill. Ref.	In this study, we assessed the impact of sea level rise, one of the most ascertained consequences of global climate change, for water levels in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). We used a hydraulic model to compute water levels from August to November - when flooding is presently critical- under sea level rise scenarios of 20 cm (=Δ 20) and 45 cm (=Δ 45), respectively. The outputs show that the contour lines of water levels will be shifted up to 25 km (Δ 20) and 50 km (Δ 45) towards the sea due to higher sea levels. At the onset of the flood season (August), the average increment in water levels in the Delta is 14.1 cm (Δ 20) and 32.2 cm (Δ 45), respectively. At the peak of the flood season (October), high discharge from upstream attenuates the increment in water level, but average water level rise of 11.9 cm (Δ 20) and 27.4 cm (Δ 45), respectively, still imply a substantial aggravation of flooding problems in the VMD. GIS techniques were used to delineate areas with different levels of vulnerability, i.e., area with high (2.3 mio ha =60% of the VMD), medium (0.6 mio ha = 15%) and low (1 mio ha =25%) vulnerability due to sea level rise. Rice production will be affected through excessive flooding in the tidally inundated areas and longer flooding periods in the central part of the VMD. These adverse impacts could affect all three cropping seasons, Mua (main rainfed crop), Dong Xuan (Winter-Spring) and He Thu (Summer-Autumn) in the VMD unless preventive measures are taken.

Rice and wheat are the two most important cereals in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and are responsible for the food security of the region. To understand the productivity trends in the transects of the IGP: (1) the climatic potential yields of rice and wheat were simulated using a crop simulation modeling approach and (2) the long-term trends of potential and on-farm yields were compared. The potential yields of rice and wheat in the IGP ranged from 7.7 to 10.7 and 5.2 to 7.9 Mg ha-1, respectively. The upper transects of the IGP are more productive and yield decreases by 27% for rice and by 32% for wheat from transect 2 to transect 5. The rate of change in the potential yield trend of rice from 1985 to 2000 ranged from -0.12 to 0.05 Mg ha-1 per year. Negative yield trends were observed at six of the nine sites, four of which were statistically significant (P<0.05). The decrease in radiation and increase in minimum temperature were the reasons for the yield decline. The potential yield trend of wheat, however, appeared to be stable. On-farm yields of rice also showed a negative trend but for wheat the trend was mostly positive. The adverse changes in the weather parameters and declining trends of potential and on-farm yields of rice should be taken as an indication of a future problem. Regular on-farm monitoring of crops and climatic factors is urgently needed for predicting problems and allowing measures to be taken to improve productivity.	ENG.

	11610301	Matthews, R.	Modelling the impacts of climate change and methane emission reductions on rice production: a review.	Eur. J. Agron. 19(4): 573-598, ill. Ref. Aug. 2003.				Rice agriculture is not only affected by climate change, but also contributes to global warming through the release of methane into the atmosphere. In 1989, a major research project was initiated at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines to investigate relationships between climate change and rice production. A second project started in 1993 to investigate, in more detail, mitigation options that could be employed to help reduce CH4 emissions from rice cultivation. An important component of all of this work was the quantification of these interactions between climate change and rice production into simulation models, and their subsequent use to upscale field measurements to national and regional levels. The first project developed such a model to integrate existing knowledge of effects of increased levels of CO2 and temperature on rice growth, and used this to predict the impact of various climate change scenarios on rice production in SE Asia. In the second project, routines describing the dynamics of CH4 production and emission from the soil were linked to a crop simulation model to estimate the effect of different crop management scenarios on national CH4 emissions from various countries in the region. With the recent completion of the second project, it is timely to review this modelling work describing the relationships between the global environment and rice production, a task which we attempt in the present paper. The advantages and disadvantages of the modelling approaches used and other issues relating to the upscaling of field measurements to national and regional levels are discussed. Future research directions in this area are also identified	ENG.	Also available in electronic format (PDF).

Sept. 		2002		Of the methane (CH4) emitted from a rice field during the growing season, 60{90% is emitted through the rice plants. In order to assess differences among cultivars, we determined the methane transport capacity (MTC) of 18 inbred varieties and 4 hybrids at seedling, panicle initiation (PI), flowering and maturity using an automatic measuring system under greenhouse conditions. All cultivars showed a large increase in MTC from seedling to panicle initiation, but differed in MTC in the succeeding growth stages until maturity. Rice cultivars could be divided into three MTC groups: (a) four hybrids showing no change in flowering to maturity; (b) eight inbred varieties (Zhong yu 906, Zhong zuo 93, Pusa Basmati 1, PR 111, CSR 13, Cisadane, Dodokan, IR72 and IR65598 (new plant type, NPT)) showing either no or minor changes in MTC from panicle initiation to flowering; and (c) nine other inbred varieties (Zhong hua 15, PR 108, Pusa 169, Membarano, Basmati 370, KDML 105, CSR 10, Dular and HTA 60) showing significant increase from panicle initiation to flowering. Groups (b) and (c) had large decreases in MTC at maturity. Differences in MTC patterns among groups were attributed to growth parameters (root, shoot, and root+shoot biomass without grains, and tiller numbers) and the development of morphological characteristics of the aerenchyma. The results suggest that in inbred cultivars representing tall, dwarf and NPT groups, an increase in root or aboveground biomass during plant growth until flowering determines the corresponding increase in MTC. Further increase or any change in plant biomass at maturity does not affect MTC. However, in the case of hybrids, a positive relationship of MTC with root, shoot and total plant biomass including grain indicate continuous development of aerenchyma with plant growth resulting in enhanced MTC. In all cultivars, tiller numbers were linearly related to MTC indicating that the number of outlets determines CH4 transport. The relative MTC of different cultivars for the complete season ranged from 62 to 445% of IR72. These results clearly demonstrate that rice cultivars differ widely in MTC. Therefore, the use of high-yielding cultivars with low MTC (e.g. KDML 105, IR65598 and PR 108) could be an economically feasible, environmentally sound and promising approach to mitigate CH4 emissions from rice fields.

		Navea, I. P.	Identification of quantitative trait loci for panicle length and yield related traits under different water and P application conditions in tropical region in rice (Oryza sativa L.)		Euphytica	2017	volume 37; 12 pages, ill. Ref.	Climate change is projected to have a serious impact on the yield potential of rice in tropical as well as in temperate countries. It is therefore essential to develop rice varieties which are climate change ready and with stable yield when grown under low inputs of irrigation water and fertilizer. In this study, the effects of the shift from temperate to tropical environment as well as the different levels of water regime-phosphorus application were evaluated using a set of temperate recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Dasanbyeo (Tongil-type indica) and TR22183 (temperate japonica). Here, we have identified genetic mechanisms for yield stability mainly by observing the panicle length in the RILs and the parental lines. TR22183 grown in the Philippines showed no reduction in panicle length whereas the Dasanbyeo exhibited a considerable reduction in panicle length when grown in the Philippines compared to those grown in Korea. In the RILs, a total of 18 QTLs for panicle length were identified across 12 chromosomes except in chromosomes 6 and 7. There were six interesting panicle length QTLs, qPL1.4, qPL2.1, qPL2.2, qPL4.1, qPL9.2, and qPL11.2 on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 9, and 11 respectively. They were clustered together with other yield-related QTLs such as spikelet number and grain number in two different years. Except for qPL2.1, all the beneficial alleles originated from TR22183. The panicle length QTLs were identified across different water-P treatments. Interestingly, qPL1.4, qPL2.1, qPL4.1, and qPL11.2 were constantly detected in the low-input tropical condition. No QTL for panicle length was identified in the parallel experiment conducted under temperate conditions in Korea suggesting that the QTLs identified in tropical conditions could be useful in breeding programs to develop rice varieties that have stable yield potential under a warming temperate climate.

		Onaga, G.	High temperature effects on Pi54 conferred resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in two genetic backgrounds of Oryza sativa		Journal of Plant Physiology 	2017	(e-first copy): 39 pages, ill. Ref.	The global temperatures are predicted to rise due to climate change. However, knowledge on the mechanisms underlying the effect of high temperature (HT) on plant pathogen interaction is limited. We investigated the effect of elevated temperature on host phenotypic, biochemical and gene expression patterns in the rice-Magnaporthe oryzae (Mo) pathosystem using two genetic backgrounds, Co39 (Oryzae sativa-indica) and LTH (O. sativa-japonica) with (CO and LT) and without (Co39 and LTH) R gene (Pi54). After exposure to 28° C and 35° C the two genetic backgrounds showed contrasting responses to Mo. At 28 °C, CO, Co39 and LTH displayed a more severe disease phenotype than LT. Surprisingly, CO became resistant to Mo after exposure to 35 °C. CO and LT were used for further analysis to determine the defence related biochemical and transcriptome changes associated with HT induced resistance, and the contrasting reactions to Mo observed in CO and LT despite carrying the same R gene. Pre-exposure to 35 °C triggered intense callose deposits and cell wall fluorescence of the attacked epidermal cells, as well as, increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and salicylic acid (SA) levels. On the other hand, transcriptional changes due to combined stress (35 °C + Mo) were largely overridden by pathogen infection in both backgrounds, suggesting that the plants tended to shift their response to the pathogen. However, significant differences in global gene expression patterns occurred between CO and LT backgrounds in response to both single (35 °C and Mo) and double stress (35 °C + Mo). Collectively, our results suggest that rice lines carrying Pi54 respond to Mo by rapid induction of callose and H2O2, and that these resistance mechanisms are amplified at HT. The relative difference in disease severity between CO and LT at 28 °C suggests that the genetic background of japonica rice facilitates the function of Pi54 more than the background of indica rice. The phenotypic plasticity and gene expression differences between CO and LT backgrounds reveal the presence of intricate molecular signatures that may potentially influence adaptation to plant stresses.

		Savary, S.	Crop health and its global impacts on the components of food security		Food Security	2017	(e-first copy): 17 pages, ill. Ref.	The literature on the importance of plant pathogens sometimes emphasizes their possible role in historical food shortages and even in famines. Aside from such major crises, plant pathogens should also be seen as important reducers of crop performances, with impacts on system sustainability, from the ecological, agronomical, social, and economic standpoints – all contributing ultimately to affecting food security. These views need reconciliation in order to produce a clearer picture of the multidimensional effects of plant disease epidemics. Such a picture is needed for disease management today, but would also be useful for future policies. This article attempts to develop a framework that would enable assessment of the impacts of plant diseases, referred collectively to as crop health, on food security via its components. We have combined three different existing definitions of food security in order to develop a framework consisting of the following six components: (1) Availability. Primary production; (2) Availability. Import - Stockpiles; (3) Access. Physical and supply chain; (4) Access. Economic; (5) Stability of food availability; (6) Utility-Safety-Quality-Nutritive value. In this framework, components of food security are combined with three attributes of production situations: the nature of the considered crop (i.e. food- or non-food), the structure of farms (i.e. subsistence or commercial), and the structure of markets (i.e. weakly organized and local, to strongly organized and globalized). The resulting matrix: [Food security components] × [Attributes of production situations] provides a framework where the impacts of chronic, acute, and emerging plant disease epidemics on food security can be examined. We propose that, given the number of components and interactions at play, a systems modelling approach is required to address the functioning of food systems exposed to plant disease risks. This approach would have application in both the management of the current attrition of crop performances by plant diseases, and also of possible disease-induced shocks. Such an approach would also enable quantifying shifts in disease vulnerability of production situations, and therefore, of food systems, as a result of climate change, globalization, and evolving crop health.

		Akter, S.	Climate change skepticism and index versus standard crop insurance demand in coastal Bangladesh		Regional Environmental Change	2017	volume 17; pages 2455-2466, ill. Ref.	This paper investigates if climate change skepticism, farmers’ fatalistic beliefs, and insurance plan design influence interest in crop weather insurance. While studies of the influence of fatalism on disaster preparedness are common, the ways in which fatalism influences climate change skepticism, and in turn affects farmers’ interest in crop insurance, have not been previously investigated. An additional objective was to understand farmers’ preferences for index versus standard insurance options, the former entailing damage compensation based on post-hazard assessment, the latter tying damage compensation to a set of weather parameter thresholds. A discrete choice experiment was conducted with maize farmers on a climate-risk prone island in coastal Bangladesh. Most farmers were insurance averse. Those who chose insurance were however significantly more likely to select standard as opposed to index-based insurance. Insurance demand was significantly and positively correlated with farmers’ concern about the adverse livelihood impacts of climate change. Farmers who exhibited fatalistic views regarding the consequences of climate change were significantly less likely to opt for insurance of either kind. These findings imply that the prospect for farmers’ investment in insurance is conditioned by their understanding of climate change risks and the utility of adaptation, in addition to insurance scheme design.

		Mishra, A. K.	Perception of climate change and adaptation strategies in Vietnam: are there intra-household gender differences?		International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management 	2017	volume 9, no. 4; pages 501-516, ill. Ref.	Purpose This study first examines the factors affecting the intra-household perception of climate change. Secondly, the study investigates the impact of the perception of climatic stress on operators’ and spouses’ intra-household adaptation strategies (farm and household financial strategies).  Design/methodology/approach The study uses household survey data from Vietnam’s Mekong Delta. The study uses probit and negative binomial count data approaches to evaluate the empirical model.  Findings Results confirm the existence of intra-household gender differences in the adaptation strategies. The authors found that although spouses perceive climatic stress, they are less likely to adapt to such stresses when it comes farming enterprise, but more likely to adapt to household financial strategies. On the other hand, farm operators, in the presence of climatic stresses, undertake both farm and household finance adaptation strategies.  Practical implications Investment in climate smart agriculture can help households in managing climatic stresses.  Originality/value A farmer in Asia, and Vietnam in particular faces significant risks from climatic changes. In Vietnam, agriculture is easily affected by natural disasters and climatic changes. This study provides insights into the perception of climatic changes by operators and spouses in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta. Perceived changes in the climate have a greater impact on women because they typically lack the necessary tools to adapt to climate change. The current findings could be useful in managing climatic risk in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta; helpful to policymakers in designing risk management strategies, in response to climatic changes.

		Akter, S.	The influence of gender and product design on farmers’ preferences for weather-indexed crop insurance		Global Environmental Change 38 (2016): 217-229.	2016	volume 38; pages 217-229.	Theoretically, weather-index insurance is an effective risk reduction option for small-scale farmers in low income countries. Renewed policy and donor emphasis on bridging gender gaps in development also emphasizes the potential social safety net benefits that weather-index insurance could bring to women farmers who are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change risk and have low adaptive capacity. To date, no quantitative studies have experimentally explored weather-index insurance preferences through a gender lens, and little information exists regarding gender-specific preferences for (and constraints to) smallholder investment in agricultural weather-index insurance. This study responds to this gap, and advances the understanding of preference heterogeneity for weather-index insurance by analysing data collected from 433 male and female farmers living on a climate change vulnerable coastal island in Bangladesh, where an increasing number of farmers are adopting maize as a potentially remunerative, but high-risk cash crop. We implemented a choice experiment designed to investigate farmers’ valuations for, and trade-offs among, the key attributes of a hypothetical maize crop weather-index insurance program that offered different options for bundling insurance with financial saving mechanisms. Our results reveal significant insurance aversion among female farmers, irrespective of the attributes of the insurance scheme. Heterogeneity in insurance choices could however not be explained by differences in men’s and women’s risk and time preferences, or agency in making agriculturally related decisions. Rather, gendered differences in farmers’ level of trust in insurance institutions and financial literacy were the key factors driving the heterogeneous preferences observed between men and women. Efforts to fulfill gender equity mandates in climate-smart agricultural development programs that rely on weather-index insurance as a risk-abatement tool are therefore likely to require a strengthening of institutional credibility, while coupling such interventions with financial literacy programs for female farmers.

		Campbell, B. M.	Reducing risks to food security from climate change		Global Food Security 	2016	volume 11; pages 34-43, ill. Ref.	Climate change will have far-reaching impacts on crop, livestock and fisheries production, and will change the prevalence of crop pests. Many of these impacts are already measurable. Climate impact studies are dominated by those on crop yields despite the limitations of climate-crop modelling, with very little attention paid to more systems components of cropping, let alone other dimensions of food security. Given the serious threats to food security, attention should shift to an action-oriented research agenda, where we see four key challenges: (a) changing the culture of research; (b) deriving stakeholder-driven portfolios of options for farmers, communities and countries; (c) ensuring that adaptation actions are relevant to those most vulnerable to climate change; (d) combining adaptation and mitigation.

		Pathak, H.	Global warming mitigation potential of biogas plants in India.	Environ. Monit. Assess. 157(1/4): 407-418, ill. Ref. Oct.		2009		An in situ temperature-controlled field chamber was developed for studying a large population of rice plant under different nighttime temperature treatments while maintaining conditions similar to those in the field during daytime. The system consists of a pipe hoop shed-type chamber with manually removable covers manipulated to provide a natural environment at daytime and a relatively stable and accurate temperature at night. Average air temperatures of 22.4 ± 0.3°C at setting of 22°C, 27.6 ± 0.4°C at 27°C, and 23.8 ± 0.7°C ambient conditions were maintained with the system. No significant horizontal and vertical differences in temperature were found and only slight changes in water temperatures were observed between the chambers and ambient conditions at 36 days after transplanting. A slight variation in CO2 concentration was observed at the end of the treatment during the day, but the 10-μmol CO2 mol−1 difference was too small to alter plant response. The present utilitarian system, which only utilizes an air conditioner/heater, is suitable for studying the effect of nighttime temperature on plant physiological responses with minimal perturbation of other environmental factors. At the same time, it will enable in situ screening of many rice genotypes	ENG.	Also available in electronic format (PDF).

May 	Climate envelope models (CEMs) have been used to predict the distribution of species under current, past, and future climatic conditions by inferring a species' environmental requirements from localities where it is currently known to occur. CEMs can be evaluated for their ability to predict current species distributions but it is unclear whether models that are successful in predicting current distributions are equally successful in predicting distributions under different climates (i.e. different regions or time periods). We evaluated the ability of CEMs to predict species distributions under different climates by comparing their predictions with those obtained with a mechanistic model (MM). In an MM the distribution of a species is modeled based on knowledge of a species' physiology. The potential distributions of 100 plant species were modeled with an MM for current conditions, a past climate reconstruction (21 000 years before present) and a future climate projection (double preindustrial CO2 conditions). Point localities extracted from the currently suitable area according to the MM were used to predict current, future, and past distributions with four CEMs covering a broad range of statistical approaches: Bioclim (percentile distributions), Domain (distance metric), GAM (general additive modeling), and Maxent (maximum entropy). Domain performed very poorly, strongly underestimating range sizes for past or future conditions. Maxent and GAM performed as well under current climates as under past and future climates. Bioclim slightly underestimated range sizes but the predicted ranges overlapped more with the ranges predicted with the MM than those predicted with GAM did. Ranges predicted with Maxent overlapped most with those produced with the MMs, but compared with the ranges predicted with GAM they were more variable and sometimes much too large. Our results suggest that some CEMs can indeed be used to predict species distributions under climate change, but individual modeling approaches should be validated for this purpose, and model choice could be made dependent on the purpose of a particular study.

	1537744X (Online)	Chen, S.	The chamber for studying rice response to elevated nighttime temperature in field.		The Scientific World Journal	2013	volume 2013, no. 647897; 8  pages, ill. Ref.	An in situ temperature-controlled field chamber was developed for studying a large population of rice plant under different nighttime temperature treatments while maintaining conditions similar to those in the field during daytime. The system consists of a pipe hoop shed-type chamber with manually removable covers manipulated to provide a natural environment at daytime and a relatively stable and accurate temperature at night. Average air temperatures of 22.4 ± 0.3°C at setting of 22°C, 27.6 ± 0.4°C at 27°C, and 23.8 ± 0.7°C ambient conditions were maintained with the system. No significant horizontal and vertical differences in temperature were found and only slight changes in water temperatures were observed between the chambers and ambient conditions at 36 days after transplanting. A slight variation in CO2 concentration was observed at the end of the treatment during the day, but the 10-μmol CO2 mol−1 difference was too small to alter plant response. The present utilitarian system, which only utilizes an air conditioner/heater, is suitable for studying the effect of nighttime temperature on plant physiological responses with minimal perturbation of other environmental factors. At the same time, it will enable in situ screening of many rice genotypes	ENG.	Available in electronic format (PDF).

		Hijmans, R. J.	The ability of climate envelope models to predict the effect of climate change on species distributions		Global change biology	2006	Volume 12, no. 12; pages 2272-2281, ill. Ref.	Climate envelope models (CEMs) have been used to predict the distribution of species under current, past, and future climatic conditions by inferring a species' environmental requirements from localities where it is currently known to occur. CEMs can be evaluated for their ability to predict current species distributions but it is unclear whether models that are successful in predicting current distributions are equally successful in predicting distributions under different climates (i.e. different regions or time periods). We evaluated the ability of CEMs to predict species distributions under different climates by comparing their predictions with those obtained with a mechanistic model (MM). In an MM the distribution of a species is modeled based on knowledge of a species' physiology. The potential distributions of 100 plant species were modeled with an MM for current conditions, a past climate reconstruction (21 000 years before present) and a future climate projection (double preindustrial CO2 conditions). Point localities extracted from the currently suitable area according to the MM were used to predict current, future, and past distributions with four CEMs covering a broad range of statistical approaches: Bioclim (percentile distributions), Domain (distance metric), GAM (general additive modeling), and Maxent (maximum entropy). Domain performed very poorly, strongly underestimating range sizes for past or future conditions. Maxent and GAM performed as well under current climates as under past and future climates. Bioclim slightly underestimated range sizes but the predicted ranges overlapped more with the ranges predicted with the MM than those predicted with GAM did. Ranges predicted with Maxent overlapped most with those produced with the MMs, but compared with the ranges predicted with GAM they were more variable and sometimes much too large. Our results suggest that some CEMs can indeed be used to predict species distributions under climate change, but individual modeling approaches should be validated for this purpose, and model choice could be made dependent on the purpose of a particular study.
