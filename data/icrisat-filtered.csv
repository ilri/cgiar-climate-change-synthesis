Scenarios of sustainable fodder production in the conflict-affected Kerio Valley of Kenya,"Mutinda, R; Kimurto, P; Hauser, M",ICRISAT(Nairobi); Egerton University(Njoro); University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences(Vienna),"Communities that keep livestock depend on forages. Understanding the potential futures of livestock forages in regions affected by climate change and resource conflict is critical for climate security and peace. However, often there is limited data on future fodder developments and their drivers. This article presents the results of a scenario development process to identify livestock forage options against conflict scenarios in the Kerio Valley in Kenya. The Valley is of interest because of ongoing communal conflicts, whereby one of the triggers is disputes over pasture during drought emergencies. Given the absence of data, we underwent a participatory scenario development process to co-design fodder futures with representatives of warring communities, market players, the local administration and researchers from Egerton University who worked in the region to mitigate drought risks in the area. Through this process, the representatives developed six strategic fodder scenarios and examined them against four likely stability contexts. The findings from the scenario workshops identify strategies to support the most promising scenarios. Kerio Valley actors could adopt those fodder scenarios that mitigate the risk of resource conflicts, especially in preparation for reoccurring droughts emergencies. Finally, our research suggests that where conflict parties jointly search for fodder solutions, scenario planning could contribute to peace-building.",10.1016/j.futures.2023.103317,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12697,2023-12-30,Futures,0016-3287,Elsevier,156,,livestock; fodder; kenya; forages,,

In this review, we provide a roadmap for improved crop production that encompasses the effective transfer of current knowledge into plant breeding and crop management strategies that will underpin sustainable agriculture intensification and climate resilience. We identify the main problem areas and highlight outstanding questions and potential solutions that can be applied to mitigate the impacts of climate change on crop

Enabling gender and social inclusion in climate and agriculture policy and planning through foresight processes: assessing challenges and leverage points,"Marty, E; Segnon, A C; Tui, S H; Trautman, S; Huyer, S; Cramer, L; Mapedza, E",ILRI(Nairobi); Norwegian University of Life Sciences(Norway); CIAT(Dakar); University of Abomey-Calavi(Cotonou); ICRISAT(Malawi); CIAT(Lilongwe); Independent Consultant(Nairobi),"Scenario-guided foresight processes are increasingly used to engage a broad range of stakeholders in sharing knowledge, reflecting, and setting priorities to respond to present and future climate change related dynamics. They are particularly useful to inform agricultural policies and planning in the face of a changing climate. Such participatory approaches are key to integrating multidisciplinary expertise, perspectives, and viewpoints, and ensuring that the multi-faceted vulnerabilities and the development needs of diverse groups are addressed in the design, planning, and implementation of climate adaptation policy. However, in practice, ensuring meaningful participation in the policy process is far from straightforward. In this paper, we examine the integration of gender and social inclusion considerations in 15 scenario-guided foresight use cases across Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia to determine the ways in which gender and social inclusion dynamics were considered and integrated at different stages of scenario-guided planning processes. To inform the analysis, we use qualitative data from key informant interviews, interviewing scenario coordinators and a gender and social inclusion expert who was engaged in one of the cases; we also review associated reports and outputs. The results suggest that few scenario-guided planning processes centred gender and social inclusion considerations from an early stage and consistently throughout the interventions, translating often into low diversity of stakeholders and insufficient depth reached in the content produced. A number of common challenges are reported including time, budget, and human resource constraints, as well as existing power and institutional dynamics. The latter includes, for instance, low women’s representation in technical organizations or important hierarchical social norms structuring discussions. While the focus on the future can disrupt established modes of doing, the complexity of foresight methods can also undermine effective participation leading to important trade-offs. Innovations in the modes of engagement and parallel processes with diverse groups can be important leverage points for inclusion within policymaking processes.

Key policy insights
Gender and social inclusion should be prioritized from the onset and integrated at different stages of scenario-guided planning processes, notably by allocating more time, human, and financial resources to ensure inclusiveness.

Parallel consultations among diverse organizations and groups can provide effective spaces for often-sidelined or marginalized groups’ interests and needs to be integrated into policy decision-making given the existing power structures that regulate access to many workshops and related discussions. Multi-scale engagements with different networks also help deepen understanding and reconcile gaps across scales of decision-making (e.g. from local level to national level).

Practitioners should further their use of foresight processes and development of tools and methods for integrating gender and social inclusion in these as part of the policy process, as well as strengthen the capacities, expertise, and role of conveners.

Promotion and dissemination of existing gender and social inclusion research and documentation as well as support for learning and reflection to refine identified leverage points can lead to improved success.",10.1080/14693062.2023.2268042,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12523,2023-11-17,Climate Policy,1752-7457,Taylor & Francis Group,,,foresight; climate change; gender; social inclusion; stakeholder engagement; scenario planning,,1-16
Advances and opportunities in unraveling cold-tolerance mechanisms in the world’s primary staple food crops,"Jan, S; Rustgi, S; Barmukh, R; Shikari, A B; Leske, B; Bekuma, A; Sharma, D; Ma, W; Kumar, U; Bohra, A; Varshney, R K; Mir, R R",SKUAST-Kashmir(Sopore Kashmir); Clemson University(South Carolina); ICRISAT(Patancheru); Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development(South Perth); Murdoch University(Murdoch); Qingdao Agriculture University(Qingdao); Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Rohilkhand University(Uttar Pradesh); Borlaug Institute for South Asia(Punjab),"Temperatures below or above optimal growth conditions are among the major stressors affecting productivity, end-use quality, and distribution of key staple crops including rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and maize (Zea mays L.). Among temperature stresses, cold stress induces cellular changes that cause oxidative stress and slowdown metabolism, limit growth, and ultimately reduce crop productivity. Perception of cold stress by plant cells leads to the activation of cold-responsive transcription factors and downstream genes, which ultimately impart cold tolerance. The response triggered in crops to cold stress includes gene expression/suppression, the accumulation of sugars upon chilling, and signaling molecules, among others. Much of the information on the effects of cold stress on perception, signal transduction, gene expression, and plant metabolism are available in the model plant Arabidopsis but somewhat lacking in major crops. Hence, a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which staple crops respond to cold stress remain largely unknown. Here, we make an effort to elaborate on the molecular mechanisms employed in response to low-temperature stress. We summarize the effects of cold stress on the growth and development of these crops, the mechanism of cold perception, and the role of various sensors and transducers in cold signaling. We discuss the progress in cold tolerance research at the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome levels and highlight how these findings provide opportunities for designing cold-tolerant crops for the future.",10.1002/tpg2.20402,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12524,2023-11-13,The Plant Genome,1940-3372,Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of Crop Science Society of America,,,rice; wheat; maize; temperature stresses; cold stress; oxidative stress; slowdown metabolism; limit growth; crop productivity; climate change,,1-23
Characterization of Barley Genotypes and Their Biochemical Responses against Leaf Rust (Puccinia hordei) Disease under Cold Arid Environment,"Hussain, B; Mohiddin, M A; Wani, S H; Murtaza, I; Ahmad, S; Mohammed, R; Rehman, M; Rana, A; Al-ashkar, I; Rahman, M A; Ditta, A; Sabagh, A E",Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences of Technology of Kashmir(Jammu and Kashmir); ICRISAT(Bamako); Madhav University(Rajasthan); King Saud University(Riyadh); National Institute of Animal Science(Cheonan); Shaheed Benazir Bhutto University Sheringal(Khyber Pakhtunkhwa); The University of Western Australia(Perth); Kafrelsheikh University(Kafr El-Shaikh),"Cereal rust is one of the most damaging diseases of small-grain cereals. The fungus Puccinia hordei causes leaf rust in barley and other small grain crops. Puccinia hordei causes serious yield losses in the cultivating areas where susceptible and late-maturing barley varieties are cultivated. Therefore, rust-resistant barley cultivar is highly demandable for sustainable small-grain crop production. Improving barley yields and quality is one of the major objectives of barley breeding programs in our country. Exotic and indigenous germplasm is one of the best sources of resistance to biotic stresses in barley particularly leaf rust caused by Puccinia hordei. Hence, the present investigation was carried out to identify the resistance sources to P. hordei and incorporate them into the breeding programs for higher barley yields under changing climatic scenarios. The study aimed to identify new resistant cultivars in barley and other small grain crops. In this study, 100 barley genotypes (Hordeum vulgare L.) were considered for screening susceptibility to P. hordei causing rust disease. Several biochemical responses were analyzed in P. hordei infected barley genotypes. However, the variable response was observed among the 100 barley genotypes while those were screened against leaf rust disease under high altitude cold arid conditions of Ladakh, India. The efficiency of the 100 barley genotypes were categorized into different classes including high resistance (4 genotypes)>resistance (14 genotypes)> moderately resistance (20 genotypes)> moderately susceptible (33 genotypes)>moderately susceptible to susceptible (19 genotypes)> and susceptible (10 genotypes) based on plant response to P. hordei. Among the total genotypes, SHEIKH/KP-706, SHEIKH-B1, SHEIKH-636, and IC-062190 showed high resistance (8.07-8.63) as per the international leaf rust scale, while EC-667381, EC-667390, EC-667392, EC667396, EC-667417, Jyoti, EC-667434, EC-667442, EC-667445, and EC-667446 were found as susceptible (3.13-3.97) to P. hordei. The highly resistant genotypes accumulated a high level of phenols and flavonoids and cooperated with susceptible and other rest of the genotypes in response to P. hordei rust. The efficiency of plant immune response and or fitness to P. hordei was correlated to the disease susceptibility index of particular genotypes. This provides a new insight and the mechanistic basis of genotype-specific rust disease susceptibility against P. hordei. A large number of genotype-based studies at the field level could be useful to plant breeders and farmers for improving rust resistance in barley and other small-grain cereals.",10.15244/pjoes/170775,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12742,2023-11-03,Polish Journal of Environmental Studies,2083-5906,HARD Publishing Company,33,1,leaf rust; genotype; climate change; biotic stress; disease susceptibility,,185-195
Crop models for assessing impact and adaptation options under climate change,"Singh, P",ICRISAT(Patancheru),"Increased amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere will cause climate change that will adversely impact crop production especially in the arid and semi-arid regions of the developing countries. Development and implementation of field level adaptations measures to cope up with  climate  change  are  necessary  to  the  farmers  whose  livelihood  depends  on  crop-based  income.  Crop  simulation  models  that  incorporate  soil-crop-climate processes of plant growth and that are sensitive to climate change factors can be used to quantify impact of climate change on crop production and evaluating and prioritizing adaptation measures at farm level. This paper analyses the impacts of climate change and plau-sible agronomic, land and water management and genetic adaptations options for the major crops of the semi-arid tropical region with examples from selected sites in India and other developing countries. The crop models need to be linked to the improved pest, disease and weed models to analyze and predict yield losses, especially those due to climate change.

This field is rapidly gaining prominence in sustainability science and has become one of the primary research paradigms. In our study, we conducted scientometrics analysis using the ISI Web of Science core collection database to examine research patterns and frontier areas in SL research. We selected 6441 papers and 265,759 references related to SL published from 1991 to 2020. To achieve this, we employed advanced quantitative analysis tools such as CiteSpace and VOSviewer to quantitatively analyze and visualize the evolution of literature in the SL research field. Our overarching objectives were to understand historical research characteristics, identify the knowledge base, and determine future research trends. The results revealed an exponential increase in SL research documentation since 1991, with the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Center (CGIAR) contributing the highest volume of research documents and citations. Key journals in this field included World Development, Global Environmental Change, Ecological Economics, and Ecology and Society. Notably, Singh RK and Shackleton CM emerged as prolific authors in SL research. Through our analysis, we identified six primary clusters of research areas: livelihoods, conservation, food security, management, climate change, and ecosystem services. Additionally, we found that tags such as rural household, agricultural intensification, cultural intensification, and livelihoods vulnerability remained relevant and represented active research hotspots. By analyzing keyword score relevance, we identified frontier areas in SL research, including mass tourism, solar home systems, artisanal and small-scale mining, forest quality, marine-protected areas, agricultural sustainability, sustainable rangeland management, and indigenous knowledge.

Data-driven approaches to improve water-use efficiency and drought resistance in crop plants,"Sharma, N; Raman, H; Wheeler, D; Kalenahalli, Y; Sharma, R",Orange Agricultural Institute(Orange); Wagga Wagga Agricultural Institute(Wagga Wagga); ICRISAT(Patancheru); BITS Pilani(Rajasthan),"With the increasing population, there lies a pressing demand for food, feed and fibre, while the changing climatic conditions pose severe challenges for agricultural production worldwide. Water is the lifeline for crop production; thus, enhancing crop water-use efficiency (WUE) and improving drought resistance in crop varieties are crucial for overcoming these challenges. Genetically-driven improvements in yield, WUE and drought tolerance traits can buffer the worst effects of climate change on crop production in dry areas. While traditional crop breeding approaches have delivered impressive results in increasing yield, the methods remain time-consuming and are often limited by the existing allelic variation present in the germplasm. Significant advances in breeding and high-throughput omics technologies in parallel with smart agriculture practices have created avenues to dramatically speed up the process of trait improvement by leveraging the vast volumes of genomic and phenotypic data. For example, individual genome and pan-genome assemblies, along with transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteomic data from germplasm collections, characterised at phenotypic levels, could be utilised to identify marker-trait associations and superior haplotypes for crop genetic improvement. In addition, these omics approaches enable the identification of genes involved in pathways leading to the expression of a trait, thereby providing an understanding of the genetic, physiological and biochemical basis of trait variation. These data-driven gene discoveries and validation approaches are essential for crop improvement pipelines, including genomic breeding, speed breeding and gene editing.

Studying the effect of conservation agriculture (CA) on SOC dynamics in the presence of two distinctively different
hydro-thermal regimes across the year in rice–wheat (RW) systems in eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (E-IGP) is of topical interest. The stabilization mechanism of soil organic matter (SOM), and its effect on C mineralization kinetics in these conditions is not well understood. We collected soil samples from six combinations of CA and conventional farming in an ongoing experiment at CIMMYT-Borlaug Institute for South Asia, Bihar, India. CA enhanced SOC, specifically labile C, while decreasing mineral N, as a result of encapsulation/assimilation in aggregates/microbial biomass. Humic acids registered characteristic Fourier

SM35 displayed temperature-mediated higher decay of SOC. Decay constants of C
mineralization were lesser under CA compared with CT. CA promoted higher SOM stability, evidenced by lower decay rates of SOC and N, attributed to (1) better protection of SOM in well-aggregated soil structure and (2) an excess supply of fresh crop residues ensuring higher rate of SOM formation than its decay.

The major challenge lies in maintaining the quantity and quality of protein and other nutritional compounds in view of climate change conditions. The global need for plant-based proteins has increased the demand for seeds with a high protein content that includes essential amino acids. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have evolved as a standard approach in agricultural genetics for examining such intricate characters. Recent development in machine learning methods shows promising applications for dimensionality reduction, which is a major challenge in GWAS. With the advancement in biotechnology, sequencing, and bioinformatics tools, estimation of linkage disequilibrium (LD) based associations between a genome-wide collection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and desired phenotypic traits has become accessible. The markers from GWAS could be utilized for genomic selection (GS) to predict superior lines by calculating genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs). For prediction accuracy, an assortment of statistical models could be utilized, such as ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (rrBLUP), genomic best linear unbiased predictor (gBLUP), Bayesian, and random forest (RF). Both naturally diverse germplasm panels and family-based breeding populations can be used for association mapping based on the nature of the breeding system (inbred or outbred) in the plant species. MAGIC, MCILs, RIAILs, NAM, and ROAM are being used for association mapping in several crops. Several modifications of NAM, such as doubled haploid NAM (DH-NAM), backcross NAM (BC-NAM), and advanced backcross NAM (AB-NAM), have also been used in crops like rice, wheat, maize, barley mustard, etc. for reliable marker-trait associations (MTAs), phenotyping accuracy is equally important as genotyping. Highthroughput genotyping, phenomics, and computational techniques have advanced during the past few years, making it possible to explore such enormous datasets. Each population has unique virtues and flaws at the genomics and phenomics levels, which will be covered in more detail in this review study.

Conservation agriculture for regenerating soil health and climate change mitigation in smallholder systems of South Asia,"Jat, M L; Gathala, M K; Choudhary, M; Sharma, S; Jat, H S; Gupta, N; Singh, Y",ICRISAT(Patancheru); CIMMYT (New Delhi); CIMMYT(Dhaka),"The increase in agriculture production to meet the food demand of growing human population from a limited availability of arable land with low environmental footprints and preserving natural resources (soil, water and air) simultaneously are major challenges in South Asia. The situation is further complicated by the climate change, which will further lower the food production, compounding the challenge of meeting food demand. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is solution to several challenges being faced in farming such as soil health, climate change, water scarcity, agricultural pollution, farm profitability, human health, etc. This exhaustive review examines the published literature from South Asia to assess the impact of CA on soil organic carbon (SOC) and the subsequent impacts on soil health (physical, chemical and biological properties), C sequestration and greenhouse gases emissions in major cropping systems. The results from several studies demonstrated that CA increased SOC and improved soil health parameters, mainly in the surface soil layer. The effects of CA on the changes in soil pH and electrical conductivity are small. The CA showed a remarkable positive impact on the
nutrient availability in the soil. The CA system helped in both climate change mitigation and adaptation for sustainable crop production.

Biochar-based nutrient management as a futuristic scalable strategy for C-sequestration in semiarid tropics,"Kuttippurath, J; Abbhishek, K; Chander, G; Dixit, S; Singh, A; Das, D; Dey, S",Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (Kharagpur); ICRISAT(Patancheru); Dr. Reddy's Foundation (Hyderabad); Shell India Markets Private Ltd (Bengaluru); Adamas University (Barasat),"Climate and agriculture experts emphasize the need to develop a carbon sink in the soil to help alleviate the effects of climate change. A 2-year field experiment in semiarid tropical drylands tested sustainable nutrient management approaches to sequester carbon in the soil. We analyzed nine different treatments, including chemical fertilizers (as blanket and soil test-based [STB] recommendations), sole organic (biochar and compost), and their combinations (with 75% and 50% STB recommendation) as integrated applications (integrated nutrient management [INM]) in the maize–chickpea cropping sequence. We report that biochar treatments show higher (24%–30%) organic carbon stock in the top layer of soil than the respective compost treatments. Furthermore, the biochar-based INM showed the maximum residual effect in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) crops. The system equivalent yield showed the best results (8 Mg ha−1) for 50% need-based fertilizer and 50% biochar. Although we observed that sole-biochar sequestered the highest amount of soil organic carbon (0.69%) in the topsoil compared to the other treatments, it was not scalable due to the lower yield for maize crops. Similarly, composts showed more labile carbon concentrations as microbial biomass but lagged behind biochar treatments for organic carbon storage. The system performance expressed as net returns and benefits–cost ratio also showed better results for biochar-based INM.

The farmers’ varietal and trait preferences were identified through on-farm participatory variety testing and focus group discussions. The findings showed that farmers’ preferred varieties match most often with scientists, and the farmers’ most preferred traits in the study area were yield, yield components, and earliness. The highest average grain yields across environments were recorded from pearl millet variety ICRI-TABI, sorghum variety SSD35, cowpea variety Dan Hajia, and groundnut variety 55-437.

The present study was conducted to develop agricultural water management strategies for improving SWC and to evaluate sowing time as climate change agro-adaptations for sorghum production in SATs. The field experiments on two land-water management (flatbed, broad bed furrows (BBF)) and four nutrient management (application of macro-and micronutrients through combination of chemical and organic fertilizers) were conducted in 2014 and 2015 at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, India. The average SWC in ‘BBF’ was higher over ‘flatbed’ by 0.90 cm and 1.06 cm in 0–30 cm soil depth, 0.67 cm and 1.02 cm in 30–60 cm depth, 0.51 cm and 0.84 cm in

Determinants of adoption and intensity of improved haricot bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) varieties: A Socio-agronomic study from southern Ethiopia,"Cholo, M; Marisennayya, S; Bojago, E; Leja, D; Divya, R K",Wolaita Sodo University (Ethiopia); ICRISAT(Patancheru),"The Haricot bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an important legume crop in Ethiopia, serving as the main cash crop and the least expensive protein source for farmers in many of the lowlands and midlands of the country. This study examines the factors that influence the adoption and intensity of improved haricot bean varieties and associated agronomic techniques in the study area. To choose four rural kebeles (purposive sampling) and 100 (technology user) respondents (systematic random sample), a two-stage selection approach was used. In addition, focus group discussions and key informant interviews were held. The findings of the Tobit econometric model revealed that a wide range of factors had varying effects on adopting better haricot bean production practices. The adoption and intensity of improved haricot bean varieties and related agronomic practices were positively and significantly influenced by the gender of the head of the household, attendance at improved training in haricot bean production, field day programs, demonstrations, access to improved seed credit, and membership in a seed multiplication group, while the market distance was negatively influenced. When evaluating and choosing improved haricot bean varieties, farmers in the study area gave high yield, market demand
and price advantage, maturity time, grain color, grain size, disease resistance, and storage priority. The Nasir
cultivar comes first based on these criteria, followed by the Dimtu cultivar. Furthermore, fewer farmers in the
study area applied fertilizer and seed at rates than advised by research and extension. Lack of extension assistance,
high fertilizer costs, and lack of funds contributed to farmers’ departure from advised packaging practices. To enhance the adoption of improved cultivars, it is suggested that the promotion of improved haricot bean cultivars, as well as improved farmers’ access to extension services and timely market information, be emphasized",10.1016/j.jafr.2023.100656,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12221,2023-05-26,Journal of Agriculture and Food Research,2666-1543,Elsevier B.

We selected shared socioeconomic pathways for scenarios in future climates and simulated the effect of improved practices in the near and distant future. Our simulation results revealed that adopting improved practices enhanced soil carbon at the rate of 0.7% per year and provided additional income from the yield of pulses in the 2-year rotation. Similarly, we observed an increasing trend in SOC building for improved practices in all future climate scenarios.

The increasing global warming makes us revisit climate-resilient strategies to mitigate the risk of climate change on paddy production in agrarian economies. However, adapting to these strategies and impact assessment is necessary to comprehend their productiveness and further policy recommendation. Therefore, this study identifies the determinants of adaptation and measures the impact of these strategies on farm performance (yield and net income) and food security of smallholder paddy farmers in India. We used primary data from 612 paddy farmers from 20 villages in the Hooghly district, West Bengal, India. The study used probit regression analysis to identify adaptation constraints and Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) to determine the change in the direction and magnitude of the determinants of adaptation strategies. The study also used the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) approach to estimate the causal impact of climate adaptation on paddy yield, net income, and food security. Probit model outcomes identified that education level, cooperative membership, access to extension services, and institutional credit adoption positively and significantly impacted climate change adaptation across smallholders. MLR analysis identified that the direction and magnitude of the discussed determinants changed with different combinations of adaptation choices.

Peanuts provide food and nutritional security to millions of people across the globe because of its high nutritive values. Drought and heat stress alone or in combination cause substantial yield losses to peanut production. The stress, in addition, adversely impact nutritional quality. Peanuts exposed to drought stress at reproductive stage are prone to aflatoxin contamination, which imposes a restriction on use of peanuts as health food and also adversely impact peanut trade. A comprehensive understanding of the impact of drought and heat stress at physiological and molecular levels may accelerate the development of stress tolerant productive peanut cultivars adapted to a given production system. Significant progress has been achieved towards the characterization of germplasm for drought and heat stress tolerance, unlocking the physiological and molecular basis of stress tolerance, identifying significant marker-trait associations as well major QTLs and candidate genes associated with drought tolerance, which after validation may be deployed to initiate marker-assisted breeding for abiotic stress adaptation in peanut. The proof of concept about the use of transgenic technology to add value to peanuts has been demonstrated. Advances in phenomics and artificial intelligence to accelerate the timely and cost-effective collection of phenotyping data in large germplasm/breeding populations have also been discussed. Greater focus is needed to accelerate research on heat stress tolerance in peanut.

Establishing Optimal Planting Windows for Contrasting Sorghum Cultivars across Diverse Agro-Ecologies of North-Eastern Nigeria: A Modelling Approach,"Akinseye, F M; Ajeigbe, H A; Kamara, A Y; Omotayo, A O; Tofa, A I; Whitbread, A M",ICRISAT(Nigeria); Centre d’étude régional pour l’amélioration de l’adaptation à la sécheresse (CERAAS); International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (Nigeria); International Livestock Research Institute(Tanzania),"In the context of climate change, the sowing date and cultivar choice can influence the productivity of sorghum, especially where production is constrained by low soil fertility and early terminal drought across the challenging agro-ecologies of north-eastern Nigeria. Planting within an optimal sowing window to fit the cultivar’s maturity length is critical for maximizing/increasing the crop yield following the appropriate climate-smart management practices. In this study, the APSIM crop model was calibrated and validated to simulate the growth and yield of sorghum cultivars with differing maturing periods sown within varying planting time windows under improved agricultural practices. The model was run to simulate long-term crop performance from 1985 to 2010 to determine the optimal planting windows (PWs) and most suitable cultivars across different agro-ecological zones (AEZs). The performance of the model, validated with the observed farm-level grain yield, was satisfactory across all planting dates and cropping systems. The model predicted a lower mean bias error (MBE), either positive or negative, under the sole cropping system in the July sowing month compared to in the June and August sowing months. The seasonal climate simulations across sites and AEZs suggested increased yields when using adapted sorghum cultivars based on the average grain yield threshold of >1500 kgha-1 against the national average of 1160 kgha-1. In the Sudan Savanna (SS), the predicted optimum PWs ranged from 25 May to 30 June for CSR01 and Samsorg-44, while the PWs could be extended to 10 July for ICSV400 and Improved Deko. In the Northern Guinea Savanna (NGS) and Southern Guinea Savanna (SGS), the optimal PWs ranged from 25 May to 10 July for all cultivars except for SK5912, for which predicted optimal PWs ranged from 25 May to 30 June. In the NGS zone, all cultivars were found to be suitable for cultivation with exception of SK5912. Meanwhile, in the SGS zone, the simulated yield below the threshold (1500 kgha-1) could be explained by the sandy soil and the very low soil fertility observed there. It was concluded that farm decisions to plant within the predicted optimal PWs alongside the use of adapted sorghum cultivars would serve as key adaptation strategies for increasing the sorghum productivity in the three AEZs.",10.3390/agronomy13030727,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12059,2023-02-28,Agronomy,20734395,MPDI,13,3,adaptation; agro-ecological zones (aezs); apsim; adapted sorghums; optimal planting window,CGIAR Research Programs Grain Legumes and Dryland Cereals (GLDC); CCAFS; CGIAR; World Bank; USAID,1-24

The objective of this study is to test tillage with residue management under sequential and intercropping systems for carbon sequestration in semi-arid tropical drylands of India. We report the findings from a long-term field experiment (9 years) used to simulate the effect of residue and tillage management in Maize-chickpea sequential and Maize-Pigeonpea intercropping systems for the four possible future climate projections using APSIM model. These findings demonstrate a sustainable route with inclusive growth, as pledged at the UN climate change summit. A comparison of results under SSP 2.6 and 4.5 Wm−2 with SSP 8.5 shows that demand pressure from competitive marketplaces inhibits the establishment of soil carbon sinks and significantly reduces crop yields, likely due to indiscriminate chemical fertilizer use. We observed that a better decision in selecting cropping system might improve soil organic carbon content (SOC). SOC content ranging from 0.9 to 1.2% in Maize-pigeonpea intercropping and 0.85–1.1% in maize-chickpea sequential cropping systems, demonstrate good potential in the climate change mitigation exertions. Early SOC saturation (20 years) led to a decreased carbon stock in topsoil without residue addition practises. The addition of crop residues significantly increased SOC levels under both conventional and minimum tillage and created additional income for farmers. Simulation analysis showed impact of SOC changes on crop yield which remained nearly stable for 85 years.

Improving water use efficiency (WUE) at the plant level is important, but translating this at the farm/landscape level presents considerable challenges. As we move up from the scale of cells, organs, and plants to more integrated scales such as plots, fields, farm systems, and landscapes, other factors such as trade-offs need to be considered to try to improve WUE. These include choices of crop variety/species, farm management practices, landscape design, infrastructure development, and ecosystem functions, where human decisions matter. This review is a cross-disciplinary attempt to analyse approaches to addressing WUE at these different scales, including definitions of the metrics of analysis and consideration of trade-offs.

Vegetables are an essential part of daily human consumption and thus have importance among all agricultural crops. The human population is increasing daily, so there is a need for alternative ways which can be helpful in maximizing the harvestable yield of vegetables. The increase in temperature directly affects the plants’ biochemical and molecular processes; having a significant impact on quality and yield. Breeding for climate-resilient crops with good yields takes a long time and lots of breeding efforts. However, with the advent of new omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, the efficiency and efficacy of unearthing information on pathways associated with high-temperature stress resilience has improved in many of the vegetable crops. Besides omics, the use of genomics-assisted breeding and new breeding approaches such as gene editing and speed breeding allow creation of modern vegetable cultivars that are more resilient to high temperatures. Collectively, these approaches will shorten the time to create and release novel vegetable varieties to meet growing demands for productivity and quality.

Furthermore, farmers perceive that natural resources such as land, water, and biodiversity have been affected due to the variations in the climate. In response to these challenges, farmers have adopted a set of adaptation options, including changes in crop selection, land management, water usage, socio-economic strategies, and collective actions. However, the study found discouraging trends in the adoption of these adaptation options, primarily due to a range of barriers that hinder their ability to adapt efficiently to climate change. This study underscores the critical need for region-specific strategic research and development programs aimed at enhancing the biophysical and socioeconomic conditions of these rural areas. Such efforts would enable these communities to improve their adaptive capacity and livelihood resilience in the face of climate-related risks and impacts. Future policies and programs should prioritize the upliftment of these fragile SAT communities, with the goal of enhancing their resilience to climate change and improving their overall quality of life.",10.56042/ijtk.v22i4.36949,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12490,2023,Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge,0975-1068,CSIR-National Institute of Science Communication and Policy Research (CSIR-NIScPR),22,4,climate change and variability (ccv); semi-arid tropics; rain-fed farming; farmer’s perception; adaptation; vulnerability; climate change,,854-863

We understand gender as a social construct of who women and men are supposed to be. Gender inequalities seem to be enduring such that, despite innovations in agricultural and climate information technologies, unequal gender power dynamics will still
emerge. As far back as the 1960s, the gendered inequalities in accessing technologies could be identified. Such a historical analysis clearly shows that the different technological solutions are clearly embedded within the society in which they evolve in. The paper uses a literature review methodological approach whilst informing the implementation of an ongoing Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) Project. The findings reveal that unless women are intentionally included in designing and developing agricultural technologies, specifically climate information systems, there is a danger that women will be excluded from the benefits. Conway’s law
clearly stipulates that technological innovations are not neutral as they are a projection of the values of their creators. It is, therefore, central to grasp the values of creators of different technological solutions and innovations. The key findings are built around the espoused conceptual framework, which has five indicators, namely: (1) gender targeting by intentional design, (2) collection of sex-disaggregated data, (3) conduct an analysis of the sex-disaggregated data, (4) dissemination of the technological
options and (5) conduct continuous monitoring of gender and ongoing empowerment evaluation. The five indicator domains are further complemented by their respective assumptions. Our GESI recommendations are on the five selected indicator domains. These domains must be used within the three focal development areas: agricultural data hub, climate information services training, and flood and drought indicators, which are all being implemented in Zambia. Other AICCRA Project countries are Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, and Senegal.

Intensifying pearl millet cultivation could boost productivity although it may have trade-offs. Increasing planting density would indeed increase the leaf area and the related water budget, whereas a denser canopy could create a more favorable canopymicroclimate to the benefit of the water use efficiency (WUE) of the crops. The first aim of this work was to test the yield response of popular pearlmillet varieties to an increased density and to assess possible genotypic variation in this response. The second aim was to measure the water use and the WUE of the crop in different densities.
Method: To this end we designed several field and lysimetric experiments To increase the robustness of the results, these trials were carried out in India and Senegal, using two independent sets of genotypes adapted to both sites. 
Results: In the field, the higher sowing density significantly increased yield in all genotypes when trials were carried out in high evaporative demand conditions. There was no genotype x density interaction in these trials, suggesting no genotypic variation in the response to density increase. The high-density treatment also decreased the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in the canopies, both in the field and in the lysimeter experiments. In the lysimeter trials, although the higher density treatment increased water use, the resulting increase in biomass was proportionally higher, hence increasingWUE of the crops in all genotypes under high density. The increase in yield under high density was closely related to the increase in WUE, although this link was more tight in the high- than in the low evaporative demand seasons. This confirmed a strong environmental effect on the response to density of all  genotypes tested.
Discussion: Although they did not open a scope for breeding density tolerant cultivars, these results highlight the possibility to improve pearl millet yield by increasing the density, targeting specifically areas facing high evaporative demand.",10.3389/fpls.2022.1035181,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12087,2022-12-08,Frontiers in Plant Science (TSI),1664-462X,Frontiers Media,13,,climate change; sustainable intensification; canopy architecture; semi-arid tropics; vapor pressure deficit,"Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR, grant ANR-17-MPGA-0011); Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Sustainable Intensification (SIIL); United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Cooperative Agreement (Grant number AID- OAA-L-14-00006)",01-12

mineralization, nitrification and denitrification processes. These processes depend on soil management, e.g.,
tillage and straw addition. Microbial mechanisms underlying the effects of straw addition on N2O emissions were
investigated by 56-day incubation of soil from a long-term (27-year) no-tillage (NoTill) and conventional tillage
(ConvTill) field experiment. The abundance of N functional genes (amoA, amoB, nirK, nirS and nosZ) in no-tillage

allowed us to trace N2O sources. Conventional tillage with 15N-labelled straw (ConvTill+Straw) reduced N2O
emissions derived from soil by 42 %, whereas no-tillage with 15N-labelled straw (NoTill+Straw) reduced N2O
emissions by only 8 % compared with soil without straw addition. The N2O emissions derived from straw were
higher under NoTill+Straw than under ConvTill+Straw, whereas they accounted for only ~4 % of the total N2O
emissions under both conditions. The nirK and nirS gene abundances were higher than those in soil without straw
addition. Compared to that under ConvTill, the nosZ gene abundance was higher and the N2O emissions were 40

In depth bibliometric analysis covering years 2000 – 2020 was performed using Scopus database to gain insight on sorghum research trends and identify gaps and opportunities for the crop. 17,720 relevant documents were retrieved and analysed. Robust increase in research literature on sorghum was observed for the period, more than tripling to almost 1,600/year in 2020. New opportunities stimulated by the sorghum genome sequencing and evolution of the crop as a model for drought tolerance, and growing recognition of sorghum as a potential food and energy security crop in response to climate change were key drivers of research output. Encouraging evidence demonstrates that both sorghum yield and nutritional quality are more stable to climate change compared to major cereal crops like maize and rice. End use trends suggest sorghum is more competitive in the food market than feed and bioenergy markets that have dominated its production in the past. Quality traits identified as most likely to expand long-term sorghum food value chain include endosperm functionality (kafirin protein properties), health (resistant starch and polyphenols), and nutrition (iron and zinc). Gene editing technology has shown promise as a tool to efficiently design sorghums with traits for high value food applications.

Research and development for sorghum and millets in Sub-Saharan Africa: What have we learned?,"Orr, A; Weltzien, E; Rattunde, F",ICRISAT(Nairobi); University of Wisconsin (Madison),"The past two decades of R & D for sorghum and millets in SSA have generated a wealth of new evidence. A synthesis of this evidence identified six strategic lessons. These were that demand is not being driven by ‘new uses’, that plant breeding programmes need to respond to African farmer's contexts and objectives to increase impact, that availability is a bigger constraint on the supply of certified seed than physical or economic access, that higher adoption of improved varieties does not generally result in higher yields, that technology and varietal diversity can compensate for climate change, and that commercialisation can be gender – and socially inclusive. R & D in Africa differs from the Indian model because of the low level of commercialisation and the continued dominance of own consumption. Consequently R & D gives a dominant role to the public sector in plant breeding, to farmer organisations and groups in seed supply, and to prioritising household food security over commercial uses.",10.1177/00307270221133127,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12141,2022-10-30,Outlook on Agriculture,2043-6866,SAGE Publications,51,4,sorghum; millets; research and development; sub-saharan africa,,

In light of projected changes in climate, there is a need to assess the potential impacts on yield productivity and variability among farmers. An evaluated GROPGRO module of the Decision Support System for Agro-technological Transfer (DSSAT) was used to simulate soybean productivity under both historical (1980–2009) and projected climate scenarios from multiple general circulation models (GCMs) under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs): 4.5 and 8.5. Agronomic data from 90 farms, as well as multiple soil profile data, were also used for the impact assessment. Climate change leads to a reduction (3% to 13.5% across GCMs and RCPs) in the productivity of soybean in Northern Ghana.
However, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide has the  potential to offset the negative impact, resulting in increased (14.8% to 31.3% across GCMs and RCPs) productivity. The impact of climate change on yield varied widely amongst farms (with relative standard deviation (RSD) ranging between 17% and 35%) and across years (RSD of between 10% and 15%).

"Investigating the relationship between groundwater augmentation and water quality in the 6000 ha watershed in Telangana state, India","Patil, M D; Davala, M S; Kumar, R S; Dixit, S",ICRISAT(Patancheru),"Groundwater augmentation through rainwater harvesting has become a prime strategy to address water security and cope with the impact of climate change, especially in semi-arid regions. Increased water availability due to groundwater augmentation and its impact on rainfed agriculture has been well documented, but its impact on groundwater quality was rarely explored. In this study, data collected over 33-months on groundwater quality and groundwater table from a micro-watershed spread over 6000 ha in the semi-arid region of peninsular India were explored to assess the association between rainfall, groundwater augmentation, and groundwater quality. It was observed that the groundwater augmentation and related changes in the groundwater levels were influenced by the density of rainwater harvesting structures, rainfall distribution during the rainy season, groundwater withdrawals around the monitoring wells, and the distance between the wells and water storage structures. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchal clustering revealed that the spatial and temporal variations in the groundwater quality governed by hydrogeochemical processes and preferential flow recharge processes might have been affected by groundwater augmentation and withdrawal. The fertilizer use in croplands as a non-point source of NO3–N and NH4–N in groundwater was affected by rainfall distribution. The high NO3–N levels in the vicinity of a burial site had indicated a possible point source of groundwater contamination. About 5%, 76%, 20%, and 4% of water samples were classified as poor, marginal, fair, and good as per the guidelines for drinking water with high fluoride and NH4–N content in groundwater as a point of concern.

We ﬁrst analysed the trade-oﬀ between expected agricultural income in these districts and deviation from it under drought and normal weather scenarios. We extended the conventional MOTAD model with climate-smart technologies to assess their role in minimizing this trade-oﬀ under various weather scenarios. For our analysis, we relied on a ﬁve-year (2010–2011 to 2014–2015), district-level panel dataset on the cost of cultivation and crop production of 11 major crops under six diﬀerent climate-smart technologies and farmers’ traditional practices (FTPs). This dataset included a collation of oﬃcial statistics on the cost of cultivation, focus group interviews with farmers over the years and data from experimental plots operated by regional agricultural research stations. We found that the adoption of CSA technologies in Telangana, compared to FTPs, led to a 16% reduction in production risk while achieving optimum levels of crop income. Under FTPs, in a scenario of the high probability of drought, the production risk is increased by 12% while the adoption of CSA technologies reduced this risk by 25%. Our study suggests that increasing investments in farm ponds and unpuddled machine transplanting of rice can minimize the risk-return trade-oﬀ in a higher drought frequency scenario.

Human plant domestication began in the Fertile Crescent around 12,000 years ago and spread throughout the world, including China, Mesoamerica, the Andes and Near Oceania, Sub-Saharan Africa, and eastern North America. Indus valley civilizations have played a great role in the domestication of grain legumes. Crops, such as pigeon pea, black gram, green gram, lablab bean, moth bean, and horse gram, originated in the Indian subcontinent, and Neolithic archaeological records indicate that these crops were first domesticated by early civilizations in the region. The domestication and evolution of wild ancestors into today’s elite cultivars are important contributors to global food supply and agricultural crop improvement. In addition, food legumes contribute to food security by protecting human health and minimize climate change impacts. During the domestication process, legume crop species have undergone a severe genetic diversity loss, and only a very narrow range of variability is retained in the cultivars. Further reduction in genetic diversity occurred during seed dispersal and movement across the continents. In general, only a few traits, such as shattering resistance, seed dormancy loss, stem growth behavior, flowering–maturity period, and yield traits, have prominence in the domestication process across the species. Thus, identification and knowledge of domestication responsive loci were often useful in accelerating new species’ domestication. The genes and metabolic pathways responsible for the significant alterations that occurred as an outcome of domestication might aid in the quick domestication of novel crops. Further, recent advances in “omics” sciences, gene-editing technologies, and functional analysis will accelerate the domestication and crop improvement of new crop species without losing much genetic diversity. In this review, we have discussed about the origin, center of diversity, and seed movement of major food legumes, which will be useful in the exploration and utilization of genetic diversity in crop improvement. Further, we have discussed about the major genes/QTLs associated with the domestication syndrome in pulse crops and the future strategies to improve the food legume crops.",10.3389/fgene.2022.932430,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12356,2022-07-22,Frontiers in Genetics (TSI),1664-8021,Frontiers Media,13,,evolution; divergence; diversification; domestication; domestication syndrome; pulse crop,,1-21
Exploiting genetic variation from unadapted germplasm—An example from improvement of sorghum in Ethiopia,"Birhan, T; Dong, H; Abajebel, N; Wakjira, M; Lemke, C; Vadez, V",Jimma University(Jimma); University of Georgia(Athens); Mississippi State University(Starkville); ICRISAT(Patancheru),"Societal Impact Statement The productivity of sorghum in Ethiopia has been largely limited by rain-fed condi-
tions because farmers tend to use local drought-tolerant but low-yielding landraces, as high-yielding and late-maturing landrace cultivars risk failure due to drought. Addressing such issues often requires a far-reaching approach to identify and incorporate new traits into a gene pool, followed by a period of selection to re-establish an overall adaptive phenotype. The sorghum backcross nested association mapping (BC-NAM) population developed in this study increases the genetic diversity available in Ethiopian elite adapted sorghum germplasm, providing new scope to improve
food security in a region known for periodic devastating droughts. Summary • As the center of diversity for sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, elite cultivars selected in Ethiopia are of central importance to sub-Saharan food security. Despite being presumably well adapted to their center of diversity, elite Ethiopian sorghums nonetheless experience constraints to productivity, for example, associ-
ated with shifting rainfall patterns associated with climate change.
• A sorghum backcross nested association mapping (BC-NAM) population developed by crossing 13 diverse lines preidentified to have various drought resilience
mechanisms with an Ethiopian elite cultivar, Teshale, was tested under three rainfed environments in Ethiopia.
• Twenty-seven, 15, and 15 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with predominantly small additive effects were identified for days to flowering, days to maturity, and plant height, respectively. Many associations detected in this study corresponded closely to known or candidate genes or previously mapped QTLs, supporting their validity.
• The expectation that genotypes such as Teshale from the center of diversity tend to have a history of strong balancing selection, with novel variations more likely to
persist in small marginal populations, was strongly supported in that for these three traits, nearly equal numbers of alleles from the donor lines conferred
increases and decreases in phenotype relative to the Teshale allele. Such rich variation provides a foundation for selection to arrive at a new “adaptive peak,” exemplifying the nature of efforts that may be necessary to adapt many crops to new climate extremes.",10.1002/ppp3.10292,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12289,2022-07-15,Plants People Planet,2572-2611,John Wiley & Sons Ltd,4,5,adaptive traits; food security; genome-wide association studies; joint linkage analysis; sorghum; sub-saharan,U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),523-536
Potential Targets for CRISPR/Cas Knockdowns to Enhance Genetic Resistance Against Some Diseases in Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.),"Taj, M; Sajjad, M; Li, M; Yasmeen, A; Mubarik, M S; Kaniganti, S; He, C",COMSATS University(Islamabad); Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences(Kunming); University of Narowal(Narowal); ICRISAT(Patancheru),"Wheat is one of the most important food crops worldwide. Even though wheat yields have increased considerably in recent years, future wheat production is predicted to face enormous challenges due to global climate change and new versions of diseases. CRISPR/Cas technology is a clean gene technology and can be efficiently used to target genes prone to biotic stress in wheat genome. Herein, the published research papers reporting the genetic factors corresponding to stripe rust, leaf rust, stem rust, powdery mildew, fusarium head blight and some insect pests were critically reviewed to identify negative genetic factors (Susceptible genes) in bread wheat. Out of all reported genetic factors related to these disease, 33 genetic factors (S genes) were found as negative regulators implying that their down-regulation, deletion or silencing improved disease tolerance/resistance. The results of the published studies provided the concept of proof that these 33 genetic factors are potential targets for CRISPR/Cas knockdowns to improve genetic tolerance/resistance against these diseases in wheat. The sequences of the 33 genes were retrieved and re-mapped on the latest wheat reference genome IWGSC RefSeq v2.1. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that pathogens causing the same type of disease had some common conserved motifs and were closely related. Considering the significance of these disease on wheat yield, the S genes identified in this study are suggested to be disrupted using CRISPR/Cas system in wheat.

Pearl Millet (Pennisetum glaucum) Seedlings Transplanting as Climate Adaptation Option for Smallholder Farmers in Niger,"Traore, B; Moussa, A A; Traore, A; Nassirou, Y S A; Ba, M N; Tabo, R",ICRISAT(Niger); Institut D’Economie Rurale(Koutiala),"Pearl millet is the most widely grown cereal crop in the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, and in Niger in particular. To determine an optimized management strategy for smallholder farmers in southern Niger to cope with crop production failure and improve cropping performance in the context of climate change and variability, multi-site trials were conducted to evaluate the impacts of transplanting on pearl millet growth and productivity. Eight treatments viz. T1-0NPK (100% transplanting without NPK), T1-NPK (100% transplanting + NPK), T2-0NPK (100% transplanting of empty hills without NPK), T2-NPK (100% transplanting of empty hills + NPK), T3-0NPK (50% transplanting of empty hills without NPK), T3-NPK (50% transplanting of empty hills + NPK), T4-0NPK (farmer practice without NPK), and T4-NPK (farmer practice + NPK) were included in the experiment. Compared to farmer practice, transplanting significantly reduced time to tillering, flowering, and maturity stages by 15%, 27%, and 11%, respectively. The results also revealed that T1-NPK significantly increased panicle weight, total biomass, grain yield, and plant height by 40%, 38%, 27%, and 23%, respectively. Farmers’ evaluations of the experiments supported these findings, indicating three substantial advantages of transplanting, including higher yield (37.50% of responses), larger, more vigorous and more panicles (34.17% of responses), and good tillering (28.33% of responses). An economic profitability analysis of the system revealed that biomass gain (XOF 359,387/ha) and grain gain (XOF 324,388/ha) increased by 34% and 22%, respectively, with T1-NPK. Therefore, it can be inferred that transplanting is a promising strategy for adapting millet cultivation to climate change and variability in southern Niger.",10.3390/atmos13070997,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12361,2022-06-21,Atmosphere (TSI),2073-4433,MDPI,13,7,food security; crop failure; mineral fertilization; crop management; sahel,USAID; Catholic Relief Services,1-15
Variation in soil properties under different land use types managed by smallholder farmers in central Ethiopia,"Haile, G; Itanna, F; Teklu, B; Agegnehu, G",Dilla University (Dilla); National University of Lesotho (Roma); Hawass University (Hawassa); ICRISAT (Addis Ababa),"Land use change causes a remarkable change in soil properties. The nature of change depends on multiple factors such as soil type, type and intensity of land use, climate, and the like. It is essential to study and understand how these factors interact and affect soil properties. In this study, we investigated the variation in soil physicochemical properties across five common land use practices, i.e. enset system, farmland, and grazing-land (closed and open), and Eucalyptus woodlots practiced on originally same soil type and comparable topographic and climatic settings. A total of
105 soil samples from three depths of 0–15 cm, 15–30 cm, and 30–45 cm were collected and analyzed for selected soil physicochemical properties. The results showed significant differences between the land uses in soil physical and chemical properties. Enset system had higher pH, available phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K+), soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN) and their stocks than other land use types. Further, the widely accepted notion of
the alleged effects of Eucalyptus tree on soil nutrient composition was not demonstrated in this study except its lower pH of (5.61) and soil moisture contents of (26.14%) than other land use types over 15–20 years old. SOC stocks showed a decreasing trend of enset system (127.36 Mg ha−1) >
closed grazing land (108.07 Mg ha−1) > eucalyptus woodlot (92.55 Mg ha−1) > open grazing-land (88.57 Mg ha−1) > cereal farm (76.65 Mg ha−1) at 0–45 cm soil depth, implying the potential of enset system for climate changes mitigation. TN was also measured in the same trend. Overall, some land
use systems (e. g. enset agroforestry) improve the soil biophysical and chemical properties, while others such as cereal production degrade the soil. The low input continuous cultivation of cereal farm land coupled with its poor soil conservation measures in the area could be the major factors
for the depletion of soil nutrient in cereal farming. Hence, future soil management strategies should be focused on mitigating the continuous loss of soil nutrients from the dominantly practiced cereal cropping system through the retention of crop residues, practice of crop rotation
and scaling-up agro-forestry practice.",10.1080/27658511.2022.2093058,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12160,2022-06-18,Sustainable Environment,2765-8511,Taylor and Francis,8,1,agroforestry; land use; smallholder farmers; soil properties; ethiopia,,01-15

Recognition of the value of landrace diversity and concern about its erosion on farms have led to sustained efforts to establish ex situ collections worldwide. The degree to which these efforts have succeeded in conserving landraces has not been comprehensively assessed. Here we modelled the potential distributions of eco-geographically distinguishable groups of landraces of 25 cereal, pulse and starchy root/tuber/fruit crops within their geographic regions of diversity. We then analysed the extent to which these landrace groups are represented in genebank collections, using geographic and ecological coverage metrics as a proxy for genetic diversity. We find that ex situ conservation of landrace groups is currently moderately comprehensive on average, with substantial variation among crops; a mean of 63% ± 12.6% of distributions is currently represented in genebanks. Breadfruit, bananas and plantains, lentils, common beans, chickpeas, barley and bread wheat landrace groups are among the most fully represented, whereas the largest conservation gaps persist for pearl millet, yams, finger millet, groundnut, potatoes and peas. Geographic regions prioritized for further collection of landrace groups for ex situ conservation include South Asia, the Mediterranean and West Asia, Mesoamerica, sub-Saharan Africa, the Andean mountains of South America and Central to East Asia. With further progress to fill these gaps, a high degree of representation of landrace group diversity in genebanks is feasible globally, thus fulfilling international targets for their ex situ conservation.",10.1038/s41477-022-01144-8,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12450,2022-05-09,Nature Plants,2055-0278,Nature,8,,climate-change adaptation; conservation biology; climate change,,491-499

Optimizing water use efficiency and yield fundamentally involves transpiration dynamics, where restriction of maximum transpiration rate helps to avoid early crop failure, while maximizing grain filling. Transpiration restriction can be regulated by multiple mechanisms and involves cross-organ coordination. This coordination involves complex feedbacks and feedforwards over time scales ranging from minutes to weeks, and from spatial scales ranging from cell membrane to crop canopy. Aquaporins have direct effect but various compensation and coordination pathways involve phenology, relative root and shoot growth, shoot architecture, root length distribution profile, as well as other architectural and anatomical aspects of plant form and function. We propose gravimetric phenotyping as an integrative, cross-scale solution to understand the dynamic, interwoven, and context-dependent coordination of transpiration regulation. The most fruitful breeding strategy is likely to be that which maintains focus on the phene of interest, namely, daily and season level transpiration dynamics.

Crop production models can provide helpful information on agricultural yields under a range of climate change scenarios and on the impact of adaptation strategies. Here, we report a systematic review of the impact of climate change on the yield of major staple crops in West Africa. Unlike earlier reviews we pay particular attention to the potential of common agricultural adaptation strategies (such as optimised planting dates, use of fertilisers and climate-resilient crop varieties) to mitigate the effects of climate change on crop yields. We systematically searched two databases for literature published between 2005 and 2020 and identified 35 relevant studies. We analysed yield changes of major staple crops (maize, sorghum, rice, millet, yam, cassava and groundnuts) caused by different climate change and field management scenarios. Yields declined by a median of 6% (−8% to +2% depending on the crop) due to climate change in all scenarios analysed. We show that the common adaptation strategies could increase crop yields affected by climate change by 13% (−4% to +19% depending on the strategy) as compared to business-as-usual field management practices, and that optimised planting dates and cultivars with longer crop cycle duration could in fact offset the negative effects of climate change on crop yields. Increased fertiliser use has not mitigated the impact of climate change on crops but could substantially increase yields now and in the future. Our results suggest that a combination of increased fertiliser use and adopting cropping practices that take advantage of favourable climate conditions have great potential to protect and enhance future crop production in West Africa.",10.1088/1748-9326/ac61c8,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12642,2022-04-19,Environmental Research Letters (TSI),1748-9326,IOP Publishing,17,5,crop productivity; west africa; climate change impacts; climate change adaptation; climate change,,1-15

The increasing frequency of heavy rain events, can negatively affect the lowland crops’ growth and production. Two-season field experiments were conducted near
Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) to test the effects of temporary flooding and surface water stagnation on maize (Zea mays L.) growth and productivity. The treatments were organized into a split-split plot design. Three factors were monitored, including aboveground flooding levels (i.e., 0 cm, 2–3 cm, and 7–8 cm), flooding duration (i.e., three days and six days), and growth stages (i.e., six-leaf stage (V6),
tasseling stage (VT) and milky stage (R3)). Optimal crop management was practiced to Obatanpa cultivar planted during the rainy season and flooding was induced by over-irrigation. The results show that three days and six days of flooding, reduced grain yield by at least 35% when they occurred at the tasseling stage. Only 4–6 days of flooding reduced grain yield by 21% at the six-leaf stage. Further
scrutiny, using the stress day index (SDI), revealed that the penalty on yield increases exponentially under flooding conditions as the value of the stress day index increases. Considering the new characteristics of the rainfall regime in the West African Sahel, dominated by a high frequency of heavy rain events and wet spells, temporary floods, and water stagnation are tremendously contributing to yield loss of on-farm maize.

R. Br.] is a C4 crop cultivated for its grain and
stover in crop-livestock-based rain-fed farming systems of tropics and subtropics in
the Indian subcontinent and sub-Saharan Africa. The intensity of drought is predicted
to further exacerbate because of looming climate change, necessitating greater focus
on pearl millet breeding for drought tolerance. The nature of drought in different target
populations of pearl millet-growing environments (TPEs) is highly variable in its timing,
intensity, and duration. Pearl millet response to drought in various growth stages
has been studied comprehensively. Dissection of drought tolerance physiology and
phenology has helped in understanding the yield formation process under drought
conditions. The overall understanding of TPEs and differential sensitivity of various
growth stages to water stress helped to identify target traits for manipulation through
breeding for drought tolerance. Recent advancement in high-throughput phenotyping
platforms has made it more realistic to screen large populations/germplasm for droughtadaptive
traits. The role of adapted germplasm has been emphasized for drought
breeding, as the measured performance under drought stress is largely an outcome
of adaptation to stress environments. Hybridization of adapted landraces with selected
elite genetic material has been stated to amalgamate adaptation and productivity.

We investigated how adaptations related to FEW vulnerabilities are occurring and what the global community can learn about the interactions across these adaptations. We conducted a global analysis of a data set derived from scientific literature to present the first large scale assessment (n = 1,204) of evidence-based FEW-related climate adaptations. We found that the most frequently reported adaptations to FEW vulnerabilities by continent occurred in Africa (n = 495) and Asia (n = 492). Adaptations targeting food security were more robustly documented than those relevant to water and energy security, suggesting a greater global demand to address food security. Determining statistically significant associations, we found a network of connections between variables characterizing FEW-related adaptations and showed interconnectedness between a variety of natural hazards, exposures, sectors, actors, cross-cutting topics and geographic locations. Connectivity was found between the vulnerabilities food security, water, community sustainability, and response to sea level rise across cities, settlements, and key infrastructure sectors. Additionally, generalized linear regression models revealed potential synergies and tradeoffs among FEW adaptations, such as a necessity to synergistically adapt systems to protect food and water security and tradeoffs when simultaneously addressing exposures of consumption and production vs. poverty. Results from qualitative thematic coding showcased that adaptations documented as targeting multiple exposures are still limited in considering interconnectivity of systems and applying a nexus approach in their responses. These results suggest that adopting a nexus approach to future FEW-related adaptations can have profound benefits in the management of scarce resources and with financial constraints.",10.1029/2021ef002201,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12573,2022-03-31,Earth's Future,2328-4277,Wiley Open Access,10,,food-energy-water; climate change; climate change adaptations,,1-15

However, the production and productivity of the crop are yet to be expounded in Nigeria for economic gains. Therefore, the objective of this study was to present the current opportunities and constraints to sorghum production in Nigeria. A participatory rural appraisal (PRA) study was conducted in three selected sorghum growing zones in northern Nigeria involving 250 farmers. Socio-economic data were collected through surveys and focus group discussions. Sorghum was cultivated mainly by males (80%) who had grade 6-12 level of education (31.3%), with the productive age of 21-45 years (75.7%) and a household family size of below five members (52.3%). Low yielding landrace varieties such as Kaura (37.4%) and Fara-fara (29.3%) were the most widely cultivated types across the study zones due to their good grain quality. The major farmers’ preferred traits from a sorghum variety were high yield, drought tolerance and Striga resistance.

Moreover, in the field, plants are affected by multiple abiotic stresses simultaneously or sequentially. Thus, it is imperative to compare the effects of stress combinations on crop plants relative to individual stresses. This study investigated the differential regulation of physio-biochemical and metabolomics parameters in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) under individual (salt, drought, cold, and heat) and combined stress treatments using multivariate correlation analysis. The results showed that combined heat, salt, and drought stress compounds the stress effect of individual stresses. Combined stresses that included heat had the highest electrolyte leakage and lowest relative water content. Lipid peroxidation and chlorophyll contents did not significantly change under combined stresses. Biochemical parameters, such as free amino acids, polyphenol, starch, and sugars, significantly changed under combined stresses compared to individual stresses. Free amino acids increased under combined stresses that included heat; starch, sugars, and polyphenols increased under combined stresses that included drought; proline concentration increased under combined stresses that included salt. Metabolomics data that were obtained under different individual and combined stresses can be used to identify molecular phenotypes that are involved in the acclimation response of plants under changing abiotic stress conditions. Peanut metabolomics identified 160 metabolites, including amino acids, sugars, sugar alcohols, organic acids, fatty acids, sugar acids, and other organic compounds. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that abiotic stresses significantly affected amino acid, amino sugar, and sugar metabolism. The stress treatments affected the metabolites that were associated with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and urea cycles and associated amino acid biosynthesis pathway intermediates. Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and heatmap analysis identified potential marker metabolites (pinitol, malic acid, and xylopyranose) that were associated with abiotic stress combinations, which could be used in breeding efforts to develop peanut cultivars that are resilient to climate change. The study will also facilitate researchers to explore different stress indicators to identify resistant cultivars for future crop improvement programs.",10.3390/ijms23020660,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12632,2022-01-08,International Journal of Molecular Sciences (TSI),1661-6596,MDPI,23,2,cold; combined stress; drought; groundnut; heat; metabolomics; peanut; salinity,,1-23
Indian agriculture: The route post-CoP 26,"Padhee, A K; Whitbread, A M",ICRISAT (Patancheru),"India’s pledge of Panchamrit (five-fold strategy) to fight climate change, announced during the 26th Conference of the Parties (CoP26) at Glasgow, Scotland, has caught global attention. The country’s new commitments include reaching 500 giga-watt (GW) of non-fossil fuel energy capacity by 2030; producing 50 per cent of energy requirements via renewable energy sources by 2030; a reduction of 1 billion tonnes of carbon by 2030; reducing the carbon emission intensity of the GDP by 45 per cent by 2030; and most importantly, achieving the target of net-zero emissions by 2070.
A basket of agreements was signed by groups of countries during the Glasgow Summit. Here, we focus our discussions on agriculture and food systems and how India should prepare and act to fight the challenge of climate change in light of CoP26.
As many as 26 countries signed the Sustainable Agriculture Policy Action Agenda at the summit to set a course of action to protect food systems and prevent loss of biodiversity against climate change. The countries laid down their commitments with a pledge “to use land sustainably and put protection and restoration of nature at the heart of all”.
India did not sign the agenda as its Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), one of the missions within the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), is already operational to deal with the issue of climate change in the agriculture sector.
At the present inflection point, when the agricultural sector in these countries, and for that matter across the planet, is threatened by the adversities brought by climate change, these initiatives seem to be a good way to reinvigorate efforts to promote and practice sustainable agriculture technologies.
While Indian agriculture is adversely impacted by the vicissitudes of climate change, the sector also is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As per the Third Biennial Update Report submitted by the Government of India in early 2021 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the agriculture sector contributes 14 per cent of the total GHG emissions (energy 75.01 per cent; industrial process and product use 8 per cent; and waste 2.7 per cent, as per 2016 data).
Within the sector, 54.6 per cent of GHG emissions were due to enteric fermentation, followed by 17.5 per cent from rice cultivation, 19.1 per cent from fertiliser applied to agricultural soils, 6.7 per cent from manure management, and 2.2 per cent due to field burning of agricultural residues. Therefore, effective mitigation measures and appropriate adaptation technologies must be taken to reduce GHG emissions from the agriculture sector.
India’s approach has been a balancing act between growth and sustainability in its climate change policies and it is leading the developing nations to place agriculture in the ongoing negotiations. The National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture, as part of National Action Plan on Climate Change for more than a decade now, has focused to make Indian agriculture sustainable, considering likely risks arising from climate variability.
The Indian Council of Agricultural Research and International Agricultural Research Centres of the CGIAR system (a France-headquartered public agricultural innovation network), including International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), have developed climate smart agricultural technologies and approaches to assist the agricultural sector to be less vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change.",https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/climate-change/indian-agriculture-the-route-post-cop-26-81154,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/11954,2022-01,DownToEarth,,DownToEarth,,,climate change; sustainable agriculture,,

therefore, function either as barriers or enablers for reducing risk and vulnerability.

We apply qualitative and
quantitative analyses to assess the contexts where particular tools are used, along with equity implications for groups targeted by the tools, and the tools’ relationships with transformational adaptation indicators such as the depth, scope, and speed of adaptation. We find diverse types of tools documented across sectors and geographic regions. We also identify a mismatch between the tools that consider equity and those that yield more transformational adaptations. Direct regulations, plans, and
capacity building are associated with higher depth and scope of adaptation (thus transformational adaptation), while economic instruments, information provisioning, and networks are not; the latter tools, however, are more likely to target marginalized groups in their design and implementation.

of the respondents have chosen the sowing date and about 60% have chosen crop varieties based on
disseminated WCIS. In the middle of the growing season, about 70% of the respondents used WCIS
to decide on fertilizer application dates. Results also showed that age and level of education, being
trained on WCIS use, membership to farmers’ organizations, owning a radio have a significant effect

Pearl Millet: A Climate-Resilient Nutricereal for Mitigating Hidden Hunger and Provide Nutritional Security,"Satyavathi, C T; Ambawat, S; Khandelwal, V; Srivastava, R K",Indian Council of Agricultural Research - All India Coordinated Research Project on Pearl Millet(Jodhpur); ICRISAT(Patancheru),"Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] is the sixth most important cereal crop after rice, wheat, maize, barley and sorghum. It is widely grown on 30 million ha in the arid and semi-arid tropical regions of Asia and Africa, accounting for almost half of the global millet production. Climate change affects crop production by directly influencing biophysical factors such as plant and animal growth along with the various areas associated with food processing and distribution. Assessment of the effects of global climate changes on agriculture can be helpful to anticipate and adapt farming to maximize the agricultural production more effectively. Pearl millet being a climate-resilient crop is important to minimize the adverse effects of climate change and has the potential to increase income and food security of farming communities in arid regions. Pearl millet has a deep root system and can survive in a wide range of ecological conditions under water scarcity. It has high photosynthetic efficiency with an excellent productivity and growth in low nutrient soil conditions and is less reliant on chemical fertilizers. These attributes have made it a crop of choice for cultivation in arid and semi-arid regions of the world; however, fewer efforts have been made to study the climate-resilient features of pearl millet in comparison to the other major cereals. Several hybrids and varieties of pearl millet were developed during the past 50 years in India by both the public and private sectors. Pearl millet is also nutritionally superior and rich in micronutrients such as iron and zinc and can mitigate malnutrition and hidden hunger. Inclusion of minimum standards for micronutrients—grain iron and zinc content in the cultivar release policy—is the first of its kind step taken in pearl millet anywhere in the world, which can lead toward enhanced food and nutritional security. The availability of high-quality whole-genome sequencing and re-sequencing information of several lines may aid genomic dissection of stress tolerance and provide a good opportunity to further exploit the nutritional and climate-resilient attributes of pearl millet. Hence, more efforts should be put into its genetic enhancement and improvement in inheritance to exploit it in a better way. Thus, pearl millet is the next-generation crop holding the potential of nutritional richness and the climate resilience and efforts must be targeted to develop nutritionally dense hybrids/varieties tolerant to drought using different omics approaches.",10.3389/fpls.2021.659938,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12757,2021-09-13,Frontiers in Plant Science (TSI),1664-462X,Frontiers Media,12,,pearl millet; climate-resilience; drought tolerance; abiotic stress; nutritional security,,1-18

drier, and more variable—contrasting future socio-economic scenarios (Representative
Agricultural Pathways, RAPs) were co-developed with stakeholders to portray a sustainable
development scenario and a rapid economic growth pathway. The unique characteristic
of this application is the integration of a multi-modeling approach with

Results showed that in Nkayi District, Western Zimbabwe, climate change would
threaten most of the farms, and, in particular, those with large cattle herds due to feed
shortages. Adaptation strategies that showed the most promise included diversification
using legume production, soil fertility improvement, and investment in conducive market
environments. The switch to more legumes in the farming systems reduced the vulnerability

In this review, we demonstrate how different normative views on adaptation outcomes, arising from different epistemological and disciplinary entry points, can lead to very different interpretations of adaptation effectiveness. We argue that how effectiveness is framed will significantly impact adaptation implementation and outcomes. This, furthermore, represents a way of exercising influence in adaptation decision-making.

It was found that the largest group among early adopters of millets were people with health problems (28%), it being the single largest reason for consuming millets, followed by those wanting to lose weight (15%) and those selecting millets for its taste (14%). There was a signiﬁcant gap between people who were health conscious (91%) and those who were sure millets were healthy (40%). The major reason the respondents did not eat more millets was that it was not eaten at home (40%), followed by reactions such as not liking the taste (22%).

This paper investigates the impact of climate change adaptations on food security among pastoralists in semi-arid parts of Kenya, who have not received due attention to date. Using an endogenous switching regression model, the current study revealed that pastoralists’ food security increased significantly when they employed measures to adapt to climate change. The study results also showed that wealthier households and those with more livestock were more food-secure than comparatively poorer households or those with less livestock. Furthermore, the study uncovered a high prevalence of food security among more educated households. The paper therefore recommends that, in Kenya’s semi-arid lands, where pastoralism is the primary means of livelihood, policies advocating adaptations to climate change should be strengthened.

Contribution of Climate-Smart Agriculture Technologies to Food Self-Sufficiency of Smallholder Households in Mali,"Traore, B; Zemadim, B; Sangaré, S; Gumma, M K; Tabo, R; Whitbread, A M","ICRISAT (Bamako); AMASSA Afrique Verte, Bamako","Climate change has resulted in food insecurity for the majority of farming communities in
the Sudano-Sahelian zone of Mali. In this paper, we present a methodology for scaling climate-smart
agriculture (CSA) technologies such as Contour Bunding (CB), Microdosing (MD), Intercropping (IC),
Zaï pits, and Adapted crop Variety (AV) treatments, and evaluated their contribution to smallholder
households’ food self-sufficiency. We used the participatory technology selection method and onfarm
demonstration in order to tackle farm-related constraints. The study found that there has been
a major shift in the spatial distribution of land use/land cover (LULC) classes between 2016 and
2020. About 25% of the areas changed from other land use/land cover to cropland. Crop yields
obtained from CSA-treated fields were significantly higher than yields from farmers’ practice (FP).
The application of CSA technologies resulted in millet yield increases by 51%, 35%, and 23% with
contour bunding (CB), microdosing (MD) and intercropping (IC), respectively. With Zaï pits and
adapted variety (AV) treatments, the yield increases were 69% and 27%, respectively. Further, the use
of IC and MD technologies reduced the food-insecure household status to 13%, which corresponds
to a food insecurity reduction of 60%. The application of Zaï technology reversed the negative
status of food-insecurity to +4%, corresponding to a reduction in food insecurity of more than 100%.
In the case of food-secure households, the application of CSA technologies led to increased food
production. However, notwithstanding this, prospects for CSA in the Sahel hinge on the capacities
of farming households and local extension agents to understand the environmental, economic and

were observed in Himayat Sagar (HS) catchment, India. We examined the degree to
which hydrologic changes observed in the HS catchment can be attributed to various

of different causes of change on the hydrologic response. The analysis was
carried out using Modified Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a semidistributed
rainfall-runoff model coupled with a lumped groundwater model for each
sub- catchment. The model results indicated that the decline in potential evapotranspiration
(PET) appears to be partially offset by a significant response to changes in
rainfall. Measures that enhance recharge, such as watershed hydrological structures,
have had limited success in terms of reducing impacts on the catchment-scale water
balance. Groundwater storage has declined at a rate of 5 mm/y due to impact of land
use changes and this was replaced by a net addition of 2 mm/y by hydrological structures.
The impact of land use change on streamflow is an order of magnitude larger
than the impact of hydrological structures and about is 2.5 times higher in terms of
groundwater impact. Model results indicate that both exogenous and endogenous

The resulting crop losses lead to food insecurity and poverty and question the sustainable livelihoods of small farmer communities, particularly in developing countries. In view of this, it is essential to focus and adapt climate-resilient food crops which need lower inputs and produce sustainable yields through various biotic and abiotic stress-tolerant traits. Sorghum, “the camel of cereals”, is one such climate-resilient food crop that is less sensitive to climate change vulnerabilities and also an important staple food in many

Understanding sorghum’s sensitivity to climate change provides scope for improvement of the crop both in terms of quantity and quality and alleviates food and feed security in future climate change scenarios.

Therefore, the way we manage our food systems needs to be urgently changed if the goal is to achieve food security and sustainable development more quickly. This review paper analyzes the nexus “climate-smart agriculture-food systems-sustainable development” in order to draw sound ways that could allow rapid transformation of food systems in the context of climate change pressure. We followed an integrative review approach based on selected concrete example-experiences from ground-implemented projects across Africa (Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, in West Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania in East Africa). Mostly composed of examples from the Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS) Research Program of the CGIAR (former Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) and its partners, these also included ground initiatives from non-CGIAR that could provide demonstrable conditions for a transformative agriculture and food systems. The lessons learnt from the ground implementation of climate-smart agriculture (CSA), in the African context, were instrumental to informing the actions areas of the food-system transformation framework suggested in this paper (reroute, de-risk, reduce, and realign). Selected CSA example-cases to inform these action areas included 24 initiatives across Africa, but with a focus on the following studies for an in-depth analysis: (1) the climate-smart village approach to generate knowledge on climate-smart agriculture (CSA) technologies and practices for their scaling, (2) the use of climate information services (CIS) to better manage climate variability and extremes, and (3) the science–policy interfacing to mainstream CSA into agricultural development policies and plans. The analysis of these examples showed that CSA can contribute driving a rapid change of food systems in Africa through: (1) the implementation of relevant climate-smart technologies and practices to reroute farming and rural livelihoods to new climate-resilient and low-emission trajectories; (2) the development and application of weather and climate information services (WCIS) that support de-risking of livelihoods, farms, and value chains in the face of increasing vagaries of weather and extreme events; (3) the use of climate-smart options that minimize waste of all the natural resources used for growing, processing, packaging, transporting, and marketing food, and therefore mitigating the carbon footprint attached to this food loss and waste; and (4) the realignment of policies and finance that facilitate action in the four proposed action areas through the identification of news ways to mobilize sustainable finance and create innovative financial mechanisms and delivery channels.",10.3390/su13084305,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/12752,2021-04-13,Sustainability,2071-1050,MDPI,13,8,food security; climate-smart technologies; weather and climate information services; loss and waste; sustainable finance; partnership; policies; africa; cgiar,,1-17

ultimately yield during rain-fed depending on production is commonly experienced nowadays in
Mali. Germination and establishment of key crops such as the staple sorghum could be improved
by seed priming. The effects of hydro-priming with different water sources (e.g., distilled, tap, rain,
river, well water) were evaluated respectively for three priming time durations in tepid e.g., at 25C
(4, 8, and 12 h) and by hot water at 70C (in contrast to 10, 20, and 30 min.) in 2014 and 2015. Seed

to non-primed seed treatments, hydro-priming significantly [p = 0.01] improved final germination
percentage, germination rate index, total seedling length, root length, root vigor index, shoot length,
and seedling dry weight. The priming with water from wells and rivers resulted in significant higher
seed germination (85%) and seedling development, compared to the three other sources of water.
Seed germination rate, uniformity, and speed were enhanced by hydro-priming also. It is argued that
hydro-priming is a safe and simple method that effectively improve seed germination and seedling

is a need to accelerate the rate of genetic gains in pearl millet productivity. This review
discusses past strategies and future approaches to accelerate genetic gains to meet
future demand. Pearlmillet breeding in India has historically evolved very comprehensively
from open-pollinated varieties development to hybrid breeding. Availability of stable
cytoplasmic male sterility system with adequate restorers and strategic use of genetic
resources from India and SSA laid the strong foundation of hybrid breeding. Genetic

hybrid breeding for drought-prone areas in SA and SSA. Heterotic grouping of hybrid
parental lines is essential to sustain long-term genetic gains. Time is now ripe for
mainstreaming of the nutritional traits improvement in pearl millet breeding programs.

a result of the adverse effect of climate change and widespread malnutrition, millets have

– a WCIS co-production initiative in Senegal in influencing farmers uptake of weather and climate information
(WCI). WCIS are increasingly gaining importance and widely touted as critical in helping farmers adapt to
climate variability. While there have been various WCIS initiatives producing and translating climate data into
tailored information and knowledge in different parts of the world, there is hardly any rigorous evidence
assessing their effectiveness in improving uptake. In this assessment, we use innovative survey methods and
apply rigorous analytical approaches that control for self-selection bias to establish causal linkages between the
MWG and use of WCIS. Our findings indicate that MWGs are positively associated with farmers’ awareness,
access and uptake of WCI resulting in farm management responses depending on the type of information used.
The presence of MWGs generally increases farmer’s awareness of WCI by 18%, access by 12% and uptake by
10%. Furthermore, use of seasonal forecasts is generally associated with a higher proportion of farmers using
improved seed, fertilizers and manure, but negatively with crop diversification within MWG locations. This
suggests that participatory approaches in the provision of tailored climate information and advisory services can
lead to higher uptake and use among farmers in informing farm management responses for better adaptation to

The game captured farmers’ decision-making for three rainfall scenarios and three levels of market prices. The results showed that variable rainfall had little impact on the levels of teff production or commercialization. The exception was the scenario where rainfall failed in both crop seasons; however, the probability of this scenario was low. If rains failed in the first wet season (Belg) or if rains in the second and main wet season (Meher) were late, farmers maintained teff production by increasing the area planted and the share of teff that received inorganic fertilizer. Resource constraints – particularly shortage of land – limited farmers’ production of teff.

Food production systems need to deliver more with finite land and water resources while
exerting the least negative influence on the ecosystem. The unpredictability of climate change
and consequent changes in pests/pathogens dynamics aggravate the enormity of the challenge.
Crop improvement has made significant contributions towards food security, and breeding
climate-smart cultivars are considered the most sustainable way to accelerate food production.
However, a fundamental change is needed in the conventional breeding framework in order to
respond adequately to the growing food demands. Progress in genomics has provided new
concepts and tools that hold promise to make plant breeding procedures more precise and
efficient. For instance, reference genome assemblies in combination with germplasm sequencing
delineate breeding targets that could contribute to securing future food supply. In this review,
we highlight key breakthroughs in plant genome sequencing and explain how the presence of
these genome resources in combination with gene editing techniques has revolutionized the
procedures of trait discovery and manipulation. Adoption of new approaches such as speed
breeding, genomic selection and haplotype-based breeding could overcome several limitations of
conventional breeding. We advocate that strengthening varietal release and seed distribution
systems will play a more determining role in delivering genetic gains at farmer’s field. A holistic
approach outlined here would be crucial to deliver steady stream of climate-smart crop cultivars

One of the major challenges with climate change is the uncertainty and inter-annual variability in weather conditions as crops are frequently exposed to different weather extremes within the same season. Therefore, agricultural research must strive to develop new crop varieties with inbuilt resilience towards variable weather conditions rather than merely tolerance to individual stresses in a specific situation and/or at a specific crop stage. C4 crops are known for their wider adaptation to range of climatic conditions. However, recent climatic trends and associated variabilities seem to be challenging the threshold limit of wider adaptability of even C4 crops like maize. In collaboration with national programs and private sector partners in the region, CIMMYT-Asia maize program initiated research for development (R4D) projects largely focusing on saving achievable yields across range of variable environments by incorporating reasonable levels of tolerance/resistance to major abiotic and biotic stresses without compromising on grain yields under optimal growing conditions. By integrating novel breeding tools like - genomics, double haploid (DH) technology, precision phenotyping and reducing genotype × environment interaction effects, a new generation of maize germplasm with multiple stress tolerance that can grow well across variable weather conditions were developed. The new maize germplasm were targeted for stress-prone environments where maize is invariability exposed to a range of sub-optimal growing conditions, such as drought, heat, waterlogging and various virulent diseases.

and uncertainty in these low-input systems is currently lacking. We evaluated
the impact of varying [CO2], temperature and rainfall conditions on maize yield, for
different nitrogen (N) inputs (0, 80, 160 kg N/ha) for five environments in SSA, including
cool subhumid Ethiopia, cool semi-arid Rwanda, hot subhumid Ghana and
hot semi-arid Mali and Benin using an ensemble of 25 maize models. Models were
calibrated with measured grain yield, plant biomass, plant N, leaf area index, harvest
index and in-season soil water content from 2-year experiments in each country to
assess their ability to simulate observed yield. Simulated responses to climate change
factors were explored and compared between models. Calibrated models reproduced
measured grain yield variations well with average relative root mean square
error of 26%, although uncertainty in model prediction was substantial (CV = 28%).
Model ensembles gave greater accuracy than any model taken at random. Nitrogen
fertilization controlled the response to variations in [CO2], temperature and rainfall.
Without N fertilizer input, maize (a) benefited less from an increase in atmospheric
[CO2]; (b) was less affected by higher temperature or decreasing rainfall; and (c) was
more affected by increased rainfall because N leaching was more critical. The model
intercomparison revealed that simulation of daily soil N supply and N leaching plays
a crucial role in simulating climate change impacts for low-input systems. Climate
change and N input interactions have strong implications for the design of robust

for enhanced iron content since 2014. This review article focuses on major breeding efforts in SSA to enhance the drought tolerance of OFSP and reviews integrated crop
management practices for improved and sustained sweetpotato production in SSA farming systems. Under climate change, the frequency and severity of droughts is expected to increase. Technical issues are presented in the context of addressing challenges along the entire value chain to ensure adoption. First, the use of an accelerated breeding scheme reduced the breeding cycle from 8–10 to 4–5 years.
Since 2010, 19 drought-tolerant OFSP cultivars have been released in Mozambique, 7 in Malawi, and 2 in South Africa. Moreover, research in four breeding populations
using the heterosis exploiting breeding scheme (HEBS) demonstrated that within one breeding cycle of 5 years, clones with significantly higher root yield, abiotic tolerance, host plant resistance to pests and diseases, and early maturity can be produced. In the future, HEBS will be combined with greater use of modern genomic tools,
new phenotyping tools, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Second, beyond genetic enhancements, evidence is presented that using improved crop management
systems, existing sweet potato yields can be increased 2–4 times. Current knowledge is reviewed concerning sweetpotato’s role in diverse farming systems, but integrated crop management is clearly under researched. Third, the outlook for drought tolerance breeding indicates that two distinct classes of nutrient-rich cultivars are emerging: (1) Early maturing cultivars (< 4 month growing period) that escape drought but also serve humid environments with small landholding size per capita; and (2) Medium maturing (4–6 month growing period) cultivars that avoid drought, are drought tolerant and exhibit

However, much progress remainsto be done if modeling is to effectively contribute to more targeted and impactfulbreeding programs under changing climates. In a period in which CGIAR breedingprograms are undergoing a major modernization process, crop modelers will needto be part of crop improvement teams, with a common understanding of breedingpipelines and model capabilities and limitations, and common data standards and pro-tocols, to ensure they follow and deliver according to clearly defined breeding prod-ucts. This will, in turn, enable more rapid and better-targeted crop modeling activities,thus directly contributing to accelerated and more impactful breeding efforts.",10.1002/csc2.20048,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/11426,2020-03,Crop Science (TSI),0011-183X,Crop Science Society of America,,,crop improvement; breeding; climate change; modeling,,1-21

focuses on women’s greater vulnerability as a result of their reliance on natural resources,
lower access to resources and information, and gender and social norms which inhibit their
ability to take action and participate in making household and community decisions. Less
attention is given to women’s active role as agents of change, their knowledge and capacity to
respond to climate impacts, or tackling of the causes of vulnerability (Dankelman 2010;
MacGregor 2010; Perez et al. 2015; Huyer et al. 2015). In the area of agricultural climate
adaptation, Davidson (2016) noted that research on gender has primarily focused on barriers to
adaptation for women to date, finding that women-headed farming households tend to be more
vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and women in all types of households are
relatively more vulnerable as well.Women farmers are less likely to adopt adaptation strategies
due to financial and resource limitations and less control over land (see Jost et al. 2016; McKinley et al. 2018; Mishra and Pede 2017), while agricultural organizations tend to exclude
female farmers from many of the benefits of extension, including access to information, tools,

Crop modelling can help inform the improvement of agricultural productivity under future climate. This study applies the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator
(APSIM) to assessing the impacts of projected climate change on two (early and medium maturing) sorghum varieties
under different management practices. Results show high model accuracy with excellent agreement between simulated
and observed values for crop phenology and leaf number per plant. The prediction of grain yield and total biomass of
an early maturing variety was fair RMSEn (22.9 and 23.1%), while that of the medium maturing was highly accurate
RMSEn (14.9 and 11.9%). Sensitivity analysis performed by changing the calibrated variables of key plant traits in the
model, showed higher significant yield change by+or - 10 % changed in radiation use efficiency, (RUE), coefficient
extinction (Coeff_ext) and Phyllocron (Phyllo) for early maturing variety while +or - 10 % changed in phyllochron
and RUE showed a significant yield change for the medium maturing variety. Under climate change scenerios using
RCP 8.5, the simulated yield for the early–maturing variety revealed high inter-annual variability and potential yield
loss of 3.3% at Bamako and 1% at Kano in the near-future (2010–2039) compared to baseline (1980–2009). The midcentury
(2040–2069) projected yield decline by 4.8% at Bamako and 6.2% at Kano compared to baseline (1980–2009).
On the contrary, the medium maturing variety indicated significantly yield gain with high yielding potential in both climate regimes compared to the baseline period (1980–2009). The simulated grain yield increased by 7.2% at Bamako and 4.6% at Kano, in the near-future (2010–2039) while in the mid-century (2040–2069) projected yield increase of 12.3% and 2% at Bamako and Kano compared to baseline (1980–2009). Adaptation strategies under climate change for varying sowing dates in the near-future (2010–2039, indicated that June sowing had a higher positive yield gained over July and August sowing for early maturing variety; July sowing simulated positive gained by 5 -11% over June and August sowing for medium maturing variety in both locations. Similarly, under the mid-century (2040–2069), among the sowing dates and in both locations, June sowing indicates lowest negative yield change over July and August sowing for early maturing variety. However, for medium maturing variety, July sowing had the highest yield gain of 16% over June and August sowing at Bamako and June highest positive yield gained of 11.4% over July and August at Kano. Our study has, therefore, demonstrated the capacity of APSIM model as a tool for testing management, plant traits practices and adoption of improved variety for enhancing the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers under

In this study, the response of temperature and rainfall to yield patterns of photoperiod insensitive sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM)
model was evaluated. Following model calibration of the cultivar at varying sowing dates over two growing seasons (2013 and 2014), a long-term simulation was run using historical weather data (1981-2010) to determine the impacts of temperature and rainfall on grain yield, total biomass and water use efficiency at varying nitrogen fertilizer applications. The results showed that model performance was excellent with the lowest mean bias error (MBE) of -2.2 days for flowering and 1.4 days for physiological maturity. Total biomass and grain yield were satisfactorily reproduced, indicating fairly low RMSE values of 21.3% for total biomass and very low RMSE of 11.2 % for grain yield of the observed mean. Simulations at varying Nfertilizer application rate with increased temperature of 2 °C, 4 °C and 6 °C and decreased rainfall by 25 and 50 % (W-25% and W-50%) posed a highly significant risk to low yield compared to increase in rainfall.
However, the magnitude of temperature changes showed a decline in grain yield by 10%, while a decrease in rainfall by W-25% and W-50% resulted in yield decline between 5% and 37%, respectively.

Rice, wheat, and maize are the major staple crops consumed globally. Drought, waterlogging, heat, salinity, and mineral toxicity are the key abiotic stresses drastically affecting crop yield. Conventional plant breeding approaches towards abiotic stress tolerance have gained success to limited extent, due to the complex (multigenic) nature of these stresses. Progress in breeding climate-resilient crop plants has gained momentum in the last decade, due to improved understanding of the physiochemical and molecular basis of various stresses. A good number of genes have been characterized for adaptation to various stresses. In the era of novel molecular markers, mapping of QTLs has emerged as viable solution for breeding crops tolerant to abiotic stresses. Therefore, molecular breeding-based development and deployment of high-yielding climate-resilient crop cultivars together with climate-smart agricultural practices can pave the path to enhanced crop yields for smallholder farmers in areas vulnerable to the climate change.

Therefore, climate anomalies might provide opportunities to identify the relationship of past climate in deriving the distribution of invasive species and to detect their probable future distribution. In this work, we studied the correlation of climate anomaly i.e. temperature and precipitation with an indicative map of plant invasive species (1° grid) of India. The indicative map was generated through the plant data available from the project ‘Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level’. Climate anomaly was calculated and represented by average temperature and precipitation using ‘Climate Research Unit’ data for the period of 1901 to 2000. A comparison of local geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and a global ordinary least square regression (OLS) model was carried out for statistical analysis to depict the correlation at 1° spatial grids. Overall, 20,501 records with a total of 9112 unique plots and 161 unique invasive species were recorded in the database that shows a maximum of 15 invasive species in a 0.04 ha nested quadrat. Cumulative analysis showed a maximum of 53 invasive species at 1° grid. Individually, GWR could reveal a significant correlation with invasive species distribution for temperature anomaly (r2 = 0.73, AIC= 2206) and precipitation anomaly (r2 = 0.74, AIC= 2221), while OLS model did not offer a good correlation (r2 < 0.001, AIC > 2400) compared to GWR. Combination of temperature and precipitation anomaly (shared model) showed an improved spatial correlation (r2 > 0.75) using GWR. Variation partitioning revealed the dominant influence (> 0.40 of variation) of temperature anomaly over Deccan Peninsula, Himalaya and North East zone. Influence of precipitation anomaly was more prominent over arid and semi-arid zone explaining > 0.35 of variation. Results revealed the strength of GWR to see the interaction of invasive plant species w.r.t. climate anomalies that explain the influence of spatial variation due to heterogeneity at varying neighbour distances. The significant correlation of invasive species with both the anomalies revealed the affinity of invasive species towards warmer, drier and wet places. This gives an indication that the distribution of invasive species could be triggered by climate anomaly.

Section 2 considers changes in contexts: Where are agricultural research investments most likely to be an engine of poverty reduction? Over the past 25 years, there have been profound changes in the development context of most countries, necessitating an update on strategic insights for research investment priorities relevant for the economic, political, social, environmental, and structural realities of the early 21st Century. Section 2 briefly surveys changes in these structural aspects of poverty and development processes in low-income countries, with particular attention to new drivers (e.g., urbanization, climate change) that will be of increasing salience in the coming decades. In Section 3, we turn to mechanisms: What are the plausible impact pathways and what evidence exists to test their plausibility? Poor farmers in the developing world are often the stated focus of public sector agricultural research. However, farmers are not the only potential beneficiaries of agricultural research; rural landless laborers, stakeholders along food value chains, and the urban poor can also be major beneficiaries of such research. Thus, there are multiple, interacting pathways through which agricultural research can contribute to reductions in poverty and associated livelihood vulnerabilities. This paper introduces an ex ante set of 18 plausible impact pathways from agricultural research to rural prosperity outcomes, employing bibliometric methods to assess the evidence underpinning causal links. In Section 4, we revisit the concept of desired impacts: When we seek poverty reduction, what does that mean and what measures are needed to demonstrate impact? The papers in this special issue are intended to yield insights to inform improvements in agricultural research that seeks to reduce poverty. History indicates that equity of distribution of gains matters hugely, and thus the questions of “who wins?” and “who loses?” must be addressed. Moreover, our understanding(s) of “poverty” and the intended outcomes of development investments have become much richer over the past 25 years, incorporating more nuance regarding gender, community differences, and fundamental reconsideration of the meaning of poverty and prosperity that are not captured by simple head count income or even living standard measures.",10.1016/j.agsy.2018.01.002,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/10606,2019-06,Agricultural Systems (TSI),1873-2267,Elsevier,172,,agricultural research for development (ar4d); agri-food systems; development strategy; impact pathways; poverty; poverty reduction; ar4d investments; agricultural research investments; agricultural research impacts; r&d; agricultural innovation; research and development; agricultural research,,1-15

The scaling-up needed to achieve goals of CSA represents a challenge, as it entails understanding synergies between often opposing socioeconomic and environmental priorities and trade-offs over temporal and spatial scales. In this paper, we tested new approaches to support scaling-up of sustainable food production through investigating the contribution of systems thinking as a conceptual approach and complex adaptive system (CAS) attributes as a framework for analysis of CSA. This was done through examining (i) to what extent CSA represents a CAS and (ii) what contribution systems thinking and CAS attributes can make to understanding and scaling-up sustainable food production systems through CSA. The CSA situation was conceptualized through systems thinking sessions with women farmers in the climate-smart village (CSV) of Doggoh-Jirapa, northern Ghana, and was guided by the Distinctions, Systems, Relationships and Perspectives (DSRP) framework. Systems thinking, and CAS attributes provide system-wide understanding of elements, dynamics and trade-offs over temporal and spatial scale in selected agri-food systems. As such it could aid horizontal and vertical scaling-up by informing policy developoment and selection of a context-specific portfolio of technologies and practices at landscape and farm levels to achieve synergies between goals. In this study, systems thinking enabled women farmers in the CSV to identify income-generating and tree planting activities, with desirable simultaneous system-wide impact.

Consistent with an earlier assessment that mutually reinforcing supply-side and demand-side capacity constraints impede the development of effective climate services in Africa, our discussion of strategies for scaling up practices that meet farmers' needs, and opportunities to address long-standing obstacles, is organized around: (a) meeting farmers' climate information needs; (b) supporting access, understanding and use; and (c) co-production of services. A widespread gap between available information and farmers' needs is associated with entrenched seasonal forecast convention and obstacles to using observational data. Scalable innovations for producing more locally relevant historical and forecast climate information for farm decision-making are beginning to be adopted. Structured participatory communication processes help farmers relate complex climate information to their experience, and integrate it into their management decisions. Promising efforts to deliver rural climate services strategically combine communication channels that include participatory processes embedded in existing agricultural advisory systems, and innovations in interactive broadcast media. Efforts to engage farmers in co-production of climate services improve delivery to farmers and dialogue among stakeholders, but often with little impact on the usability of available information. We discuss challenges and options for capturing farmers' evolving demands, and aggregating and incorporating this information into iterative improvements to climate services at a national scale. We find evidence that key weaknesses in the supply and the demand sides of climate services continue to reinforce each other to impede progress toward meeting farmers' needs at scale across Africa. Six recommendations target these weaknesses: (1) change the way seasonal forecasts are produced and presented regionally and nationally, (2) use merged gridded data as a foundation for national climate information products, (3) remove barriers to using historical data as a public good, (4) mobilize those who work on the demand side of climate services as an effective community of practice, (5) collectively assess and improve tools and processes for communicating climate information with rural communities, and (6) build iterative co-production processes into national climate service frameworks.",10.3389/fsufs.2019.00021,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/11139,2019-04,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,2571-581X,Frontiers Media,3,21,climate services partnership; co-production; scaling; climate risk management; climate information; agricultural extension; national meteorological services; climate; sub-saharan africa; climate challenge; farm decisionmaking; climate information products; climate service frameworks; climate services in africa; african farmers; smallholder farmers; climate variability; agricultural climate services; climate change,"Climate Information Services Research Initiative (CISRI); United States Agency for International Development (USAID); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)",1-16

We used the primary data of 157 drought prone rural households of Odisha state in India for analysis. This study employed polychoric principal component analysis to construct an aggregate food security index. An ordered probit model was used to estimate the determinants of food security. The FSI showed that three-fourth of the respondents were facing food security issues with varying degrees. The estimates of ordered probit model indicated that joint family, education, migration and health insurance are key variables that determine food security, whereas drought adversely affected food security of rural households. Overarching strategies are required to effectively address food security issues in the wake of increased drought risk. This study provides an insight for policy makers in India and in similar south Asian countries who must consider food security in the light of drought.",10.1007/s11205-018-1925-0,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/10677,2019-02,Social Indicators Research (TSI),0303-8300,Springer,142,1,food security index; drought; ruralhouseholds; odisha; india for analysis; households; availability; access; exposure; sensitivity; stability; utility; vulnerability; climate change,,363-385

In this study, these two important physiological mechanisms were measured on parental pairs of existing Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) of sorghum mapping populations; both in experiments run in the glasshouse and growth chambers, and outdoors. In controlled environmental conditions, the RIL1, RIL2, RIL6 and RIL8 showed contrasting transpiration response to increasing VPD. The difference in the soil moisture fractions of transpirable soil water threshold where transpiration initiated a decline were high in RIL1, RIL3 and RIL8 respectively. The exploration of the variation of the evapotranspiration response to VPD was also carried out in a high throughput phenotyping facility in which plants were grown similar to field density conditions. Under high VPD conditions, the RIL parental pairs showed usual transpiration peak during the midday period. At this time period, genotypic differences within parental pairs were observed in RIL1, RIL2, RIL6 and RIL8. The donor parent had lower transpiration than the recurrent parents during the midday/high VPD period. Also, we found variation among parental pairs in leaf area normalized with received radiation and measured plant architecture traits. Across studied genotypes, RIL1, RIL2 and RIL8 showed differences in the plant canopy architecture and the transpiration response to an increasing VPD. Collectively, these results open the opportunity to phenotype the RIL progenies of contrasting parents and genetically map the traits controlling plant water use. In turn, this can act as an important genetic resource for identification and incorporation of terminal drought tolerance components in marker-assisted breeding.",10.1007/s40502-019-0432-x,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/11060,2019-01,Indian Journal of Plant Physiology,0019-5502,Springer India,,,transpiration; canopy; radiation; climate change; high throughput phenotyping; sorghum; vapor pressure deficit (vpd); leasyscan; vpd conditions,,1-12

In response, governments and development agencies are encouraging the adoption of ‘climate-smart’ agricultural technologies, such as conservation agriculture (CA). However, there is little rigorous evidence that demonstrates the effect of CA on production or climate resilience, and what evidence exists is hampered by selection bias. Using panel data from Zimbabwe, we test how CA performs during extreme rainfall events - both shortfalls and surpluses. We control for the endogenous adoption decision and find that use of CA in years of average rainfall results in no yield gains, and in some cases yield loses. However, CA is effective in mitigating the negative impacts of deviations in rainfall. We conclude that the lower yields during normal rainfall seasons may be a proximate factor in low uptake of CA.

Impact of adoption of drought-tolerant maize varieties on total maize production in south Eastern Zimbabwe,"Lunduka, R W; Mateva, K I; Magorokosho, C; Manjeru, P","International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) (Harare); ICRISAT (Bulawayo); Department of Agronomy, Midlands State University (MSU) (Gweru)","Drought is a huge limiting factor in maize production, mainly in the rain-fed agriculture of sub-Saharan Africa. In response to this threat, drought-tolerant (DT) maize varieties have been developed with an aim to ensure maize production under mild drought conditions. We conducted a study to assess the impact of smallholder farmers’ adoption of DT maize varieties on total maize production. Data for the study came from a survey of 200 randomly sampled households in two districts of Chiredzi and Chipinge in southeastern Zimbabwe. The study found that 93% of the households were growing improved maize varieties and that 30% of the sampled households were growing DT maize varieties. Total maize yield was 436.5 kg/ha for a household that did not grow DT maize varieties and 680.5 kg/ha for households that grew DT maize varieties. We control for the endogeneity of the DT adoption variable, by using the control function approach to estimate total maize production in a Cobb–Douglas model. The results show that households that grew DT maize varieties had 617 kg/ha more maize than households that did not grow the DT maize varieties. Given that almost all farmers buy their seeds in the market, a change in varieties to DT maize seeds gives an extra income of US$240/ha or more than nine months of food at no additional cost. This has huge implications in curbing food insecurity and simultaneously saving huge amounts of resources at the household and national levels, which are used to buy extra food during the lean season.",10.1080/17565529.2017.1372269,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/11127,2019,Climate and Development (TSI),1756-5529,Taylor & Francis,11,1,africa; drought; drought-tolerant maize; maize production; food security; eastern; sub-saharan africa climate change; food production; zimbabwe; maize varieties; dt maize variety; agricultural policy; households,This work was supported by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) [grant number:OPPGDI39O].,35-46

Who is quitting? An analysis of the dis-adoption of climate smart sorghum varieties in Tanzania,"Simtowe, F; Mausch, K",ICRISAT (Nairobi); CIMMYT (Nairobi),"Purpose – New agricultural technologies are continuously generated and promoted for adoption by farmers
with the expectation that they bring about higher benefits than older technologies. Yet, depending on the
perceived benefits, the user of the technology may choose to stop using it. This paper aims to analyze what
drives farmers to dis-adopt climate smart sorghum varieties in Tanzania.
Design/methodology/approach – The study uses cross-sectional farm household level data collected in
Tanzania from a sample of 767 households. The determinants of dis-adoption are explored using a bivariate
probit with sample selection model.
Findings – The authors find that while farmers switch between different sorghum varieties, most farmers
actually quit sorghum production. Older farmers and those facing biotic stresses such attacks by birds are
more likely to dis-adopt sorghum.
Practical implications – These findings suggest that there is scope for improving and sustaining the
adoption of sorghum varieties in Tanzania once extension services are strengthened. The findings also point
to a well-founded theory on the role ofmarkets in enhancing the overall sustainability of food systems.
Social implications – The study findings have broader implications for understanding the sustainability
of improved technology adoption
Originality/value – Dis-adoption is also positively associated with the lack of access to markets
underscoring the role of markets in enhancing the overall sustainability of technology adoption and food

Any further increase in the occurrence, and extremity of these stresses, either individually or in combination, would severely reduce the crop productivity and food security, globally. Although, they obstruct productivity at all crop growth stages, the extent of damage at reproductive phase of crop growth, mainly the seed filling phase, is critical and causes considerable yield losses. Drought and heat stress substantially affect the seed yields by reducing seed size and number, eventually affecting the commercial trait ‘100 seed weight’ and seed quality. Seed filling is influenced by various metabolic processes occurring in the leaves, especially production and translocation of photoassimilates, importing precursors for biosynthesis of seed reserves, minerals and other functional constituents. These processes are highly sensitive to drought and heat, due to involvement of array of diverse enzymes and transporters, located in the leaves and seeds. We highlight here the findings in various food crops showing how their seed composition is drastically impacted at various cellular levels due to drought and heat stresses, applied separately, or in combination. The combined stresses are extremely detrimental for seed yield and its quality, and thus need more attention. Understanding the precise target sites regulating seed filling events in leaves and seeds, and how they are affected by abiotic stresses, is imperative to enhance the seed quality. It is vital to know the physiological, biochemical and genetic mechanisms, which govern the various seed filling events under stress environments, to devise strategies to improve stress tolerance. Converging modern advances in physiology, biochemistry and biotechnology, especially the “omics” technologies might provide a strong impetus to research on this aspect.

Efforts are needed to understand the future groundwater availability and associated surface flows under business-as-usual management to formulate policy changes to improve water sustainability. We combine measurements with integrated modeling (MIKE SHE/MIKE11) to evaluate the effects of future climate (2040–2069), with and without irrigation expansion, on water levels and flows in an agricultural watershed in low-storage crystalline aquifer region of south India. Demand and supply management changes, including improved efficiency of irrigation water as well as energy uses, were evaluated. Increased future rainfall (7–43%, from 5 Global Climate Models) with no further expansion of irrigation wells increased the groundwater recharge (10–55%); however, most of the recharge moved out of watershed as increased baseflow (17–154%) with a small increase in net recharge (+0.2 mm/year). When increased rainfall was considered with projected increase in irrigation withdrawals, both hydrologic extremes of well drying and flooding were predicted. A 100-year flow event was predicted to be a 5-year event in the future. If irrigation expansion follows the historical trends, earlier and more frequent well drying, a source of farmers' distress in India, was predicted to worsen in the future despite the recharge gains from increased rainfall. Storage and use of excess flows, improved irrigation efficiency with flood to drip conversion in 25% of irrigated area, and reduced energy subsidy (free electricity for 3.5 h compared to 7 h/day; $1 billion savings) provided sufficient water savings to support future expansion in irrigated areas while mitigating well drying as well as flooding.

However, knowledge gaps on what works limit progress. In this paper, we analyzed 34 case studies of science-policy engagement efforts, drawn from six years of agricultural research for development efforts around climate-smart agriculture by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). Based on lessons derived from these case studies, we critically assessed and refined the program theory of the CCAFS program, leading to a revised and improved program theory for science-policy engagement for agriculture research for development under climate change. This program theory offers a pragmatic pathway to enhance credibility, salience and legitimacy of research, which relies on engagement (participatory and demand-driven research processes), evidence (building scientific credibility while adopting an opportunistic and flexible approach) and outreach (effective communication and capacity building).",10.3390/su10082616,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/10825,2018-07-26,Sustainability (TSI),2071-1050,MDPI,10 (8),2616,climate change; agriculture; science-policy interface; science-policy engagement; agricultural research for development; adaptation; mitigation; food security; climate smart agriculture; csa; climate change impacts; science policy; case studies,CGIAR Fund Donors,1-21

Four major QTLs for number of filled pods per plot (FPod), total number of seeds per plot (TS), grain yield per plot (GY) and % pod setting (%PodSet), located in the CaLG05 genomic region, were found to have cumulative phenotypic variation of above 50%. Nineteen pairs of epistatic QTLs showed significant epistatic effect, and non-significant QTL × environment interaction effect, except for harvest index (HI) and biomass (BM). A total of 25 putative candidate genes for heat-stress were identified in the two major genomic regions. This is the first report on QTLs for heat-stress response in chickpea.

This study determined how CIS use by men and women farmers may be influenced by their perceptions about climate change (CC), farm activities, and demography. The study was carried out at the Lawra-Jirapa Districts of the Upper West Region of Ghana where downscaled seasonal forecast information through mobile phone technologies (Esoko platform) had been disseminated to farmers since 2011. Data was collected from semi-structured questionnaire interviews involving 900 farmers (50.2% women and 49.8% men) and four 20-member focus group discussions. The study confirmed 85.2% (representing 767) farmers were aware of climate change and its implications for their agriculture and other livelihood activities. Men and women had similar perceptions about climate change, perceived by the majority as increased strong winds, higher temperatures, increased frequency of drought, increased rainfall variability and increased flooding. Among other factors, it was evident that use of CIS may be influenced by gender. Men were found to be particularly responsive in adopting CIS use for climate risk mitigation. This was attributed to their ability to easily access and use telephone devices compared with women. The study revealed that unlike women, men were able to access more financial resources and had control of household income which allowed them to purchase mobile phones. Women generally accessed their husbands’ mobile phones. Despite differences in access to CIS, the study showed both men and women found it beneficial for strategic farm decision-making such as when to begin land preparation, when to plant, and which crop to select. In addition, both men and women were found to face similar constrains (such as poor network connectivity and limited of training), to accessing and using CIS through the Esoko platform.

There are hundreds of technical options for improving the sustainability of land management and preventing or reversing degradation, but there are many sociocultural, institutional, economic, and policy barriers hindering their adoption at large scale. To tackle this challenge, the Dryland Systems Program of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification convened an expert group to consider barriers and incentives to scaling technologies, processes, policies, or institutional arrangements. The group reviewed existing frameworks for scaling sustainable land management (SLM) interventions across a range of contexts and identified eight critical actions for success: (a) plan iteratively; (b) consistently fund; (c) select SLM options for scaling based on best available evidence; (d) identify and engage with stakeholders at all scales; (e) build capacity for scaling; (f) foster institutional leadership and policy change to support scaling; (g) achieve early benefits and incentives for as many stakeholders as possible; and (h) monitor, evaluate, and communicate. Incentives for scaling were identified for the private sector, farmers and their communities, and policy makers.

It was evident from the literature that West Africa is vulnerable to climate change and variability, on account of its socio-economic and physical characteristics. As climate change and variability persists, the region's quest to use agriculture as the mainstream opportunity to deliver on set targets of the sustainable development goals will be strongly challenged without appropriate interventions. Adopting CSA seems to be a suitable strategy to achieving food security while also mitigating and adapting to climate-related risks. Among numerous CSA technologies, the review found (1) agroforestry (farmer-managed natural regenerations), soil and water conservation technologies (zai, half-moon, tie/contour ridges, conservation agriculture) and (3) climate information services as highly valued promising options for climate change adaptation and risk management in West Africa. In addition, institutional settings at the community, national and regional levels such as the establishment of multi-stakeholder innovation platforms, national science policy dialogue platforms on CSA in parts of West Africa and the formulation of the West Africa CSA Alliance were found to be crucial in promoting capacity development and awareness of CSA technologies and innovations in the region. The review found that CSA still faces a number of challenges, including: lack of clear conceptual understanding, limited enabling policy and financing. The prospects of CSA in West Africa hinge on the capacities of farming households and the region's national institutions to understand the environmental, economic and social challenges in the context of climate change, and consequently self-mobilize to develop and implement responsive policies at appropriate scales.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.199,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/10690,2018-06-20,Journal of Cleaner Production (TSI),9596526,Elsevier,187,,climate information services; soil & water conservation; agroforestry; policies; institutions; climate smart agriculture; climate variability; west africa; conservation agriculture; agricultural innovations; farming households; climate change; climate information; planting pits; erosion control techniques; drip irrigation; agro-ecological regions,,285-295

While the CSA concept encompasses three pillars (productivity, adaptation, and mitigation), the literature has hardly addressed them in an integrated way. The development status of study sites also seems to influence which pillars are promoted. Mitigation was predominantly addressed in high-income countries, while productivity and adaptation were priorities for middle and low-income countries. Interest in institutional aspects has been gradual in the CSA literature. It has largely focused on knowledge infrastructure, market structure, and hard institutional aspects. There has been less attention to understand whether investments in physical infrastructure and actors’ interaction, or how historical, political, and social context may influence the uptake of CSA options.

The review provides substantial information suggesting that without appropriate interventions, climate change and variability will affect agricultural yields, food security and add to the presently unaceptable levels of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa.

Farmers perceived the projected climate to have negative effects on their livelihoods and there were no outstanding differences in the nature of responses across the three categories of farmers. Farmers’ responses showed that they were concerned about crop and livestock productivity as well as availability of water resources, food and nutrition security and about their general well-being. The intermediate wealth group, which had more than half of its members above 70 years of age provided the least number of ideas for adaptations. Farmers also suggested how they could possibly counteract some of the predicted negative effects or maximize on positive effects.

The extent to which developing countries contribute to GHG emissions is not well known. This study reports findings on the effects of different land-use systems on GHG emissions (CO2 in this case) from two locations in the southern zone of Ghana, West Africa. Site one (located at Kpong) contained a heavy clay soil while site two (located at Legon) contained a light-textured sandy soil. Land-use systems include cattle kraals, natural forests, cultivated maize fields, and rice paddy fields at site one, and natural forest, woodlots, and cultivated soya bean fields at site two. CO2 emissions were measured using the gas entrapment method (PVC chambers). Trapping solutions were changed every 12–48 h and measurement lasted 9 to 15 days depending on the site. We found that, for the same land-use, CO2 emissions were higher on the clay soil (Kpong) than the sandy soil (Legon). In the clay soil environment, the highest average CO2 emission was observed from the cattle kraal (256.7 mg·m−2·h−1), followed by the forest (146.0 mg·m−2·h−1) and rice paddy (140.6 mg·m−2·h−1) field.

Several factors influenced CO2 emissions from the different land-use systems. These include the inherent properties of the soils such as texture, temperature, and moisture content, which influenced CO2 production through their effect on soil microbial activity and root respiration.

Moench), a C4 annual grass, known by the terminologies ‘sugarcane of the desert’ and ‘camel among crops’ for its hardy, drought characteristics. It can be grown in tropical, subtropical, temperate and semi-arid regions and also in marginal soils. It has many salient features such as rapid growth, high sugar content (10–15%), higher biomass, wider adaptability to harsh agro-climatic conditions and metal absorbing property. Sweet sorghum is a variety of S. bicolor generally cultivated for syrup and also forage and feed. It has sweet juicy stalks and higher sugar levels (fructose, glucose and sucrose) than grain sorghum. Sweet sorghum is an efficient biofuel feedstock in terms of water use efficiency, radiation use efficiency and can be used for food, feed, fodder, fuel, fibre and bio-products development. So, it can serve as a candidate feedstock for improving bio-economy via bio-ethanol ‘sweet fuel’ production and also a wide array of co-product generation. Of late, phytoremediation potential of sweet sorghum is also been explored. Further, many consider it as a resilient and model bioenergy feedstock that has wider adaptation and also a climate change ready smart crop without significant trade-offs on food cycle. In the past, commercial-scale plantations and processing, both on primary and secondary processing, have been reported. The research articles, specialized reviews on different aspects of sweet sorghum value chain with an emphasis on bio-product development, and success stories of global importance published in the journal “Sugar Tech” will be really imperative and valuable in redefining the R&D needs of the biofuel producing countries. This special issue entitled “NOVEL PATHWAYS OF SWEET SORGHUM UTILIZATION AND BIO-PRODUCTS DEVELOPMENT” is intended to solicit high-quality, original research contributions on different aspects of sweet sorghum—genetics, breeding, hybrids, physiology, microbiology, biotechnology, production, processing, conversion, utilization and bio-products—so as to provide an authoritative scientific backdrop for informed discussion and debates on sweet sorghum and also share our vision for a scientifically driven growth of sweet sorghum-based industries around the globe, albeit current lower global crude oil prices subdued biofuel industry growth.

Intercropping is often practiced by farmers in semi-arid regions and is perceived as a risk reducing practice. However, there is little knowledge of how and to what extent it can be a viable option under future conditions. As testing a complex adaptation strategy in controlled environments is difficult, conducting field experiments in the dry season offers opportunities to test cropping systems under extreme but real-world conditions. Consequently, a field trial was run in semi-arid India over a two-year period (2015 and 2016) in the dry and hot (summer) season. These trials were set up as a split-split-plot experiment with four replicates to assess the performance of simultaneously sown sole versus intercropped stands of pearl millet and cowpea, with two densities (30 cm and 60 cm spacing between rows - both with 10 cm spacing within rows), and three water treatments (severe stress, partial stress, and well-watered) applied with drip irrigation. Results showed that intercropping pearl millet led to a significantly lower total grain yield in comparison to the sole equivalent. Pearl millet’s highest yields were 1350 kg ha−1 when intercropped and 2970 kg ha−1 when grown as a sole crop; for cowpea, 990 kg ha−1 when intercropped, and 1150 kg ha−1 as a sole crop. Interestingly, even when maximum daily temperatures reached up to 42.2 °C (on Julian day 112 in 2016), well-watered, pearl millet produced reasonable yields. Cowpea yields were often lower than 1000 kg ha−1. Only under the highest irrigation treatment (well-watered) sole cropped, low density were yields of 1150 and 1110 kg ha−1 achieved in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We conclude that successful intercropping systems must be highly specific to conditions and demands. More research would be needed to identify suitable cowpea genotypes and planting densities that could allow for higher intercropped pearl millet yields.",10.1016/j.fcr.2017.12.014,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/10388,2018-03,Field Crops Research (TSI),3784290,Elsevier,217,,adaptation; high temperatures; intercropping; vigna unguiculata; pennisetum glaucum; pearl millet; cowpea; climate change,,150-166

How does institutional embeddedness shape innovation platforms? A diagnostic study of three districts in the Upper West Region of Ghana,"Totin, E; Roncoli, C; Traore, P C S; Somda, J; Zougmore, R B","ICRISAT (Bamako); Université Nationale d’Agriculture du Benin (Kétou); Emory University, Department of Anthropology (Atlanta); International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Central and West Africa Program (PACO) (Burkina Faso)","Innovation platforms have emerged as a way of enhancing the resilience of agricultural and food systems in the face of environmental change. Consequently, a great deal of theoretical reflection and empirical research have been devoted to the goal of understanding the factors that enhance and constrain their functionality. In this article, we further examine this enquiry by applying the concept of institutional embeddedness, understood as encompassing elements of platform design, structure, and functions as well as aspects of the broader historical, political, and social context to which platforms are connected. We present a case study of sub-national platforms established in three districts of the climatically-stressed Upper West Region of Ghana and charged with facilitating climate change responses at the local level and channelling community priorities into national climate change policy. A different kind of organization − the traditional chief council, the agricultural extension service, and a local NGO − was chosen by members to convene and coordinate the platform in each district. We examine platform members’ accounts of the platform formation and selection of facilitating agent, their vision for platform roles, and their understandings of platform agenda and impacts. We analyse these narratives through the lens of institutional embeddedness, as expressed mostly, but not solely, by the choice of facilitating agents. We illustrate how the organizational position − and related vested interests − of facilitating agents contribute to shaping platform agendas, functions, and outcomes. This process hinges on the deployment of legitimacy claims, which may appeal to cultural tradition, technical expertise, community engagement, and dominant scientific narratives on climate change. Iinstitutional embeddedness is thereby shown to be a critical aspect of agency in multi-actor processes, contributing to framing local understandings of the climate change and to channelling collective efforts towards select response strategies. In conclusion, we stress that the institutional identity of facilitating agents and their relationship to members of the platform and to powerholders in the broader context provides a useful diagnostic lens to analyse the processes that shape the platform’s ability to achieve its goals.",10.1016/j.njas.2017.07.002,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/10105,2018-03,NJAS - Wageningen Journal of Life Sciences (TSI),15735214,Elsevier,84,,innovation platforms; institutions; stakeholders; climate change; food security; west africa; agricultural and food systems,,27-40

Globally, the demand for food legumes is increasing as they complement cereals in protein requirements and possess a high percentage of digestible protein. Climate change has enhanced the frequency and intensity of drought stress that is posing serious production constraints, especially in rainfed regions where most legumes are produced. Genetic improvement of legumes, like other crops, is mostly based on pedigree and performance-based selection over the last half century. For achieving faster genetic gains in legumes in rainfed conditions, this review article proposes the integration of modern genomics approaches, high throughput phenomics and simulation modelling as support for crop improvement that leads to improved varieties that perform with appropriate agronomy. Selection intensity, generation interval and improved operational efficiencies in breeding are expected to further enhance the genetic gain in experiment plots. Improved seed access to farmers, combined with appropriate agronomic packages in farmers’ fields, will deliver higher genetic gains.

In order to meet the food demand of the growing world population, a faster rate of genetic gains leading to productivity enhancement for major crops is required. Grain legumes are an essential commodity in optimal human diets and animal feed because of their unique nutritional composition. Currently, limited water is a major constraint in grain legume production. Root system architecture (RSA) is an important developmental and agronomic trait, which plays vital roles in plant adaptation and productivity under water-limited environments. A deep and proliferative root system helps extract sufficient water and nutrients under these stress conditions. The integrated genetics and genomics approach to dissect molecular processes from genome to phenome is key to achieve increased water capture and use efficiency through developing better root systems. Success in crop improvement under drought depends on discovery and utilization of genetic variations existing in the germplasm.

In this assessment, a critical consideration is the impact on crop yields and yield variability in regions currently challenged by food insecurity. The current study assessed impacts of 1.5 °C versus 2.0 °C on yields of maize, pearl millet and sorghum in the West African Sudan Savanna using two crop models that were calibrated with common varieties from experiments in the region with management reflecting a range of typical sowing windows. As sustainable intensification is promoted in the region for improving food security, simulations were conducted for both current fertilizer use and for an intensification case (fertility not limiting). With current fertilizer use, results indicated 2% units higher losses for maize and sorghum with 2.0 °C compared to 1.5 °C warming, with no change in millet yields for either scenario. In the intensification case, yield losses due to climate change were larger than with current fertilizer levels. However, despite the larger losses, yields were always two to three times higher with intensification, irrespective of the warming scenario.

However, there is lack of site-specific allometric equations for the estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB), which consequently limits our understanding of the contributions of restoration efforts in mitigating climate change. This study was conducted in northwestern Ethiopia to develop a multi-species allometric equation and investigate the spatial and temporal variation of C-stocks following the restoration of degraded landscapes. We harvested and weighed 84 trees from eleven dominant species from six grazing exclosures and adjacent communal grazing land. We observed that AGB correlates significantly with diameter at stump height D 30 (R 2 = 0.78; P < 0.01), and tree height H (R 2 = 0.41, P < 0.05). Our best model, which includes D 30 and H as predictors explained 82% of the variations in AGB. This model produced the lowest bias with narrow ranges of errors across different diameter classes. Estimated C-stock showed a significant positive correlation with stem density (R 2 = 0.80, P < 0.01) and basal area (R 2 = 0.84, P < 0.01). At the watershed level, the mean C-stock was 3.8 (±0.5) Mg C ha−1. Plot-level C-stocks varied between 0.1 and 13.7 Mg C ha−1.

It coincided with the worst rice production anomaly recorded by FAOSTAT from 1961 to 2014. In that year, freshwater limitation was blamed as responsible for the yield losses in the southeastern coastal regions. Given the important implication for local food security and international market stability, we here investigate the specific mechanisms behind the effects of this extreme meteorological drought on rice yield at the national and regional levels. To this purpose, we integrate output from the hydrological model, surface, and satellite observations for the different rice cropping cycles into state-of-the-art and novel climate indicators. In particular, we adopt the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) as an indicator of drought due to the local surface water balance anomalies (i.e., precipitation and evapotranspiration). We propose a new indicator of the renewable surface freshwater availability due to non-local sources, i.e., the standardized river discharge index (SDI) based on the anomalies of modelled river discharge data. We compare these indicators to the soil moisture observations retrieved from satellites. We link all diagnostics to the recorded yields at the national and regional level, quantifying the long-term correlations and the best match of the 2002 anomaly.

Climate change has induced an increase in rainfall variability which in turn has affected the availability of water resources, ecosystem services and agricultural production. To adapt to the increased aridity, farmers have used indigenous and modern coping strategies such as soil and water conservation techniques, the use of drought-tolerant crops and varieties, crop diversification, etc., and lately, climate information services (CIS). The latter, according to the discourses, has positively contributed to suitable decision-making in terms of farming, pastoral and fishing management systems. However, the scientific documentation of the engagement approaches, the uptake of the CIS and the ways the delivered information is being used, as well as feedback from the users, is lacking. Additionally, in most of the cases where CIS are introduced, the disconnect between the users and producers of the CIS seems to undercut large-scale uptake. The objective of this paper is to examine the approach used to involve stakeholders in the CIS uptake process in Senegal. We analyzed the experiences and lessons learnt in the country where various CIS products were introduced using participatory methods (stakeholder consultations, interviews, field demonstrations, training workshops, etc.) and innovative stressors (SMS, voice messages, radios, mobile applications, etc.) to effectively involve producers, technicians and policy-makers.

However, limited empirical evidence is available to prove these assumptions. This study aimed to contribute to this knowledge gap. It evaluates whether these outcomes had resulted from the scenario planning exercise and the extent to which they can contribute to transformational processes. The research focused on a district level case study in rural Mali which examined food security and necessary policy changes in the context of climate change. The analyses of interviews with 26 participants carried out 12 months after the workshop suggested positive changes in learning and networking, but only limited influence on systems understanding. There was limited change in practice, but the reported changes occurred at the individual level, and no policy outcomes were evident. However, by building the adaptive capacity of participants, the scenario process had laid the foundation for ongoing collective action, and potential institutional and policy transformation. We conclude that to enhance the resilience of agricultural and food systems under climate change, participatory scenario processes require a broader range of cross-scale actors’ engagement to support transformational changes.

Yet, a limited number of studies also suggest that several adaptation measures may mitigate the effects of climate change induced yield loss. In this paper, we used AquaCrop, a process-based model developed by the FAO (The Food and Agriculture Organization, Rome, Italy), to quantify the risk of climate change on several key cereal crops in the Niger Basin. The crops analyzed include maize, millet, and sorghum under rain fed cultivation systems in various agro-ecological zones within the Niger Basin. We also investigated several adaptation strategies, including changes in the sowing dates, soil nutrient status, and cultivar. Future climate change is estimated using nine ensemble bias-corrected climate model projection results under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (RCP—Representative Concentration Pathway) emissions scenario at mid future time period, 2021/25–2050. The results show that on average, temperature had a larger effect on crop yields so that the increase in precipitation could still be a net loss of crop yield. Our simulated results showed that climate change effects on maize and sorghum yield would be mostly positive (2% to 6% increase) in the Southern Guinea savanna zone while at the Northern Guinea savanna zone it is mostly negative (2% to 20% decrease). The results show that at the Sahelian zone the projected changes in temperature and precipitation have little to no impact on millet yield for the future time period, 2021/25–2050. In all agro-ecological zones, increasing soil fertility from poor fertility to moderate, near optimal and optimal level significantly reversed the negative yield change respectively by over 20%, 70% and 180% for moderate fertility, near optimal fertility, and optimal fertility. Thus, management or adaptation factors, such as soil fertility, had a much larger effect on crop yield than the climatic change factors.

Effects of climate change and adaptation on the livestock component of mixed farming systems: A modelling study from semi-arid Zimbabwe,"Descheemaeker, K; Zijlstra, M; Masikati, P; Crespo, O; Homann-Kee Tui, S","Plant Production Systems, Wageningen University (Wageningen); World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) (Lusaka); Climate System Analysis Group, Environmental and Geographical Science Dept., University of Cape Town (Rondebosch); ICRISAT (Bulawayo)","Large uncertainties about the impacts of climate change and adaptation options on the livestock component of heterogeneous African farming systems hamper tailored decision making towards climate-smart agriculture. This study addressed this knowledge gap through the development and use of a dynamic modelling framework integrating climate, crop, pasture and livestock models. The framework was applied to a population of 91 farms located in semi-arid Zimbabwe to assess effects on livestock production resulting from climate change and management interventions. Climate scenarios representing relative “cool-wet”, “hot-dry” and “middle” conditions by mid-century (2040–2070) for two representative concentration pathways were compared with the baseline climate. On-farm fodder resources and rangeland grass production were simulated with the crop model APSIM and the pasture model GRASP respectively. The simulated fodder availability was used in the livestock model LIVSIM to generate various production indicators including milk, offtake, mortality, manure, and net revenue. We investigated the effects of two adaptation packages targeting soil fertility management and crop diversification and quantified the sensitivity to climate change of both current and improved systems. Livestock productivity was constrained by dry-season feed gaps, which were particularly severe for crude protein and caused by the reliance on rangeland grazing and crop residues, both of low quality in the dry season. Effects on grass and stover production depended on the climate scenario and the crop, but year-to-year variation generally increased. Relative changes in livestock net revenue compared to the baseline climate varied from a 6% increase to a 43% decrease, and the proportion of farmers negatively affected varied from 20% to 100%, depending on the climate scenario. Adverse effects of climate change on average livestock production usually coincided with increased year-to-year variability and risk. Farms with larger stocking density faced more severe feed gaps and were more sensitive to climate change than less densely stocked farms. The first adaptation package resulted in increased stover production and a small increase in livestock productivity. The inclusion of grain and forage legumes with the second package increased milk productivity and net revenues more profoundly by 30%. This was attributed to the alleviation of dry-season feed gaps, which also reduced the sensitivity to climate change compared to the current system.

Maintaining agricultural growth while minimizing climate shocks is crucial to building a resilient food production system and meeting developmental goals in vulnerable countries. Experts have proposed several technological, institutional, and policy interventions to help farmers adapt to current and future weather variability and to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents the climate-smart village (CSV) approach as a means of performing agricultural research for development that robustly tests technological and institutional options for dealing with climatic variability and climate change in agriculture using participatory methods. It aims to scale up and scale out the appropriate options and draw out lessons for policy makers from local to global levels. The approach incorporates evaluation of climate-smart technologies, practices, services, and processes relevant to local climatic risk management and identifies opportunities for maximizing adaptation gains from synergies across different interventions and recognizing potential maladaptation and trade-offs. It ensures that these are aligned with local knowledge and link into development plans. This paper describes early results in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to illustrate different examples of the CSV approach in diverse agroecological settings. Results from initial studies indicate that the CSV approach has a high potential for scaling out promising climate-smart agricultural technologies, practices, and services. Climate analog studies indicate that the lessons learned at the CSV sites would be relevant to adaptation planning in a large part of global agricultural land even under scenarios of climate change.

Candidate fodder trees and shrubs for sustainable ruminant production in northern Ghana,"Avornyo, F K; Zougmore, R B; Partey, S T; Tengan, K","Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Animal Research Institute (Tamale); ICRISAT (Bamako)","A survey was done to document preferred browse plants and farmers’ knowledge about them for sustainable ruminant production in northern Ghana. The study was done in Jirapa and Lawra Districts of Upper West Region of Ghana. A questionnaire was used to interview 50 farmers per district. Tables and graphs were drawn to summarize results.

Ruminant production was a predominantly male occupation (p=0.032). It was also in the domain of the lowly educated (p=0.003). Ninety-seven percent (97%) of the respondents had goats with about half of them having sheep and 17% owning cattle. The overriding (99%) reason for rearing ruminants was to serve as a source of income. In the dry season, ruminants were kept on free range. In the wet season, small ruminants were tethered with or without feed supplementation. A total of 34 browse plants were identified and the most frequently browsed were Fadherbia albida, Ficus sycomorus gnaphalocarpa, Afzelia africana, Pterocarpus erinaceus, Combretum molle and Annona senegalensis. Paramount among the challenges faced by the owners were limited grazing land, feed scarcity and theft. Apart from being fodder sources, the identified browse species were soil improvers, medicinal and human food sources. All respondents grew crops and the most frequently cultivated crops were groundnut, maize, cowpea, bambara groundnuts, sorghum, millet, rice and yam in this decreasing order. Ninety percent (90%) of the respondents fed crop residue to their animals, with the commonest, groundnut haulm, fed by about 80% of the respondents.

Adoption of appropriate technologies among smallholder farmers in Kenya,"Kalungu, J W; Leal Filho, W","ICRISAT (Nairobi); Applications of Life Sciences, Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (Hamburg)","The adoption of appropriate technologies in small-scale farming is an important response to the effects of climate change and variability, especially in Africa. This study investigates the levels of awareness and adoption of some appropriate technologies at two pairs of sites matched for rainfall, but differing in temperature, in semi-arid and sub-humid regions of Kenya. The pairs were also subsequently matched to form cool and warm regions. The study used participatory methods consisting of 20 focus-group discussions and data from 722 randomly sampled households from the two regions. The descriptive and inferential results show that there was a high level of awareness of appropriate technologies but low rates of adoption in all regions. Even though gender did not influence awareness of the technologies, it had a positive correlation with adoption of the technologies. There was a difference in adoption of between male-headed households and female-headed households at a 1% level of significance. Technology knowledge and use were higher in the semi-arid and warm regions than in the sub-humid and cool regions, with farmer-to-farmer learning being the most prominent source of information. There was a difference in the use of technologies which have a positive impact in regions with high temperatures at a 1% level of significance.

The experiment was conducted in an alpha lattice design with three replications during the summer seasons of 2013 and 2014 (heat stress environments, average temperature 35 °C and above), and post-rainy season of 2013 (non-stress environment, max. temperature below 30 °C). A two-fold variation for number of filled pods (FPod), total number of seeds (TS), harvest index (HI), percent pod setting (%PodSet) and grain yield (GY) was observed in the RILs under stress environments compared to non-stress environment. A yield penalty ranging from 22.26% (summer 2013) to 33.30% (summer 2014) was recorded in stress environments. Seed mass measured as 100-seed weight (HSW) was the least affected (6 and 7% reduction) trait, while %PodSet was the most affected (45.86 and 44.31% reduction) trait by high temperatures. Mixed model analysis of variance revealed a high genotypic coefficient of variation (GCV) (23.29–30.22%), phenotypic coefficient of variation (PCV) (25.69–32.44%) along with high heritability (80.89–86.89%) for FPod, TS, %PodSet and GY across the heat stress environments.

We apply normative climate to a qualitative examination of men’s and women’s assessments of decade-long changes in their decision-making capacity in two village case studies as well as comparatively with 24 village cases from seven sub-Saharan African countries. The case studies reveal how a normative climate is shaped by contextual influences that give rise to social processes where, for instance, changes in decision-making and agricultural opportunities may be perceived as empowering by only men in one village, and only by women in the other village.

Studies have shown that in order to understand food insecurity and identify steps for effective intervention, there is a need to apprehend the food systems and food in/security in a holistic way beyond production alone. Understanding the behavioral aspects of food security is critical in the African context where agriculture, while oriented toward basic subsistence, remains embedded in social system including the social dynamics of households, extended families, and communities. This exploratory work focuses on developing a nuanced understanding of food security and adaptive behaviors to current challenges to food security at the household level with a distinct focus on inter- and intra-family behavioral dynamics in rural, southern Mali. Using mental models methodology, we developed two influence diagrams and a set of sub-models that represent rural households’ mental models of food security under traditional conditions and under conditions of external pressures.

The objectives of this study were to assess impacts of projected climate change on grain yield of chickpea by 2030 s (2020–2049) and 2050 s (2040–2069) and to identify crop management options that increase productivity of the crop. The CROPGRO-chickpea model in DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) was used to assess impacts of projected climate change on chickpea and to identify adaptation options. The crop model was first calibrated and evaluated in the study area for simulating growth, yield and water balance of the soil. The result of the model calibration and evaluation showed that there were close agreement between the simulated and observed values that showed the performance of the model to simulate growth, phenology and yield of chickpea under semi-arid northeastern Ethiopian condition. The calibrated model was used to assess impacts of projected climate changes on chickpea and identify crop management options. The impact of projected climate change was assessed for 2030 s and 2050 s time periods under all the RCPs with and without CO2 fertilization. To identify crop management options, different varieties of chickpea, supplemental irrigation and change in planting dates have been evaluated. The result of climate change impact analysis on chickpea showed that grain yield is predicted to significantly increase both by 2030 s and 2050 s under CO2 fertilization condition across all the RCPs as compared to baseline grain yield (1961–1990). However, simulation without CO2 showed that grain yield will not significantly increase by 2030 s and 2050 s across all the scenarios. Based on the prediction result it can be generalized that chickpea will be benefited from the projected climate changes in northeastern Ethiopia. According to the simulation result application of two supplemental irrigation (flower initiation and pod setting stages) and early sowing significantly (P < 0.05) increase grain yield of chickpea in northeastern Ethiopia under the present and future climate conditions.

The modified CSM-CERES-Pearl millet model was used to assess yield gains by modifying plant traits determining crop maturity duration, potential yield and tolerance to drought and heat in pearl millet cultivars grown at six locations in arid (Hisar, Jodhpur, Bikaner) and semi-arid (Jaipur, Aurangabad and Bijapur) tropical India and two locations in semi-arid tropical West Africa (Sadore in Niamey and Cinzana in Mali). In all the study locations the yields decreased when crop maturity duration was decreased by 10% both in current and future climate conditions; however, 10% increase in crop maturity significantly (p < 0.05) increased yields at Aurangabad and Bijapur, but not at other locations. Increasing yield potential traits by 10% increased yields under both the climate situations in India and West Africa. Drought tolerance imparted the lowest yield gain at Aurangabad (6%), the highest at Sadore (30%) and intermediate at the other locations under current climate. Under climate change the contribution of drought tolerance to the yield of cultivars either increased or decreased depending upon changes in rainfall of the locations. Yield benefits of heat tolerance substantially increased under climate change at most locations, having the greatest effects at Bikaner (17%) in India and Sadore (13%) in West Africa. Aurangabad and Bijapur locations had no yield advantage from heat tolerance due to their low temperature regimes. Thus drought and heat tolerance in pearl millet increased yields under climate change in both the arid and semi-arid tropical climates with greater benefit in relatively hotter environments.

The data is mostly observed station data supplemented by bias-corrected AgMERRA climate data. Changes in annual and Belg (March–May) and Kiremt (June to September) season rainfalls and rainy days have been analysed over the entire Ethiopia. Rainfall is characterized by high temporal variability with coefficient of variation (CV, %) varying from 9 to 30% in the annual, 9 to 69% during the Kiremt season and 15–55% during the Belg season rainfall amounts. Rainfall variability increased disproportionately as the amount of rainfall declined from 700 to 100 mm or less. No significant trend was observed in the annual rainfall amounts over the country, but increasing and decreasing trends were observed in the seasonal rainfall amounts in some areas. A declining trend is also observed in the number of rainy days especially in Oromia, Benishangul-Gumuz and Gambella regions. Trends in seasonal rainfall indicated a general decline in the Belg season and an increase in the Kiremt season rainfall amounts. The increase in rainfall during the main Kiremt season along with the decrease in the number of rainy days leads to an increase in extreme rainfall events over Ethiopia. The trends in the 95th-percentile rainfall events illustrate that the annual extreme rainfall events are increasing over the eastern and south-western parts of Ethiopia covering Oromia and Benishangul-Gumuz regions. During the Belg season, extreme rainfall events are mostly observed over central Ethiopia extending towards the southern part of the country while during the Kiremt season, they are observed over parts of Oromia, (covering Borena, Guji, Bali, west Harerge and east Harerge), Somali, Gambella, southern Tigray and Afar regions. Changes in the intensity of extreme rainfall events are mostly observed over south-eastern parts of Ethiopia extending to the south-west covering Somali and Oromia regions. Similar trends are also observed in the greatest 3-, 5- and 10-day rainfall amounts. Changes in the consecutive dry and wet days showed that consecutive wet days during Belg and Kiremt seasons decreased significantly in many areas in Ethiopia while consecutive dry days increased. The consistency in the trends over large spatial areas confirms the robustness of the trends and serves as a basis for understanding the projected changes in the climate.

Why Promote Improved Fallows as a Climate-Smart Agroforestry Technology in Sub-Saharan Africa?,"Partey, S T; Zougmore, R B; Ouedraogo, M; Thevathasan, N","ICRISAT (Bamako); School of Environmental Sciences, University of Guelph (Guelph)","In the literature, a lot is discussed about how agroforestry can achieve the mitigation, adaptation and productivity goals of climate-smart agriculture (CSA). However, this may be relatively too broad to assess the trade-offs and synergies of how specific agroforestry technologies or practices achieve the three pillars of CSA. Here, we provide an overview of how improved fallows (an agroforestry technology consisting of planting mainly legume tree/shrub species in rotation with cultivated crops) may achieve the goals of climate-smart agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Our review showed that improved fallow systems have real potential to contribute to food security and climate change mitigation and adaptation in SSA. Under proper management, improved fallows can increase maize yields to about 6 t ha−1, which is comparable to conventional maize yields under fertilization. This is attributed to improved soil fertility and nutrient use efficiency. Although data was generally limited, the growing literature showed that improved fallows increased soil carbon sequestration and reduced greenhouse emissions. Further, as a multiple output land use system, improved fallows may increase fodder availability during dry periods and provide substantial biomass for charcoal production. These livelihood options may become important financial safety nets during off seasons or in the event of crop failures. This notwithstanding, the adoption of improved fallows is mainly in Southern and Eastern Africa, where over 20,000 farmers are now using Sesbania sesban, Tephrosia vogelii, and Cajanus cajan in two-year fallows followed by maize rotations. Land tenure issues, lack of social capital, and improved germplasm and accessions of fallow species have been cited as constraints to scaling up. However, development of seed orchards, nursery development, and the willingness of policy makers to create a policy environment that addresses market failures and alleviates disincentives should improve adoption and future scaling up.",10.3390/su9111887,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/10262,2017-10-26,Sustainability,2071-1050,MDPI AG,9,11,agroforestry; climate change; adaptation; mitigation; climate-smart agroforestry; food security; improved fallows; legumes,,1-12

By incorporating multiple perspectives into the structure of a model, we hypothesize that sources of risk can be identified and analyzed more comprehensively compared to traditional ‘expert-driven’ models. However, one of the weaknesses of a participatory modeling process is that it is typically not feasible to involve more than a few dozen people in model creation, and valuable perspectives on sources of risk may therefore be absent. We sought to address this weakness by conducting parallel participatory modeling processes in three countries in West Africa with similar climates and smallholder agricultural systems, but widely differing political and cultural contexts. Stakeholders involved in the agricultural sector in Ghana, Mali, and Nigeria participated in either a scenario planning process or a causal loop diagramming process, in which they were asked about drivers of agricultural productivity and food security, and sources of risk, including climate risk, between the present and mid-century (2035–2050). Participants in all three workshops identified both direct and indirect sources of climate risk, as they interact with other critical drivers of agricultural systems change, such as water availability, political investment in agriculture, and land availability. We conclude that participatory systems methods are a valuable addition to the suite of methodologies for analyzing climate risk and that scientists and policy-makers would do well to consider dynamic interactions between drivers of risk when assessing the resilience of agricultural systems to climate change.",10.1007/s10669-017-9653-6,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/10208,2017-10,Environment Systems and Decisions,2194-5403,Springer,,,participatory modeling; food security; west africa; system dynamics; scenarios; climate risk; agricultural systems; scenario planning; participatory modeling process; climate change,,1-10

The use of climate forecasts had become important in coping with climate risk. This study assessed how farmers apply climate forecast information to manage rice cropping systems. The objective of this study was to identify factors affecting how farmers are using climate forecast information in rice-based cropping system in Jakenan, Central Java. Materials and Methods: The study was based on face-to-face interviews with smallholder farmers, using a semi-structured questionnaire conducted in 4 villages (Ngastorejo, Tlogorejo, Bungasrejo and Sendangsoko) in Jakenan sub-district from December, 2013 to February, 2014. A total of 100 farmers were selected randomly based on a list of farmers available in each village. The response of respondents was then statistically analyzed using the SPSS version 22 and the mean differences were determined by Independent t-test. Results: Results showed that in Jakenan, Central Java, farmers were influenced by several factors such as management practices, knowledge of climate forecasts and the process of decision making for farming practices with regard to the use of climate forecast. Based on the survey, most of respondents had knowledge of climate forecasts (72%) and used them for planting time determination (94%) and selection of crop varieties (91%). Adjusting planting time and selecting proper crop varieties has become their main strategy in coping with climate variability. Conclusion: Based on these results, the level of farmer knowledge mainly affects the use of climate forecast at the farm level in this region.

Analyzing the threats as well as the species vulnerability to them is fundamental for priority setting in conservation planning. Guided by literature and local experts we selected 16 important food tree species (Acacia macrostachya, Acacia senegal, Adansonia digitata, Annona senegalensis, Balanites aegyptiaca, Bombax costatum, Boscia senegalensis, Detarium microcarpum, Lannea microcarpa, Parkia biglobosa, Sclerocarya birrea, Strychnos spinosa, Tamarindus indica, Vitellaria paradoxa, Ximenia americana, Ziziphus mauritiana) and six key threats to them (overexploitation, overgrazing, fire, cotton production, mining and climate change). We developed a species-specific and spatially explicit approach combining freely accessible datasets, species distribution models (SDMs), climate models and expert survey results to predict, at fine scale, where these threats are likely to have the greatest impact. We find that all species face serious threats throughout much of their distribution in Burkina Faso and that climate change is predicted to be the most prevalent threat in the long term, whereas overexploitation and cotton production are the most important short-term threats. Tree populations growing in areas designated as ‘highly threatened’ due to climate change should be used as seed sources for ex situ conservation and planting in areas where future climate is predicting suitable habitats. Assisted regeneration is suggested for populations in areas where suitable habitat under future climate conditions coincides with high threat levels due to short-term threats. In the case of Vitellaria paradoxa, we suggest collecting seed along the northern margins of its distribution and considering assisted regeneration in the central part where the current threat level is high due to overexploitation. In the same way, population-specific recommendations can be derived from the individual and combined threat maps of the other 15 food tree species. The approach can be easily transferred to other countries and can be used to analyze general and species specific threats at finer and more local as well as at broader (continental) scales in order to plan more selective and efficient conservation actions in time.

The degree and causes of vulnerability to flood risk vary by society, geographical region and over time. The rural people of India are highly vulnerable to flood hazards due to high dependence on natural resources for livelihood and poor socio-economic situations. The information regarding the degree of vulnerability of these people is limited. In order to formulate improved adaption policies and effective programmes to reduce vulnerability, it is crucial to quantify the vulnerability of rural households affected by floods at a regional level. Our study provides insight into the vulnerability of rural households affected by floods in India. We use primary data of 220 flood-prone rural households of Odisha state in India for analysis. The vulnerability is analysed using the Livelihood Vulnerability Index and the Socio-economic Vulnerability Index. Our results show that these households are vulnerable to flood in more than one dimension. Sociodemographic characteristics such as a low literacy rate, a high dependency ratio and a weak housing structure increase these residents’ vulnerability. Access to social networks and social institutions plays a significant role in uplifting poor rural households. Our study concludes that the vulnerability of a household is governed by both non-climatic factors and the incidence of floods. The findings of our study may be considered in developing policies and programmes that will reduce the flood risk.

Nitric Oxide (NO) in Plant Heat Stress Tolerance: Current Knowledge and Perspectives,"Santisree, P; Adimulam, S S; Bhatnagar-Mathur, P; Sharma, K K",ICRISAT (Patancheru),"High temperature is one of the biggest abiotic stress challenges for agriculture. While, Nitric oxide (NO) is gaining increasing attention from plant science community due to its involvement in resistance to various plant stress conditions, its implications on heat stress tolerance is still unclear. Several lines of evidence indicate NO as a key signaling molecule in mediating various plant responses such as photosynthesis, oxidative defense, osmolyte accumulation, gene expression, and protein modifications under heat stress. Furthermore, the interactions of NO with other signaling molecules and phytohormones to attain heat tolerance have also been building up in recent years. Nevertheless, deep insights into the functional intermediaries or signal transduction components associated with NO-mediated heat stress signaling are imperative to uncover their involvement in plant hormone induced feed-back regulations, ROS/NO balance, and stress induced gene transcription.

Heat responsive proteome changes reveal molecular mechanisms underlying heat tolerance in chickpea,"Santisree, P; Bhatnagar-Mathur, P; Sharma, K K",ICRISAT (Patancheru),"Understanding the molecular differences in plant genotypes contrasting for heat sensitivity can provide useful insights into the mechanisms that confer heat tolerance in plants. This study focuses on comparative physiological and proteomic analyses of heat-sensitive (ICC16374) and heat-tolerant (JG14) genotypes of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) under heat stress impositions at anthesis. Heat stress reduced leaf water content, chlorophyll content and membrane integrity with a greater impact on the sensitive genotype compared to the tolerant one that had higher total antioxidant capacity and osmolyte accumulation, and consequently less oxidative damage. This study identified a set of 482 heat-responsive proteins in the tolerant genotype using comparative gel-free proteomics. Besides heat shock proteins, proteins such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) 2, ATP synthase, glycosyltransferase, sucrose synthase and late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins were strongly associated with heat tolerance in chickpea. Several crucial proteins were induced by heat exclusively in the heat-tolerant genotype. Comparative proteome profiling and pathway analysis revealed mitigating strategies including, accumulation of osmoprotectants, protected membrane transport, ribosome and secondary metabolite synthesis, activation of antioxidant and defense compounds, amino acid biosynthesis, and hormonal modulation that might play key roles in chickpea heat tolerance.

This on-farm study was conducted to evaluate and identify the most productive, resource-efficient and profitable direct dry-seeded rice (DDSR) cultivars, and DDSR-based cropping systems in the semi-arid region particularly in water-short irrigated rice areas. Farmer participatory field studies were conducted in Raichur District of Karnataka State, India to assess the performance of DDSR cultivars (Samba Mahsuri, Gangavathi Sona and Prasanna) seeded during the rainy season in rotation with dryland crops (chickpea, mustard and green gram) following rice. Among the three rice cultivars, Gangavathi Sona yielded 9% and 15% higher than Samba Mahsuri and Prasanna, respectively. Our study showed that productivity of rice can be improved by using drought resistant and high yielding cultivars with high harvest index, and stable canal water supply at the reproductive stage. Chickpea and green gram yielded better than mustard under minimal soil aeration conditions of zero-tilled and non-puddled fields which indicate that suitable post-rainy season crops for zero-tilled fields must be selected. The study revealed that sowing time, which depends on rainfall pattern and schedule of canal water supply, is among the major factors to be considered in selecting rice cultivars and dryland crops to achieve higher productivity, resource use efficiency and economic returns. Cropping system involving direct dry-seeding of Gangavathi Sona, followed by chickpea achieved higher production efficiency, land and water productivity, and economic returns compared to transplanted rice (TPR) system.

A global meta and mixed model analysis was performed, using a dataset involving 323 on-station and 9 on-farm studies (a total of 3878 paired data), to evaluate the yield, water input, greenhouse gas emissions, and cost and net return with five major tillage/crop establishment options. Shifting from transplanting to direct-seeding was advantageous but the change from conventional to zero or reduced tillage reduced yields. Direct-seeded rice under wet tillage was the best alternative with yield advantages of 1.3–4.7% (p < 0.05) and higher net economic return of 13% (p < 0.05), accompanied by savings of water by 15% (p < 0.05) and a reduction in cost by 2.4–8.8%. Direct-seeding under zero tillage was another potential alternative with high savings in water input and cost of cultivation, with no yield penalty. The alternative practices reduced methane emissions but increased nitrous oxide emissions. Soil texture plays a key role in relative yield advantages, and therefore refinement of the practice to suit a specific agro-ecosystem is needed.",10.1038/s41598-017-09742-9,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/10158,2017-08-24,Scientific Reports,2045-2322,Nature Publishing Group,7,9342,alternative tillage; rice; agro-ecosystem; crop establishment practices; climate change,,1-11

However, much less effort has been made on developing ultra-high-throughput and cost-effective genotyping platforms for applied breeding programs. In this review, we discuss the scientific bottlenecks in existing SNP arrays and GBS technologies and the strategies to develop targeted platforms for crop molecular breeding. We propose that future practical breeding platforms should adopt automated genotyping technologies, either array or sequencing based, target functional polymorphisms underpinning economic traits, and provide desirable prediction accuracy for quantitative traits, with universal applications under wide genetic backgrounds in crops. The development of such platforms faces serious challenges at both the technological level due to cost ineffectiveness, and the knowledge level due to large genotype–phenotype gaps in crop plants. It is expected that such genotyping platforms will be achieved in the next ten years in major crops in consideration of (a) rapid development in gene discovery of important traits, (b) deepened understanding of quantitative traits through new analytical models and population designs, (c) integration of multi-layer -omics data leading to identification of genes and pathways responsible for important breeding traits, and (d) improvement in cost effectiveness of large-scale genotyping.

Climate smart crops for food and nutritional security for semi-arid zones of Zimbabwe,"Jiri, O; Mafongoya, P L; Chivenge, P","School of Agricultural, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of KwaZuluNatal, Scottsville (Pietermaritzburg); University of Zimbabwe, Faculty of Agriculture (Harare); ICRISAT (Bulawayo)","Southern Africa smallholder farmers continue to be the most affected by the challenges
of climate change and variability. The variability of climate demands the use of a
variety of agronomic strategies and crop choices. Traditional drought tolerant cereal

anticipated. However, there are certain crops, originating elsewhere, that could help the
smallholder farmers increase diversity of crops that can be grown in changed climates.
Trials were conducted to test a basket of known and introduced climate smart crops in
the field. The cereal crops tested were maize, sorghum, pearl and finger millet, and
legumes: tepary bean (Phaseolus acutifolias), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), Bambara

fertilizer and rhizobium inoculation on the growth and grain yield of field grown tepary
bean. Both experiments were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three
replications. Due to drought conditions during the growing season, cereal crops could
not produce grain yield, as there was no grain filling. Despite this, cereal biomass was
5t ha-1 for maize, followed by sorghum (1.3t ha-1) and millet (1.2t ha-1). Legume crops
produced grain with cowpea yielding 568.1kg ha-1 of grain, followed by tepary bean
(245.9kg ha-1) and common bean (227kg ha-1). This is important for food, nutrition and
health security of smallholder communities. Tepary bean inoculated with rhizobium
and had fertilizer applied produced higher grain yield than those without fertilizer or
rhizobium inoculant (P£0.05). In conclusion, resource poor farmers, affected by

To use these scenarios as a global context that is relevant for policy guidance at regional and national levels, they have to be connected to an exploration of drivers and challenges informed by regional expertise.

In this paper, we present scenarios for West Africa developed by regional stakeholders and quantified using two global economic models, GLOBIOM and IMPACT, in interaction with stakeholder-generated narratives and scenario trends and SSP assumptions. We present this process as an example of linking comparable scenarios across levels to increase coherence with global contexts, while presenting insights about the future of agriculture and food security under a range of future drivers including climate change.

In these scenarios, strong economic development increases food security and agricultural development. The latter increases crop and livestock productivity leading to an expansion of agricultural area within the region while reducing the land expansion burden elsewhere. In the context of a global economy, West Africa remains a large consumer and producer of a selection of commodities. However, the growth in population coupled with rising incomes leads to increases in the region’s imports. For West Africa, climate change is projected to have negative effects on both crop yields and grassland productivity, and a lack of investment may exacerbate these effects.

Although significant research on erosion mechanisms has been done, there is still little knowledge on C, N and P fluxes across landscapes to the ocean and their controlling factors in subtropical climates. A four-year study quantifying and comparing particulate and dissolved C, N and P from multiple scales (microplot, plot, microcatchment, subcatchment, catchment, sub-basin and basin) was performed in Thukela basin (≈30 000 km2), South Africa. The basin climate was largely subtropical-humid [mean annual precipitation (MAP) > 980 mm yr-1], but temperate (MAP >2000 mm yr-1) on the highlands. Open grassland, cropland and bushland were the major land uses.

The fluxes decreased by 95, 97 and 84%, respectively, from plot to microcatchment outlet; and decreased further in downstream direction by >99% from microcatchment to basin outlet. The hillslope (microplot to microcatchment) fluxes correlated strongly with rainfall parameters. Particulate contributions dominated hillslope fluxes at 73, 81 and 76% of total annual C, N and P, respectively. Although particulate C dominated in the microcatchment-catchment reach (55%), N (54%) and P (69%) were dominated by dissolved forms. The lower basin zone was dominated by dissolved flux contributions at 93, 81 and 78% for C, N and P for the sub-basin outlet. These results suggested spatially varying drivers of C, N and P losses from the landscape to the ocean, via the river network.

"How climate-smart is conservation agriculture (CA)? – its potential to deliver on adaptation, mitigation and productivity on smallholder farms in southern Africa","Thierfelder, C; Chivenge, P; Mupangwa, W; Rosenstock, T S; Lamanna, C; Eyre, J X","CIMMYT (Harare); ICRISAT (Bulawayo); ICRAF (Nairobi); Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, University of Queensland, CIMMYT (Harare)","Climate resilient cropping systems are required to adapt to the increasing threats of climate change projected for Southern Africa and to better manage current climate variability. Conservation agriculture (CA) has been proposed among technologies that are climate-smart. For a cropping system to be labelled “climate-smart” it has to deliver three benefits: a) adapt to the effects of climate and be of increased resilience; b) mitigate climate effects by sequestering carbon (C) and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG); and c) sustainably increase productivity and income. Research on smallholder farms from Southern Africa was analysed to assess if CA can deliver on the three principles of climate-smart agriculture. Results from Southern Africa showed that CA systems have a positive effect on adaptation and productivity, but its mitigation potential lags far behind expectations. CA systems maintain higher infiltration rates and conserve soil moisture, which helps to overcome seasonal dry-spells. Increased productivity and profitability were recorded although a lag period of 2–5 cropping seasons is common until yield benefits become significant. Immediate economic benefits such as reduced labour requirements in some systems will make CA more attractive in the short term to farmers who cannot afford to wait for several seasons until yield benefits accrue. The available data summarizing the effects of CA on soil organic C (SOC) and reductions in greenhouse gases, are often contradictory and depend a great deal on the agro-ecological environment and the available biomass for surface residue retention. There is an urgent need for more research to better quantify the mitigation effects, as the current data are scanty. Possible co-interventions such as improved intercropping/relay cropping systems, agroforestry and other tree-based systems may improve delivery of mitigation benefits and need further exploration.",10.1007/s12571-017-0665-3,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/10078,2017-06,Food Security,1876-4517,Springer,9,3,no-tillage; sustainable intensification; resilience; climate-smart agriculture; climate variability; smallholder farms; southern africa; conservation agriculture; ca; csa technologies; maize; climate mitigation; climate adaptation; agriculture productivity; climate change,,537-560

Difficulties reside on the development and adaptation of adequate strategies to predict insect pests for their timely management to ensure enhanced agricultural production. Several conceptual modelling frameworks have been proposed, and the choice of an approach depends largely on the objective of the model and the availability of data. This paper presents a summary of decades of advances in insect population dynamics, phenology models, distribution and risk mapping. Existing challenges on the modelling of insects are listed; followed by innovations in the field. New approaches include artificial neural networks, cellular automata (CA) coupled with fuzzy logic (FL), fractal, multi-fractal, percolation, synchronization and individual/agent-based approaches. A concept for assessing climate change impacts and providing adaptation options for agricultural pest management independently of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenarios is suggested. A framework for estimating losses and optimizing yields within crop production system is proposed and a summary on modelling the economic impact of pests control is presented. The assessment shows that the majority of known insect modelling approaches are not holistic; they only concentrate on a single component of the system, i.e. the pest, rather than the whole crop production system.

Our study aimed to determine if aspects of CA, namely tillage and mulching with manure and fertiliser application, improved soil mineral N release, plant N uptake and maize yields in cropping systems on poor soils in semi-arid Matobo, Zimbabwe. The experiment, run for three seasons (2012/13–2014/15), was a split-split plot design with three replicates. Tillage (animal-drawn ploughing and ripping) was the main plot treatment and residue application was the sub plot treatment with two levels (100% residues removed or retained after harvest). Five fertility amendments (mineral fertiliser at 0, 20 and 40 kg N ha-1, 5 t ha-1 manure only and 5 t ha-1 manure + 20 kg N ha-1) were sub-sub plot treatments. Plough tillage stimulated N mineralisation by 4–19 kg N ha-1 and maize N uptake 13–23% more than the ripper tillage. When mulch was added to the plough tillage, mineralisation was slowed resulting in less crop N uptake (by 5–19%) compared with no mulch application. N uptake was highest in the manure treatments. N recovery and agronomic N efficiency by maize were highly variable over the three seasons, reflecting the uncertainty complicating farmers’ decision making. Nitrogen recovery in the manure treatments was generally poor in the first season resulting in low grain yields in the range 100–260 kg ha-1 regardless of tillage, though higher in subsequent seasons. In the second season manure application gave the largest grain yields under the ripper tillage, both with and without mulch averaging 1850 and 2228 kg ha-1 respectively. Under the plough tillage, the 40 kg N ha-1 treatment gave the highest grain yields of 1985 kg ha-1. In the third season yields were generally poor under all treatments due to low and poorly-distributed rainfall. The CA principles of minimum soil disturbance and maintenance of a permanent mulch cover resulted in reduced soil mineral N availability for crop uptake and poor maize yields.

Exploring Niches for Short-Season Grain Legumes in Semi-Arid Eastern Kenya — Coping with the Impacts of Climate Variability,"Sennhenn, A; Njarui, D M G; Maass, B L; Whitbread, A M","Tropical Plant Production and Agricultural Systems Modelling, Georg-August University Göttingen (Göttingen); Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (Katumani); ICRISAT (Patancheru)","Climate variability is the major risk to agricultural production in semi-arid agroecosystems and the key challenge to sustain farm livelihoods for the 500 million people who inhabit these areas worldwide. Short-season grain legumes have great potential to address this challenge and help to design more resilient and productive farming systems. However, grain legumes display a great diversity and differ widely in growth, development, and resource use efficiency. Three contrasting short season grain legumes common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] and lablab [Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet] were selected to assess their agricultural potential with respect to climate variability and change along the Machakos-Makueni transect in semi-arid Eastern Kenya. This was undertaken using measured data [a water response trial conducted during 2012/13 and 2013/14 in Machakos, Kenya] and simulated data using the Agricultural Production System sIMulator (APSIM). The APSIM crop model was calibrated and validated to simulate growth and development of short-season grain legumes in semi-arid environments. Water use efficiency (WUE) was used as indicator to quantify the production potential. The major traits of adaptation include early flowering and pod and seed set before the onset of terminal drought. Early phenology together with adapted canopy architecture allowed more optimal water use and greater partitioning of dry matter into seed (higher harvest index). While common bean followed a comparatively conservative strategy of minimizing water loss through crop transpiration, the very short development time and compact growth habit limited grain yield to rarely exceed 1,000 kg ha−1. An advantage of this strategy was relatively stable yields independent of in-crop rainfall or season length across the Machakos-Makueni transect. The growth habit of cowpea in contrast minimized water loss through soil evaporation with rapid ground cover and dry matter production, reaching very high grain yields at high potential sites (3,000 kg ha−1) but being highly susceptible to in-season drought. Lablab seemed to be best adapted to dry environments. Its canopy architecture appeared to be best in compromising between the investment in biomass as a prerequisite to accumulate grain yield by minimizing water loss through soil evaporation and crop transpiration. This lead to grain yields of up to 2,000 kg ha−1 at high potential sites and >1,000 kg ha−1 at low potential sites. The variance of observed and simulated WUE was high and no clear dependency on total rainfall alone was observed for all three short-season grain legumes, highlighting that pattern of water use is also important in determining final WUEbiomass and WUEgrain. Mean WUEgrain was lowest for cowpea (1.5–3.5 kggrain ha−1 mm−1) and highest for lablab (5–7 kggrain ha−1 mm−1) reflecting the high susceptibility to drought of cowpea and the good adaptation to dry environments of lablab. Results highlight that, based on specific morphological, phonological, and physiological characteristics, the three short-season grain legumes follow different strategies to cope with climate variability. The climate-smart site-specific utilization of the three legumes offers promising options to design more resilient and productive farming systems in semi-arid Eastern Kenya.",10.3389/fpls.2017.00699,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/10010,2017-05,Frontiers in Plant Science,1664-462X,Frontiers Media,8,699,grain legumes; kenya; climate variability; climate change,,1-17

Aside from such major crises, plant pathogens should also be seen as important reducers of crop performances, with impacts on system sustainability, from the ecological, agronomical, social, and economic standpoints – all contributing ultimately to affecting food security. These views need reconciliation in order to produce a clearer picture of the multidimensional effects of plant disease epidemics. Such a picture is needed for disease management today, but would also be useful for future policies. This article attempts to develop a framework that would enable assessment of the impacts of plant diseases, referred collectively to as crop health, on food security via its components. We have combined three different existing definitions of food security in order to develop a framework consisting of the following six components: (1) Availability. Primary production; (2) Availability. Import - Stockpiles; (3) Access. Physical and supply chain; (4) Access. Economic; (5) Stability of food availability; (6) Utility-Safety-Quality-Nutritive value. In this framework, components of food security are combined with three attributes of production situations: the nature of the considered crop (i.e. food- or non-food), the structure of farms (i.e. subsistence or commercial), and the structure of markets (i.e. weakly organized and local, to strongly organized and globalized). The resulting matrix: [Food security components] × [Attributes of production situations] provides a framework where the impacts of chronic, acute, and emerging plant disease epidemics on food security can be examined. We propose that, given the number of components and interactions at play, a systems modelling approach is required to address the functioning of food systems exposed to plant disease risks. This approach would have application in both the management of the current attrition of crop performances by plant diseases, and also of possible disease-induced shocks. Such an approach would also enable quantifying shifts in disease vulnerability of production situations, and therefore, of food systems, as a result of climate change, globalization, and evolving crop health.",10.1007/s12571-017-0659-1,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/9975,2017-04,Food Security,1876-4517,Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology,9,2,plant disease epidemics; epidemiology; crop losses; chronic epidemics; acute epidemics; emerging epidemics; plant disease impacts; food security; crop health; global impacts,,311-327

The national economy is vulnerable to climate change due to 50% of the gross domestic product coming from the agricultural sector and 75% of the population living in rural areas. The Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) concept arises from a need to provide innovative solutions towards the complex and integrated goals of increasing yields, improving resilience, and promoting a low emissions agricultural sector. A major challenge for policymakers to operationalize CSA is the identification, valuation (cost-benefit), and subsequent prioritization of climate-smart options and portfolios (groups of CSA options) for investment. This paper presents the process, results, and lessons learned from a yearlong pilot of the Climate-Smart Agriculture Prioritization Framework (CSA-PF) in Mali. Key national and international stakeholders participated in the co-development and prioritization of two CSA portfolios and related action plans for the Malian Sudanese zone.

To contribute to such efforts, this paper analyzes drivers of change in farming practices in the region using data obtained from surveys of 700 farming households in five countries (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Senegal). The results showed that farmers have adopted various practices in response to the challenges they have faced during the last decade. A series of logit models showed that most changes farmers made to their practices are undertaken for multiple reasons. Land use and management changes including expanding farmed areas and using mineral fertilization and manure are positively related to perceived changes in the climate, such as more erratic rainfall. Planting new varieties, introducing new crops, crop rotation, expanding farmed area and using pesticides are positively associated with new market opportunities. Farm practices that require relatively high financial investment such as use of pesticides, drought-tolerant varieties and improved seeds were positively associated with the provision of technical and financial support for farmers through development projects and policies. Changes in markets and climate are both helping to promote needed changes in farming practices in West Africa.

Cultivars for Irrigation-Based Production in Ethiopia,"Girma, N; Fikre, A; Ojiewo, C O",Debre zeit Agricultural Research Center (Debre Zeit); ICRISAT (Addis Ababa),"Development of irrigation-based chickpea production is considered the most important alternative approach in
combating climate change and maximizing productivity, especially in moisture-stress areas and in areas where
water and land for irrigation is available. In central Ethiopia, where production of chickpea (especially Kabuli
type) is becoming an important part of agriculture, although many superior varieties (both desi and Kabuli types)
are available, they have been evaluated and released based on rainfed production. Hence, there is an urgent need
for evaluation of varieties suited for irrigation-based production. Towards this goal, during the 2012/13 growing
season, 14 Kabuli genotypes (previously introduced) and 24 desi genotypes (nurseries obtained from ICRISAT)
were evaluated independently at three and one locations respectively (Kabuli at Debre Zeit, Ambo and Werer;
desi at Debre Zeit) for production adaptation under irrigation. The parameters evaluated were date of maturity,
100-seed weight and yield. Overall, while most Kabuli genotypes showed high adaptability to irrigation-based
production at all locations, four Kabuli genotypes (X96TH-52-14/2000 = 106.7DAS, FLIP-02-39C = 107DAS,

genotype (ICCV-05309 = 3228.8 kg/ha or 32 quintals/ha) out yielded all genotypes across locations. The result
of combined analysis indicated five promising genotypes showing more than 20 kg/ha yield on average. All desi
varieties showed maturity dates of under four months; six genotypes showed higher 100-seed weight and eight

This study aimed to determine factors that increase resilience and cause smallholder farmers to adapt better to climate change and vulnerability.

Design/methodology/approach
In this study, the authors used the vulnerability to resilience model and binary logit model to analyse the factors influencing household decisions to adapt.

Findings
Households with increased access to climate information through extension services were likely to have better adaptation abilities. It was also shown that younger farmers were likely to adapt to climate change given their flexibility to adopt new techniques and their access and use of modern information and technology. Larger households were found to have higher probability of adapting as most adaptation strategies are labour intensive. Household’s possession of livestock and access to credit significantly enhanced adaptation. However, households with higher farm income have lesser incentives to adapt to because their current farming practices might already be optimum.

Research limitations/implications
Given that most of the smallholder farmers are vulnerable, such as women-headed households and the elderly, who are labour constrained, there is need for research and development of labour saving technologies to increase resilience to climate change and vulnerability.

Uses and vulnerability of ligneous species exploited by local population of northern Burkina Faso in their adaptation strategies to changing environments,"Ouedraogo, P; Bationo, B A; Sanou, J; Traore, S; Barry, S; Dayamba, S D; Bayala, J; Ouedraogo, M; Soeters, S; Thiombiano, A","Laboratory of Plant Biology and Ecology, Unit of Training and Research in Life Sciences and Earth, University Ouaga I (Ouagadougou); Institute of Environmental and Agricultural Research (INERA), Forests Productions Department (DPF) (Ouagadougou); World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), West and Central Africa Regional Office - Sahel Node (Bamako); CCAFS/ICRISAT West and Central Africa Regional Office (Bamako); Utrecht University (Utrecht)","Background
Arid and semi-arid areas of West Africa are highly subject to climate change effects. This is combined to other drivers such as population growth and livestock number increase. To cope with such changing environment, endogenous adaptation strategies of poor local communities rely on the use of natural resources through empirical knowledge. Unfortunately, these knowledge and practices are insufficiently known to policy makers, and this hampers their consideration in the elaboration of adaptation strategies. A household survey was conducted in the Sillia village in northern Burkina Faso using semi-structured interviews. This study identified most used (preferred) species in this changing environment together with their ethnobotanical use value (VUET).

Results
Overall, 86 ligneous species were listed in seven (7) use categories: human nutrition, fodder, fuel, traditional medicine, handicraft, construction and trade. From the 86 species, 11 appeared the most preferred by local population (VUET ≥ 6). Except Piliostigma reticulatum and Boscia senegalensis, all these species were part of the 21 very vulnerable species as revealed by the study. Tamarindus indica, Balanites aegyptiaca, Lannea microcarpa and Vitellaria paradoxa are the first most preferred species (VUET ≥ 7) and also most vulnerable (IV > 2.5). In this changing environment, Cassia sieberiana, Combretum micranthum, Balanites aegyptica have, for instance, become the main species used in traditional medicine replacing Ximenia americana, Coclospermum tinctorim, Maytenus senegalensis and Securidaca longepedunculata, formerly used for this need. Also, Piliostigma reticulatum is the main species used in farm lands to combat low soil fertility. Pterocarpus lucens and Adansonia digitata are the main fodder species both during dry and rainy seasons. Apart from the household surveys, vegetation survey was conducted on 96 plots in Sillia. The results showed that 25 species cited in the household surveys had locally disappeared, 22 were rare, 5 were abundant and the others were relatively abundant. Certain collection practices of given species in many use categories increase their vulnerability.

Conclusion
This study documented preferred species in the adaptation strategies to changing environments and also assessed their vulnerability status under human influence; it is therefore of great use for designing sustainable management.",10.1186/s40066-017-0090-z,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/10184,2017,Agriculture & Food Security,2048-7010,BioMed Central,6,15,ligneous species; semi-arid zone; uses; vulnerability; west africa; climate change,,1-16

This paper applies a power-mapping technique, Multilevel Stakeholder Influence Mapping (MSIM), to stakeholders in Ghana's agricultural adaptation policy regime. The method provides a quantitative influence score and visual map for actor groups active-in or affected-by the policy process, from the differentiated perspectives of national, regional, and local-level respondents. MSIM, as applied here, seeks to determine the underlying power structure of the adaptation regime and provides insight in to two key power-laden themes: stakeholder participation and multilevel institutional design. Results indicate that when taken collectively (the views of national, regional and local respondents combined) Ghana's adaptation regime is considered bipolar and elite-centred in its power distribution. A distinguishable ‘adaptation establishment’ or dominant group of power holders made up of technical government and international agencies can be identified. Meanwhile, political groups, the private sector, civil society, and universities are considered to wield substantially less power in the regime. Differentiated perspectives (i.e. national, regional or local respondents alone) reveal that several potential cross-level bridging institutions are not considered influential at all operational levels. Farmers, traditional authorities, and the District Assembly, for example, are all considered highly influential from the perspective of local-level respondents, but their counterpart agencies at the national level are not considered influential by policymakers there. Contrary to the hyper-politicized nature of climate change adaptation at international levels, Ghana's policy regime would benefit from increased participation from political agents, as well as from traditional authorities and farmers. These actor groups can help reverse the a-political nature of the adaptation regime, improve power pluralism across actor groups and levels, and facilitate cross-level cooperation between formal and informal institutions crucial to adaptation success.",10.1080/17565529.2016.1154450,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/10335,2017,Climate and Development,1756-5529,Taylor & Francis,9,5,power; influence; climate change; agriculture; adaptation; policy; ghana; agricultural adaptation; climate change adaptation,,399-414

Here we assessed the farm-level impact of climate change on family food self-sufficiency and evaluated potential adaptation options of crop management. Using three years of experimental data on maize and millet from an area in southern Mali representing the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa we calibrated and tested the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model. Changes in future rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature and their simulated effects on maize and millet yield were analysed for climate change predictions of five Global Circulation Models (GCMs) for the 4.5 Wm−2 and 8.5 Wm−2 radiative forcing scenario (rcp4.5 and rcp8.5).

In southern Mali, annual maximum and minimum temperatures will increase by 2.9 °C and 3.3 °C by the mid-century (2040–2069) as compared with the baseline (1980–2009) under the rcp4.5 and rcp8.5 scenario respectively. Predicted changes in the total seasonal rainfall differed between the GCMs, but on average, seasonal rainfall was predicted not to change. By mid-century maize grain yields were predicted to decrease by 51% and 57% under current farmer’s fertilizer practices in the rcp4.5 and rcp8.5 scenarios respectively. APSIM model predictions indicated that the use of mineral fertilizer at recommended rates cannot fully offset the impact of climate change but can buffer the losses in maize yield up to 46% and 51% of the baseline yield. Millet yield losses were predicted to be less severe under current farmer’s fertilizer practices by mid-century i.e. 7% and 12% in the rcp4.5 and rcp8.5 scenario respectively. Use of mineral fertilizer on millet can offset the predicted yield losses resulting in yield increases under both emission scenarios.

Under future climate and current cropping practices, food availability is expected to reduce for all farm types in southern Mali. However, large and medium-sized farms can still achieve food self–sufficiency if early planting and recommended rates of fertilizer are applied. Small farms, which are already food insecure, will experience a further decrease in food self-sufficiency, with adaptive measures of early planting and fertilizer use unable to help them achieve food self-sufficiency. By taking into account the diversity in farm households that is typical for the region, we illustrated that crop management strategies must be tailored to the capacity and resource endowment of local farmers.

Although the impact of climate change is projected to be large, many uncertainties persist, in particular with respect to impacts on livestock and grazing components, whole-farm dynamics and heterogeneous farm populations. We summarize the current understanding on impacts and vulnerability and highlight key knowledge gaps for the separate system components and the mixed farming systems as a whole. Numerous adaptation and mitigation options exist for crop–livestock systems. We provide an overview by distinguishing risk management, diversification and sustainable intensification strategies, and by focusing on the contribution to the three pillars of climate-smart agriculture. Despite the potential solutions, smallholders face major constraints at various scales, including small farm sizes, the lack of response to the proposed measures and the multi-functionality of the livestock herd. Major institutional barriers include poor access to markets and relevant knowledge, land tenure insecurity and the common property status of most grazing resources. These limit the adoption potential and hence the potential impact on resilience and mitigation. In order to effectively inform decision-making, we therefore call for integrated, system-oriented impact assessments and a realistic consideration of the adoption constraints in smallholder systems.

The objective of this study was to quantify the long-term effects of annual burning on CO2 output from soils and SOC stocks. The study was performed on a 62 years old field trial comparing annual burning (AB) to no burning associated with tree encroachment (NB), and to annual mowing (AM) with all treatments laid out in randomized block design with three replicates per treatment. CO2 emissions from soil were continuously measured over two years and were correlated to soil chemical and physical properties. AB and AM produced 30 and 34% greater CO2 emissions from soil than NB (1.80 ± 0.13 vs. 2.34 ± 0.18 and 2.41 ± 0.17 g C-CO2 m− 2 d− 1 for NB, AB and AM respectively). AB and AM also produced greater CO2 emissions from soil and per gram of soil carbon (1.32 ± 0.1 and 1.35 ± 0.1 mg C-CO2 g C− 1 d− 1, respectively) than NB (1.05 ± 0.07 mg C-CO2 g C− 1 d− 1), which corresponded to significant differences of respectively 26% and 29%. Overall, CO2 emissions from soil (per m2) significantly increased with soil water content (r = 0.72) followed by SOC stocks (r = 0.59), SOC content (r = 0.50), soil bulk density (r = 0.49), soil temperature (r = 0.47), C:N ratio (r = 0.46) and mean weight diameter (r = 0.38).

In response, development agencies are encouraging the adoption of ‘climate-smart’ agricultural techniques, such as Conservation Agriculture (CA). However, little rigorous evidence exists to demonstrates the eﬀect of CA on production or climate resilience, and what evidence there is, is hampered by selection bias. Using panel data from Zimbabwe, we test how CA performs during extreme rainfall events - both shortfalls and surpluses. We control for the endogenous adoption decision and ﬁnd that while CA has little, or if anything, a nega-tive eﬀect on yields during periods of average rainfall, it is eﬀective in mitigating the negative impacts of rainfall shocks. Farmers who practice CA tend to receive higher yields compared to conventional farmers in years of both low and high rainfall. We conclude that the lower yields during normal rainfall seasons may be a proximate factor in low uptake of CA.

However, these forecasts have low utility among farmers in agricultural decision making, unless translated into a more understood portfolio of farm management options. Towards achieving this translation, we developed a mathematical programming model that integrates seasonal climate forecasts to assess ‘what-if?’ crop choice scenarios for famers. We used the Rayapalli village in southern India as a case study. The model maximises expected profitability at village level subject to available resource constraints. The main outputs of the model are the optimal cropping patterns and corresponding agricultural management decisions such as fertiliser, biocide, labour and machinery use. The model is set up to run in two steps. In the first step the initial climate forecast is used to calculate the optimal farm plan and corresponding agricultural management decisions at a village scale. The second step uses a ‘revised forecast’ that is given six weeks later during the growing season. In scenarios where the forecast provides no clear expectation for a dry or wet season the model utilises the total agricultural land available. A significant area is allocated to redgram (pigeon pea) and the rest to maize and paddy rice. In a forecast where a dry season is more probable, cotton is the predominant crop selected. In scenarios where a ‘normal’ season is expected, the model chooses predominantly cotton and maize in addition to paddy rice and redgram. As part of the stakeholder engagement process, we operated the model in an iterative way with participating farmers. For ‘deficient’ rainfall season, farmers were in agreement with the model choice of leaving a large portion of the agriculture land as fallow with only 40 ha (total area 136 ha) of cotton and subsistence paddy rice area. While the model crop choice was redgram in ‘above normal and wet seasons, only a few farmers in the village favoured redgram mainly because of high labour requirements, and the farmers perceptions about risks related to pests and diseases. This highlighted the discrepancy between the optimal cropping pattern, calculated with the model and the farmer's actual decisions which provided useful insights into factors affecting farmer decision making that are not always captured by models. We found that planning for a ‘normal’ season alone is likely to result in losses and opportunity costs and an adaptive climate risk management approach is prudent. In an interactive feedback workshop, majority of participating farmers agreed that their knowledge on the utility and challenges of SCF have highly improved through the participation in this research and most agreed that exposure to the model improved their understanding of the role of SCF in crop choice decisions and that the modelling tool was useful to discuss climate risk in agriculture.",10.1016/j.agsy.2016.09.011,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/9739,2016-11,Agricultural Systems,0308521X,Elsevier B.V.,149,,mathematical programming; probabilistic seasonal forecasts; crop choice; climate risk; small holder farmers; profit maximisation; seasonal climate forecasts; bioeconomic crop choice model; scf; climate change,,175-184

The large demand for palm oil has resulted in a rapid expansion of oil palm cultivation across the globe. Because of the dwindling availability of land in Southeast Asia, most expansion of the industry is expected in Central and South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where land with suitable agro-ecological conditions is available. Using Ghana as a case study, a method for evaluating areas that are both suitable and available for oil palm production is presented. Our assessment used spatial data and GIS techniques, and showed that areas with suitable climatic conditions (annual average water deficit <400 mm) is about 20% greater than was previously identified. The observed differences are the result of using different methods to determine suitability, and climate change. A major climatic factor limiting suitability for oil palm production in Ghana is the annual water deficit, with the most suitable areas located in the rainforest and semi-deciduous forest zones with higher rainfall in southern Ghana. Opportunities for large-scale oil palm plantation development is limited, however, because of the lack of availability of large and contiguous tracts of land that are required for commercial plantation oil palm development. A feasible strategy for oil palm expansion is therefore smallholder production, which can make use of smaller parcels of land. Alternatively, oil palm production in Ghana can be increased by yield intensification on land already planted to oil palm. This can also reduce the requirement for further land clearance for new plantations to meet the growing demand for palm oil. Such assessments will be essential for guiding government policy makers and investors considering investments in oil palm development.",10.1016/j.eja.2016.08.004,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/9728,2016-11,European Journal of Agronomy,11610301,Elsevier B.V.,81,,ghana; oil palm productivity; water deficit; land suitability,,1-14

Rainwater which is harvested using structures of varying types and sizes was used for either supplemental irrigation or recharging open-wells. In many cases, the farm level rainwater harvesting structures were highly effective for rainfed farming and had a multiplier effect on farm income. In some situations however, it was viewed by farmers as a waste of productive land. The use of farm ponds in Maharashtra, for example, resulted in a significant increase in farm productivity (12–72%), cropping intensity and consequently farm income. In the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, farm pond water was profitably used for supplemental irrigation to mango plantations, vegetables or other crops and animal enterprises with net returns estimated to be between US$ 120 and 320 structure−1 annum−1. Despite such examples, the adoption of the farm ponds was low, except in Maharashtra. A functional analysis of the reasons for high adoption of water harvesting structures indicated that factors such as technical support, customized design, level of farmer participation, age, existing ownership of open wells, annual rainfall and household assets were the major determinants of performance of farm-level rainwater harvesting structures.

The Ricardian regression approach was used to examine the economic impacts of climate change based on data generated from a survey conducted in the 2013/2014 farming seasons. Forty-year time-series data of rainfall and temperature from 1974 to 2013, together with cross-sectional data, were used for the empirical analysis. The Ricardian regression estimates for both maize and sorghum showed varying degrees of climate change impacts on net revenues. The results indicated that early season precipitation was beneficial for sorghum, but harmful for maize. However, mid-season precipitation tended to promote maize production. Temperature levels for all seasons impacted negatively on net revenue for both crops, except during the mid-season, when temperature exerted a positive effect on net revenue for sorghum. Our findings suggest that appropriate adaptation strategies should be promoted to reduce the negative impacts of prevailing climate change on cereal crop production.",10.3390/su8080724,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/9727,2016-08-03,Sustainability,2071-1050,MDPI AG,8,8,economic impact; climate change; cereal; ricardian approach; sustainability; cereal production; sustainable agriculture,CCAFS,01-17

The present study was conducted to quantify the impact of sheet erosion on OC losses from soils. Erosion plots with the lengths of 1- and 5-m were installed at different topographic positions along a hillslope in a mountainous South African region. A total of 32 rainfall events from a three years period (November 2010 up to February 2013), were studied and evaluated for runoff (R), particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POCL and DOCL). In comparison to the 0–0·05 m bulk soil, the sediments from the 1-m plots were enriched in OC by a factor 2·6 and those from the 5-m long plots by a factor of 2·2, respectively. These findings suggest a preferential erosion of OC. In addition, total organic carbon losses (TOCL) were incurred mainly in particulate form (~94%) and the increase in TOCL from 14·09 ± 0·68 g C m−1 yr−1 on 1-m plots to 50·03 ± 2·89 g C m−1 yr−1 on 5-m plots illustrated an increase in sheet erosion efficiency with increasing slope length. Both TOCL and sediment enrichment in OC correspondingly increased with a decrease in soil basal grass cover. The characteristics of rainstorms had no significant impact on the selectivity of OC erosion. The results accrued in this study investigating the links between sheet erosion and OC losses, are expected to be of future value in the generation of carbon specific erosion models, which can further help to inform and improve climate change mitigation measures.",10.1002/esp.3916,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/9816,2016-08,Earth Surface Processes and Landforms,1979337,John Wiley,41,10,land degradation; climate; carbon cycle; grassland; africa,,1399-1408

We parameterized the model for West African savannas and extended it by including sub-models to simulate fire management, grazing, and wood cutting. The model projects that under future climate without human land use impacts, large savanna areas would shift toward more wood dominated vegetation due to CO2 fertilization effects, increased water use efficiency and decreased fire activity.

The Challenges of Rainfed Agricultural Practices in Mali-Redefining Research Agenda- A Short Communication,"Birhanu, Z B",ICRISAT (Bamako),"Mali is one of the least developed countries with an economy that relies heavily on rainfed cereal production. Rural communities are faced with extreme poverty as a result of unpredictable rainfall pattern and lack of appropriate agricultural intervention practices. Most agronomic practices in support of development in the past had emphasized farm-level productivity issues with limited scope for managing interactions among components and actors beyond the level of the farm. Several studies showed different techniques practiced at farm level to improve the agricultural productivity. However rural communities at large are unable to cope with the impacts of climate change and other shocks related to agricultural input supplies and market access. In this short communication paper recent findings related to the challenges of rainfed agricultural practices were discussed to inform policy makers, researchers and development practitioners to re-define approaches towards sustainable agricultural development.

Several land management practices such as the suppression of tillage in agroecosystems and livestock exclusion in grasslands had initially been thought to store more carbon into the soil, but recent research puts this into question. In a context where finding effective C sequestration methods is urgent, the main objective of this study was to assess the ability of an innovative grassland management practice based on high density and short duration (HDSD) grazing to sequester atmospheric C into soils. The study was performed in a degraded communal rangeland in South Africa where soil organic C (SOC) depletion ranged from 5 to 95% depending on the degradation level, which varied from non-degraded (ND; with grass above ground coverage, Cov of 100%), degraded (D1; 50 < Cov < 75%), D2 (25 < Cov < 50%) and HD (highly degraded: Cov < 5%). The ability of HDSD (1200 cows ha− 1 for 3 days a year) to replenish SOC stocks was compared to four commonly used strategies: (1) livestock exclosure (E); (2) livestock exclosure with topsoil tillage (ET); (3) livestock exclosure with NPK fertilization (2:3:3, 22 at 0.2 t ha− 1) (EF); (4) annual burning (AB); all treatments being compared to traditional free grazing control. A total of 540 soil samples were collected in the 0–0.05 m soil layer for all treatments and degradation intensities. After two years, topsoil SOC stocks were significantly increased under EF and HDSD, by an average of 33.4 ± 0.5 and 12.4 ± 2.1 g C m2 y− 1, respectively. In contrast, AB reduced SOC stocks by 3.6 ± 3.0 g C m2 y− 1, while the impact of E and ET was not significant at P < 0.05. HDSD replenished SOC stocks the most at D1 and D2 (6.7 and 7.4% y− 1) and this was explained by grass recovery, i.e. a significant increase in soil surface coverage by grass and grass production. HDSD is cost-effective, and thus has great potential to be widely adopted by smallholder farmers.",10.1016/j.geoderma.2016.02.010,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/9842,2016-06,Geoderma,167061,Elsevier,271,,grassland; degradation; rehabilitation; grazing; climate change; sequestration,,10-17

We used qualitative interviews to understand the criteria by which farmers evaluate cropping systems, and data from crop trials to assess common bean ((Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and maize (Zea mays L.)) sole crops and inter crops against those criteria. We found that an improved inter cropping system tends to outperform the government-mandated system of alternating sole-cropped bean and maize season-by-season, on all four of the criteria tested. Although Rwanda’s agricultural intensification strategy aims to improve rural livelihoods through agricultural modernization, it fails to acknowledge the multiple and currently non-replaceable benefits that diverse cropping systems provide, particularly food security and risk management.

However, the performance of CA under different environments and its ability to improve ecosystem services is still unclear. The effects of the CA options; direct seeding, rip-line seeding, and seeding into planting basins on maize grain yield, soil health and profitability across agro-ecological regions in Zimbabwe were evaluated through a review of literature in combination with meta-analysis. Overall, CA improved maize yield over conventional agriculture. Compared to conventional agriculture, direct seeding, rip-line seeding, and seeding into planting basins increased yield by 445, 258 and 241 kg ha−1, respectively. However, there was an initial yield decline in the first two years. CA practices reduced soil erosion and bulk density, and increased soil water content in most studies. Under high levels of residue retention (6 Mg ha−1), CA systems exhibited greater macro fauna abundance and diversity than conventional agriculture, particularly termites. Weed pressure tended to increase labour requirement for hand-hoe weeding under CA compared to conventional agriculture. However, the use of herbicides reduced weeding labour demand during the early season. The benefits of CA are tied to the farmers’ management intensity including: time of planting, weeding, fertiliser and herbicide application, and adequate training on equipment use. Economic analysis results showed that on average, a farmer incurs losses for switching from conventional agriculture to CA in the main maize growing regions of Zimbabwe. Based on the six seasons’ data, the losses were least with the ripper in drier areas and worst with the direct seeder in wetter areas. Incorporation of chemical herbicides worsens the economic returns of CA tillage options in all the agro-ecological zones. Overall, the study showed that the rip-line seeding is more attractive in the drier areas than direct seeding. Although not costed in this study, critical is the cumulative reversal of soil degradation associated with consistent CA practice which can sustain agriculture. Results from this review suggest that the benefits of CA depend largely on the type and context of CA being practised. It is thus imperative to profile the technology, the farmer socio-economic circumstances and the bio-physical environment in which the farmer operates for proper geographical and beneficiary targeting to achieve greater impact.

It is primarily cultivated for grain production, but its stover is also valued as dry fodder. Pearl millet is resilient to climate change due to its inherent adaptability to drought and high temperatures. It is also tolerant of saline and acid soils, and is well adapted to marginal lands with low productivity. Pearl millet germplasm exhibits large genetic variability for yield components; and various agronomic, adaptation and nutritional traits. Open pollinated varieties and hybrids are two important cultivar options, but higher productivity is realized through hybrids. Pearl millet has fewer pest and disease problems compared to other cereals and is suited to different cropping systems. It is highly responsive to improved crop management practices, as witnessed in parts of India where it is grown as an irrigated summer crop that produces higher yields and better quality grain. Pearl millet has high nutritional value in terms of high levels of energy, dietary fibre, proteins with a balanced amino acid profile, many essential minerals, some vitamins, and antioxidants.

(1) characterize the rainfall and growing season patterns experienced by smallholder farmers, and (2)
measure soil water dynamics in ripper and basin tillage systems being promoted in the semi-arid
Limpopo Basin of southern Africa. The results show that the second half of the growing season

Despite this, it is not yet fully understood how grassland SOC stocks respond to degradation, particularly for the different environmental conditions found globally. The objective of this review was to elucidate the impact of grassland degradation on changes in SOC stocks and the main environmental controls, worldwide, as a prerequisite for rehabilitation. A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted using 55 studies with 628 soil profiles under temperate, humid, sub-humid, tropical and semi-arid conditions, to compare SOC stocks in the topsoil of non-degraded and degraded grassland soils. Grassland degradation significantly reduced SOC stocks by 16% in dry climates (<600 mm) compared to 8% in wet climates (>1000 mm) and Asia was the most affected continent (−23.7%). Moreover, the depletion of SOC stock induced by degradation was more pronounced in sandy (<20% clay) soils with a high SOC depletion of 10% compared to 1% in clayey (≥32% clay) soils. Furthermore, grassland degradation significantly reduced SOC by 14% in acidic soils (pH ≤ 5), while SOC changes were negligible for higher pH. Assuming that 30% of grasslands worldwide are degraded, the amount of SOC likely to be lost would be 4.05 Gt C, with a 95% confidence between 1.8 and 6.3 Gt C (i.e. from 1.2 to 4.2% of the whole grassland soil stock).

In search of options to cope with climate change and variability, a trial combining fertilization and improved varieties of millet and cowpea (intercropped or as sole crop) was conducted on three sites (Lemnogo, Tibtenga and Ramdolla) in the northern region of Burkina Faso. The application of cattle manure (3 t ha−1), micro-dose (3 g hole−1 equivalent to 62 kg ha−1) of a mineral fertilizer composed of 14 % N, 23 % P2O5 and 14 % K2O (NPK), their combination and a control (no manure and no NPK) as four soil fertilization options, two improved varieties of millet (SOSAT-C88 and IKMP5), two varieties of cowpea (KVX 396-4-5-2D and KVX 61-1) and two cropping systems (millet–cowpea intercropping, sole crop) were tested on-farm for two seasons (2013 and 2014). During the third season a survey was conducted on the acceptability by farmers of the tested combinations as a way of buffering or coping with rainfall variability.

Results

Two-year trial revealed that the combination of manure and NPK applied to the intercropping of millet and cowpea significantly increased crop production (land equivalent ratio = 1.83 ± 0.18 and 1.78 ± 0.20, intercropping millet variety IKMP5 with cowpea KVX 61-1 and intercropping millet variety SOSAT-C88 with cowpea KVX 396-4-5-2D, respectively). During erratic rainfall year, intercropping millet IKMP5 and cowpea KVX 61-1 performed the best, while under well-distributed rainfall conditions, intercropping millet SOSAT-C88 with cowpea KVX 396-4-5-2D displayed higher production, respectively, for millet and cowpea. Some varieties were not well accepted by most farmers (based on a survey of 36 farmers) mainly because of loss in grains before harvest for millet IKMP5 (97 %) and high grain attacks by insects in storage for cowpea KVX 61-1 (89 %). The alternative for farmers rejecting these varieties could be the intercropping of millet SOSAT-C88 and cowpea KVX 396-4-5-2D fertilized with manure.

Conclusions

Making weather forecasts and related agronomic advices available to farmers in this region will allow them to better plan their agricultural practices such as mineral fertilizer application and will also be a great move toward climate-smart agriculture. Developing more performant storage measures that drastically reduce insect attacks for some of the tested varieties (cowpea KVX 61-1, for instance) could contribute to promoting their adoption.",10.1186/s40066-016-0067-3,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/9730,2016,Agriculture & Food Security,2048-7010,BioMed Central,5,20,acceptability; climate risks; climate-smart agriculture; soil fertilization; cropping systems; farming productivity; burkina faso; climate change,,01-12

the challenges of global food security under the looming
threats of climate change, soil degradation and rising

pigeonpea breeding research and suggests the growth
trajectory for future programmes related to breeding of
high yielding pure line and hybrid cultivars. In the past few
decades, three pigeonpea breeding milestones have made
their mark. These include development of (i) medium
maturing disease resistant pigeonpea cultivars for greater
yield and stability, (ii) high yielding early maturing
pigeonpea cultivars for area expansion involving new
production niches, and (iii) a trend setting hybrid breeding
technology for breaking the decades-old low yield plateau.

Transformative management approaches and technology solutions will be required in the major grain-producing areas that provide the basis for future food and nutrition security. This study was conducted in four locations representing major food production systems of densely populated regions of South Asia. Novel production-scale research platforms were established to assess and optimize three futuristic cropping systems and management scenarios (S2, S3, S4) in comparison with current management (S1). With best agronomic management practices (BMPs), including conservation agriculture (CA) and cropping system diversification, the productivity of rice- and wheat-based cropping systems of South Asia increased substantially whereas the global warming potential intensity decreased. Positive economic returns and less use of water, labor, nitrogen, and fossil fuel energy per unit food produced were achieved. In comparison to S1, S4, in which BMPs, CA and crop diversification were implemented in the most integrated manner, achieved 54% higher grain energy yield with a 104% increase in economic returns, 35% lower total water input, and a 43% lower global warming potential intensity. Conservation agriculture practices were most suitable for intensifying as well as diversifying wheat-rice rotations, but less so for rice-rice systems.

Technical and institutional attributes constraining the performance of small-scale irrigation in Ethiopia,"Amede, T",ICRISAT (Nairobi),"Small-scale irrigation is playing an important role in adapting to climate change, achieving food security, and improving household incomes. The Ethiopian Government considers irrigated agriculture as a primary engine of economic growth and plans to increase the current level of irrigation infrastructure three-fold by the end of 2015. However, there has been concern regarding the performance and management of existing small-scale irrigation. Based on the assessment of 52 small-scale irrigation schemes, and three case study sites, we describe the challenges and interventions required to improve irrigation water management in Ethiopia. Though most schemes are operational, many do not operate at full capacity, due to design failures, excessive siltation, poor agronomic and water management practices, and weak local institutions. In addition to low returns, there is competition for irrigation water between upstream and downstream users, vegetable growers and cereal growers, and between farmers with large irrigable plots and those with small plots. Despite these challenges, our field assessment revealed that small scale irrigation increases crop yields, improves crop diversification, and reduces the risk of crop failure. We emphasize in this paper the need for incentives to improve productivity and minimize conflicts, while enhancing innovation capacity, developing scheme-specific intensification strategies, and promoting collective action. We also describe how benefits from water investments could be substantially increased by overcoming design constraints, strengthening water user associations, and protecting catchments.",10.1016/j.wrr.2014.10.005,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/9360,2015-11,Water Resources and Rural Development,6082,Elsevier,6,-,irrigation management; water; productivity; incentives; communities; small-scale irrigation; ethiopia,,78-91

Therefore, we studied the direct effects of CO2 and temperature on larval development and metabolism in cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner). The larvae were reared under a range of CO2 (350, 550, and 750 ppm) and temperature (15, 25, 35, and 45°C) regimes on artificial diet. Elevated CO2 negatively affected the larval survival, larval weight, larval period, pupation, and adult emergence, but showed a positive effect on pupal weight, pupal period, and fecundity. Increase in temperature exhibited a negative effect on larval survival, larval period, pupal weights, and pupal period, but a positive effect on larval growth. Pupation and adult emergence were optimum at 25°C. Elevated CO2 and temperature increased food consumption and metabolism of larvae by enhancing the activity of midgut proteases, carbohydrases (amylase and cellulase), and mitochondrial enzymes and therefore may cause more damage to crop production. Elevated CO2 and global warming will affect insect growth and development, which will change the interactions between the insect pests and their crop hosts.

Vegetable and legume production and consumption are a potent mechanism for small-scale, disadvantaged farmers to obtain the required nutrients in their diets and to generate much-needed income through trade. Vegetables and legumes are key sources of nutrients and health-promoting phytochemicals, providing higher micronutrient contents and a wider spectrum of essential compounds to meet nutritional and health needs than other food sources. Diversifying diets with vegetables and legumes is a cheaper, surer, and more sustainable way to supply a range of nutrients to the body and combat malnutrition and associated health problems than other approaches that target only a single or a few nutritional factors. Furthermore, vegetables and legumes often accompany staple crops in meals, and most staple crops are less palatable without vegetable or legume accompaniments.

However, there is a wide range in quality and spatial and temporal scale and resolution of climate and soil data underpinning these studies, as well as widely differing assumptions about cropping-system context and crop model calibration. Here we present an explicit rationale and methodology for selecting data sources for simulating crop yields and estimating yield gaps at specific locations that can be applied across widely different levels of data availability and quality. The method consists of a tiered approach that identifies the most scientifically robust requirements for data availability and quality, as well as other, less rigorous options when data are not available or are of poor quality. Examples are given using this approach to estimate maize yield gaps in the state of Nebraska (USA), and at a national scale for Argentina and Kenya. These examples were selected to represent contrasting scenarios of data availability and quality for the variables used to estimate yield gaps. The goal of the proposed methods is to provide transparent, reproducible, and scientifically robust guidelines for estimating yield gaps; guidelines which are also relevant for simulating the impact of climate change and land-use change at local to global spatial scales. Likewise, the improved understanding of data requirements and alternatives for simulating crop yields and estimating yield gaps as described here can help identify the most critical “data gaps” and focus global efforts to fill them.

Climate change impacts on phenology and yields of five broadacre crops at four climatologically distinct locations in Australia,"Anwar, M R; Liu, D L; Farquharson, R; Macadam, I; Abadi, A; Finlayson, J; Wang, B; Ramilan, T","NSW Department of Primary Industries, Wagga Wagga Agricultural Institute (Wagga Wagga); Graham Centre for Agricultural Innovation (An alliance between NSW Department of Primary Industries and Charles Sturt University) (Wagga Wagga); Melbourne School of Land & Environment and Future Farm Industries Cooperative Research Centre, University of Melbourne (Victoria); Climate Change Research Centre and ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, University of New South Wales (Sydney); Department of Parks and Wildlife Western Australia, Department of Agriculture and Food Western Australia and Future Farm Industries Cooperative Research Centre (Perth); Plant Biology and Climate Change Cluster, University of Technology Sydney (Broadway); ICRISAT (Patancheru)","Shifts in rainfall and rising temperatures due to climate change pose a formidable challenge to the sustainability of broadacre crop yields in Western and South-Eastern Australia. Output from18 Global Climate Models (GCMs) for the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 scenario was statistically downscaled to four contrasting locations. For the first time in these regions, bias corrected statistically downscaled climate data were employed to drive the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) crop model that integrates the effects of soil, crop phenotype, and management options for a quantitative comparison of crop yields and phenology under an historical and a plausible projected climate. The dynamic APSIM simulation model explore the implications of climate change across multiple locations and multiple time periods (1961–2010, 2030, 2060 and 2090) for multiple key crops (wheat, barley, lupin, canola, field pea) grown in three different types of soil. On average, the ensemble of downscaled GCM projections show a decrease in rainfall in the future at the four locations considered, with increased variability at two locations. At all locations and for five crops, future changes in both crop biomass and grain yield are strongly associated with changes in rainfall (P = 0.05 to P = 0.001). The overall rainfall amount is critical in determining yields but, equally, higher future temperatures can contribute to reducing crop productivity primarily due to advanced crop phenology. For example, for wheat cropping at Hamilton (a higher rainfall site), there is a significant advancement in median flowering date for 2030, 2060, and 2090 of 10, 18, and 29 days respectively with a significant 0.50% grain yield changes for each percentage change in rainfall compared to significant 0.90% grain yield changes in Cunderdin (a lower rainfall site). At all sites except Hamilton, the change in crop grain yield is significantly correlated (P = 0.001) with the percentage change in the future rainfall and the impact increased progressively from higher rainfall to lower rainfall sites. However, the magnitude of the change in crop phenology and yield were not significantly different between soil types. These results help to define regions of concern and their relative importance in the coming years. In this future climate the negative consequences for crop yields and advancement of phenology relative to baseline are not uniform across crops and locations. Of the crops studied – wheat, barley, lupin, canola and field pea – field pea is the most sensitive to the projected future climate changes, and the ensemble median changes in field pea yield range from a decrease of 12% to a decrease of 45%, depending on location. These results highlight the importance of research and policy to support strategies for adapting to climate change, such as advances in agronomy, soil moisture conservation, seasonal climate forecasting and breeding new crop varieties.",10.1016/j.agsy.2014.09.010,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/9082,2015-01,Agricultural Systems,0308-521X,Elsevier Ltd,132,,crops; climate change; gcm; apsim; yield; phenology,,133-144
Strategic double cropping on Vertisols: A viable rainfed cropping option in the Indian SAT to increase productivity and reduce risk,"Nageswara Rao, V; Meinke, H; Craufurd, P Q; Parsons, D; Kropff, M J; Anten, N P R; Wani, S P; Rego, T J","ICRISAT (Patancheru); Centre for Crop Systems Analysis (CCSA), Wageningen University and Research (Wageningen); School of Land and Food, Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture, University of Tasmania (Hobart)","Our study suggests the possibility for transformational change in the productivity and risk profile of some of India's rainfed cropping systems. In the semi-arid regions of Southern India, farmers traditionally crop sorghum or chickpea on Vertisols during the post-rainy season, keeping the fields fallow during the rainy season. This practice avoids land management problems, but limits the potential for crop intensification to increase systems productivity. A long-term (15 year) experiment at ICRISAT demonstrated that cropping during the rainy season is technically feasible, and that grain productivity of double cropped sorghum + chickpea (SCP–SCP) and mung bean + sorghum (MS–MS) sequential systems were higher than their conventional counterparts with rainy season fallow, i.e. fallow + post-rainy sorghum (FS–FS) and fallow + post-rainy chickpea (FS–FCP). Without N application, mean grain yield of post-rainy sorghum in the MS–MS system was significantly greater (2520 kg ha−1 per two-year rotation) than in the FS–FS system (1940 kg ha−1 per two-year rotation), with the added benefit of the mung bean grain yield (1000 kg ha−1 per two-year rotation) from the MS–MS system. In the SCP–SCP system the additional grain yield of rainy sorghum (3400 kg ha−1 per two-year rotation) ensured that the total productivity of this system was greater than all other systems. Double cropping MS–MS and SCP–SCP sequential systems had significantly higher crop N uptake compared to traditional fallow systems at all rates of applied nitrogen (N).

The intensified MS–MS and SCP–SCP sequential systems without any N fertilizer applied recorded a much higher median gross profit of Rs. 20,600 (US $ 375) and Rs. 15,930 (US $ 290) ha−1 yr−1, respectively, compared to Rs. 1560 (US $ 28) ha−1 yr−1) with the FS–FS system. Applying 120 kg of N ha−1 considerably increased the profitability of all systems, lifting median gross profits of the sorghum + chickpea system over Rs. 60,000 (US $ 1091) ha−1 yr−1 and the conventional system to Rs. 20,570 (US $ 374) ha−1 yr−1. The gross profit margin analysis showed that nitrogen is a key input for improving productivity, particularly for the double cropping systems. However, traditional systems are unviable and risky without N application in the variable climates of the semi-arid tropics. Together, our results show that on Vertisols in semi-arid India, double cropping systems increase systems’ productivity, and are financially more profitability and less risky than traditional fallow post-rainy systems while further benefits can be achieved through fertilizer application.",10.1016/j.eja.2014.09.003,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/9353,2015-01,European Journal of Agronomy,1873-7331,Elsevier,62,-,rainy season fallow; vertisol; long-term experiment; crop intensification; grain legume; gross profit; stochastic dominance; risk assessment rainy season fallow; risk assessment; climate change,,26-37

The threatening scenario imposed by climate change highlights the need for concerted research approaches in order to develop crops that are able to cope with environmental stresses, while increasing yield and quality. During the last decade, some physiological components and molecular players underlying abiotic stress responses of a broad range of legume species have been elucidated. Plant physiology approaches provided general outlines of plant responses, identifying stress tolerance-related traits or elite cultivars. A thorough identification of candidate genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with these traits followed. Model legumes like Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonicus, and more recently, Glycine max provided valuable translational approaches for dissecting legume responses to abiotic stresses. The challenge now focuses on the translation of the information gained in model systems in controlled environments to crops grown under field conditions. In this review, we provide a general overview of the recent achievements on the study of abiotic stress responses in a broad range of model, grain and forage legumes species, highlighting the different approaches used. Major accomplishments, as well as limitations or drawbacks are discussed across the different sections.

enhance ecosystem functions, especially the ability of soils to sequester atmospheric carbon (C), while
enhancing food and biomass production. The objective of this study was to assess CO2 emissions in the
soil surface following tillage abandonment and to investigate some of the underlying soil physical,
chemical and biological controls. Maize (Zea mays) was planted under conventional tillage (T) and
no-tillage (NT), both without crop residues under smallholder farming conditions in Potshini, South
Africa. Intact top-soil (0–0.05 m) core samples (N = 54) from three 515m2 plots per treatment were
collected two years after conversion of T to NT to evaluate the short-term CO2 emissions. Depending on
the treatment, cores were left intact, compacted by 5 and 10%, or had surface crusts removed. They were
incubated for 20 days with measurements of CO2 fluxes twice a day during the first three days and once a
day thereafter. Soil organic C (SOC) content, soil bulk density (rb), aggregate stability, soil organic matter
quality, and microbial biomass and its activity were evaluated at the onset of the incubation. CO2
emissions were 22% lower under NT compared with T with CO2 emissions of 0.90.10 vs 1.10.10mg
C–CO2 gC1 day1 under NT and T, respectively, suggesting greater SOC protection under NT. However,
there were greater total CO2 emissions per unit of surface by 9% under NT compared to T (1.150.03 vs
1.050.04 g C–CO2m2 day1). SOC protection significantly increased with the increase in soil bulk
density (r = 0.89) and aggregate stability (from 1.70.25mmto 2.30.31, r = 0.50), and to the decrease in
microbial biomass and its activity (r =0.59 and 0.57, respectively). In contrast, the greater NT CO2
emissions per m2 were explained by top-soil enrichment in SOC by 48% (from 12.40.2 to
19.10.4 g kg1, r = 0.59). These results on the soil controls of tillage impact on CO2 emissions are
expected to inform on the required shifts in agricultural practices for enhancing C sequestration in soils.
In the context of the study, any mechanism favoring aggregate stability and promoting SOC allocation
deep in the soil profile rather than in the top-soil would greatly diminish soil CO2 outputs and thus
stimulate C sequestration.",10.1016/j.agee.2015.02.001,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/8673,2015,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",0167-8809,Elsevier,203,,no-tillage; carbon dioxide; climate change; maize; small holders; africa,,110-118

Current research efforts have identified NUCS as having potential to reduce food and nutrition insecurity, particularly for resource poor households in SSA. This is because of their adaptability to low input agricultural systems and nutritional composition. However, what is required to promote NUCS is scientific research including agronomy, breeding, post-harvest handling and value addition, and linking farmers to markets. Among the essential knowledge base is reliable information about water utilisation by NUCS with potential for commercialisation.

This study assessed genetic variability for heat tolerance in chickpea and identified sources of heat tolerance that could be used for crop improvement. One hundred and sixty-seven genotypes were grown in two environments (heat stressed/late sown and non-stressed/optimal sowing time) in 2 years (2009–2010 and 2010–2011) at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, India. Large genetic variation was observed for phenology, growth, yield components and grain yield. While phenology (assessed as days to first flower, days to 50% flowering and days to first pod) was negatively correlated with grain yield at high temperature; plant biomass, pod number, filled pod number and seed number per plant were positively correlated. Genotypes were classified into short and long duration groups based on their maturity. Days to first flowering (DFF) of long duration genotypes were negatively associated with grain yield under stressed conditions in both years compared with medium to short duration genotypes. However, genotypes varied in their heat sensitivity and temperatures ≥35 °C produced yield losses up to 39%. A heat tolerance index (HTI) classified the genotypes into five groups: (i) stable heat tolerant (>0.5), (ii) moderately heat tolerant (0.1–0.49), (iii) stable heat sensitive (−ve values), (iv) heat tolerant to moderately sensitive (−0.10 to 1) and (v) heat sensitive to moderately tolerant (−0.5 to 0.4).

Taken as a whole, this means more complex and integrated objectives for breeders. Several illustrations will be given of breeding such complex traits for different annual legume species. Genetic diversity for root development and for the ability to establish efficient symbioses with rhizobia and mycorrhiza can contribute to better resource management (N, P, water). Shoot architectures and phenologies can contribute to yield and biotic constraint protection (parasitic weeds, diseases or insects) reducing pesticide use. Variable maturity periods and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses are key features for the introduction of annual legumes to low input cropping systems and for enlarging cultivated area. Adaptation to intercropping requires adapted genotypes. Improved health and nutritional value for humans are key objectives for developing new markets. Modifying product composition often requires the development of specific cultivars and sometimes the need to break negative genetic correlations with yield. A holistic approach in legume breeding is important for defining objectives with farmers, processors and consumers.

crop improvement in order to meet future global challenges in relation to food and nutritional security.This paper comprehensively
reviews four important areas; (i) the significance of plant genetic diversity (PGD) and PGR especially on agriculturally important
crops (mostly field crops); (ii) risk associated with narrowing the genetic base of current commercial cultivars and climate change;
(iii) analysis of existing PGD analytical methods in pregenomic and genomic era; and (iv) modern tools available for PGD analysis

better and rapid assessment, for utilization of germplasm from gene banks to their applied breeding programs. With the advent
of new biotechnological techniques, this process of genetic manipulation is now being accelerated and carried out with more

identity, and access to database, for prebreeding activities. Since plant breeding research and cultivar development are integral
components of improving food production, therefore, availability of and access to diverse genetic sources will ensure that the global

Evaluating Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Potential of Conservation Agriculture in Semi-arid Tropics of Southern India,"Jat, R A; Wani, S P; Pathak, P; Singh, P; Sahrawat, K L; Chander, G; Sudi, R",ICRISAT (Patancheru),"Aims: As climate change related rainfall and temperature variability is being increasingly experienced in the SAT regions, we assessed climate change mitigation and adaptation potential of Conservation Agriculture (CA) by studying effects of minimum tillage (MT) and residue management practices on rain water use efficiency (RWUE), soil moisture, runoff, energy use and carbon dioxide emission in two maize-legume cropping systems.
Study Design: The experiment was laid out in split-split plot design with four replications.
Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) farm, Patancheru, Telangana, India during 2010-11 and 2011-12.
Methodology: RWUE was calculated as maize equivalent yield divided by rainfall received during the crop season. Integrated digital runoff and soil loss monitoring unit (IDRSMU) was used to measure runoff. Soil moisture content was measured using the gravimetric method (0-30 cm depth) and neutron probe (60-90 cm depth). The soil organic carbon was analyzed following the Walkley-Black method [1]. The diesel consumption in MT and conventional tillage (CT) was estimated following Downs and Hansen (http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs) and emission of CO2 was estimated according to EPA, 2009 [2].
Results: Tillage and residue management practices did not show significant effect on RWUE except; CT having significantly higher RWUE over MT during 2011-12. Effect of cropping systems on RWUE was significant but variable during the two years of study. MT-RT (minimum tillage- residue retained) reduced total seasonal runoff by 28.62% and 80.22% compared to CT-RR (conventional tillage- residue removed) in 2010-11 and 2011-12, respectively. Similarly, MT-RT reduced rainwater loss and peak rate of runoff compared to CT-RR in both the years of study. During 2010, MT-RT had higher total soil moisture (v/v) in the 0-90 cm soil depth in sole as well as intercropped maize compared to CT-RR, however, during 2011 MT-RT had higher total soil moisture in sole maize only. As compared to CT, even though, MT improved SOC in 0-15 cm depth but lowered slightly in 15-30 cm depth. RT (residue retained) improved SOC in 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths compared to residue removal (RR). MT-RT had higher or equal SOC in 0-15 and 15-30 cm soil depths compared to CT-RR in both the maize-legume cropping systems. MT saved energy corresponding to 41.49 l of diesel per hectare annually compared to CT. Similarly, MT emitted 110.79 kg less CO2 annually on per hectare basis compared to CT due to reduced diesel use.

in average temperatures. A linear trend analysis of rainfall and temperature data from 1980 to 2011 corroborated the
farmers’ perceptions. Farmers’ adaptation options included adjusting planting dates and crop diversification. Off-farm
income has reduced the dependence of the farmers on agriculture. A multinomial regression analysis showed that socioeconomic
factors such as gender, age, number of cattle owned, land size and average crop yields influenced farmer
adaptation strategies. The study concludes that although farmers are diverse in their socio-economic attributes, they

Sensitivity of Livestock Production to Climatic Variability Under Indian Drylands and Future Perspective,"Kumar, S; Raju, B M K; Ramarao, C A; Ramilan, T",ICRISAT (Patancheru),"The livestock production system is considered equally sensitive to climate change as that of core agriculture system and at the same time livestock itself is also contributing to the phenomenon. The present paper attempts to analyze the sensitivity of livestock productivity in rainfed regions to climatic variability, significance of climate change with respect to Indian livestock and mitigation options and leverage points in such a scenario. The sensitively of livestock productivity was examined by using district level data of milk productivity of cow as well as buffalo for the year 1992 and 1997 for 100 districts which was regressed on important weather variables. The analysis shows that weather variables like rainfall and temperature do significantly influence the milk productivity of animals in rainfed regions.  Increased climatic variability due to changing climate  is likely to negatively influence the livestock productivity. Based on analysis and stakeholders consultation the paper suggests appropriate adaptation strategies particularly focusing on mitigating feed scarcity situations arising due to climatic variability.",10.12944/carj.3.2.08,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/9199,2015,Current Agriculture Research Journal,2321–9971,Enviro Research Publishers,3,2,livestock; sensitivity to climatic variability; drylands; adaptation; climate change,,142-149

This paper examines farmers' perceptions and understanding of climatic variability, coping strategies adopted and factors that influence the choice of a particular adaptation. The study uses cross section data collected from 510 farmers in three mountain gradients sites, namely; Mount Kilimanjaro of Tanzania, Taita and
Machakos Hills of Kenya. Farmers’ perceptions were compared to actual trend in meteorological records over the last thirty years (1981-2010). The result revealed that farmers in East Africa were partly aware of climate variability, mainly in temperature and rainfall patterns. Many respondents reported that conditions are drier and rainfall timing is becoming less predictable. The perception of farmers on temperature and rainfall were in line with recorded meteorological data, but contrary with that of recorded rainfall in Machakos which was perceived to be decreasing by the farmers. Farmers
perceived changes in rainfall and temperature to have negative effects on the production and management of crops. The common adaptation strategies used by farmers include water harvesting, soil conservation techniques and shifting
of planting periods. The most important variables affecting farmers choices in regards to adaptation option were, lack of access to credit, farming experience and household size. As a conclusion, there is a need for these factors to be taken into account in the development and implementation of smallholder farmers’ adaptation strategies to climate variability in East Africa. Additionally, dedicated capacity building and extensive outreach initiatives on adaptation through governments, researchers, policy-makers and the farmers groups themselves are needed to achieve large scale success.",http://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/smallholder-farmers-perspectives-on-climatic-variability-andadaptation-strategies-in-east-africa-the-case-of-mount-kilimanjaro-int-2157-7617-1000313.php?aid=66337,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/9290,2015,Earth Science & Climatic Change,2157-7617,OMICS International,6,10,adaptation; climate variability; east africa; farmers’ perceptions; climate change,,01-09

In the present study, set in south India, farmer experience of climate risk is integrated in a bottom-up participatory approach with climate data analysis. Crop calendars are used as a boundary object to identify and rank climate and weather risks faced by smallhold farmers. A semi-structured survey was conducted with experienced farmers whose income is predominantly from farming. Interviews were based on a crop calendar to indicate the timing of key weather and climate risks. The simple definition of risk as consequence × likelihood was used to establish the impact on yield as consequence and chance of occurrence in a 10-year period as likelihood. Farmers’ risk experience matches well with climate records and risk analysis. Farmers’ rankings of ‘good’ and ‘poor’ seasons also matched up well with their independently reported yield data. On average, a ‘good’ season yield was 1·5–1·65 times higher than a ‘poor’ season. The main risks for paddy rice were excess rains at harvesting and flowering and deficit rains at transplanting. For cotton, farmers identified excess rain at harvest, delayed rains at sowing and excess rain at flowering stages as events that impacted crop yield and quality. The risk assessment elicited from farmers complements climate analysis and provides some indication of thresholds for studies on climate change and seasonal forecasts. The methods and analysis presented in the present study provide an experiential bottom-up perspective and a methodology on farming in a risky rainfed climate.

Optimizing dambo (seasonal wetland) cultivation for climate change adaptation and sustainable crop production in the smallholder farming areas of Zimbabwe,"Nyamadzawo, G; Wuta, M; Nyamangara, J; Nyamugafata, P; Chirinda, N",Bindura University of Science Education(Bindura); University of Zimbabwe(Harare); ICRISAT(Bulawayo),"Most smallholder farming areas of Zimbabwe have low soil fertility and low rainfall, which has continually decreased over the past years. In recent years, most of the smallholder farming areas have experienced perennial droughts, poor rainfall distribution and crop failures and these have been attributed to climate change and variability. Cultivation of dambos, which are seasonal wetlands, presents a climate change and variability adaptation option for smallholder farmers. This synthesis analyses the role of dambo cultivation in climate change and variability adaptation and discusses future directions for sustainable dambo utilization. The data on current dambo farming practices were collected from literature, surveys and field observations. The results showed that farmers grow crops in dambos as an adaptive strategy to climate change and variability and have largely abandoned upland fields where yields are <1 t ha−1 in preference of dambos where yields average 2–3 t ha−1. Dambo cultivation offers a buffer against crop failures and has resulted in improved household food security. We conclude that dambo cultivation is a potentially beneficial farmer-driven climate change and variability adaptation strategy. However, if not properly designed and managed, dambo cultivation may result in their degradation hence there is need for further research to evaluate options for sustainable dambo utilization as intensification of dambo agriculture is important for food security.",10.1080/14735903.2013.863450,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/7587,2015,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,1747-762X,Taylor & Francis,13,1,climate change; dambos; cultivation; household food security; climate smart agriculture,International Foundation of Science (IFS) [grant C/4569-1]; DAAD Fellowship [grant number A/10/03022],23-39

Unscrambling confounded effects of sowing date trials to screen for crop adaptation to high temperature,"Sadrasa, V O; Vadez, V; Purushothaman, R; Lake, L; Marrou, H","South Australian Research and Development Institute (Australia); ICRISAT(Patancheru); IndiacMontpellier Supagro, UMR System (France)","Against the backdrop of climate change, genotypes with improved adaptation to elevated temperature are required; reliable screening methods are therefore important. Sowing date experiments are a practical and in expensive approach for comparison of large collections of lines. Late-sown crops usually experience hotter conditions and phenotypes thus partially capture this environmental influence. Two sets of confounded factors, however, limit the value of sowing date trials. First, daily mean temperature correlates with both minimum and maximum temperature, photoperiod, radiation and vapour pressure deficit, and it may also correlate with rainfall. Second, temperature alters the genotype-dependent phen-ology of crops, effectively shifting the timing and duration of critical periods against the background of temperature and other environmental variables.Here we advance a crop-level framework to unscramble the confounded effects of sowing date experiments; it is based on four physiological concepts: (1) annual crops accommodate environmen-tal variation through seed number rather than seed size; (2) seed number is most responsive to the environment in species-specific critical windows; (3) non-stressful thermal effects affecting seed set through development and canopy size can be integrated in a photothermal quotient relating intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and mean temperature during the critical window; (4) stressful temperature reduces yield by disrupting reproduction.The framework was tested in a factorial experiment combining four chickpea varieties with puta-tively contrasting adaptation to thermal stress and five environments resulting from the combination of seasons and sowing dates. Yield ranged from 13 to 577 g m−2. Shifts in phenology led to contrasting photothermal conditions in the critical window between flowering and 400◦C d after flowering that were specific for each variety–environment combination. The photothermal quotient ranged from 2.72to 6.85 MJ m−2 ◦C−1; it explained 50% of the variation in yield and maximum temperature explained 32% of the remaining variation. Thus, half of the variation in yield was associated with developmental,non-stressful thermal effect and (at most) 16% of the variation was attributable to thermal stress. Thephotothermal quotient corrected by vapour pressure deficit accounted for by 75% of the variation in yieldand provided further insight on photosynthesis-mediated responses to temperature.Crop adaptation to non-stressful, developmental thermal effects and stressful temperatures disrupting reproduction involve different physiological processes and requires partially different agronomic and breeding solutions. Our analytical approach partially separates these effects, adds value to sowing datetrials, and is likely to return more robust rankings of varieties",10.1016/j.fcr.2015.02.024,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/8653,2015,Field Crops Research,0378-4290,Elsevier,177,,radiation use efficiency; vapour pressure deficit; heat; breeding; chickpea; phenologya; climate change,,1-8
"Soils of the Indo-Gangetic Plains: a pedogenic response to landscape stability, climatic variability and anthropogenic activity during the Holocene","Srivastava, P; Pal, D K; Aruche, K M; Wani, S P; Sahrawat, K L",University of Delhi (India); ICRISAT(Patancheru),"Bound by the Himalaya in the north and the Craton in the south, the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) is one of the largest fluvial plains of the world. The IGP is monotonously flat with a spread of surface soils in hot arid conditions of Rajasthan in west to per-humid conditions in West Bengal. The soil-geomorphology of the IGP detailed during the last few decades is useful in determining the interrelationship among the pedogenesis, the climate, and the landscape evolution during the Holocene. These studies demonstrate that the IGP soils developed on five geomorphic surfaces with varying degree of development. Soils occurring on older geomorphic surfaces (> 2.5 ka) are polygenetic with a distinct record of climatic changes and neotectonics.

The present synthesis is based on recent developments in pedology achieved through macro- and micromorphology, clay mineralogy, pedogenic calcrete, and polygenetic pedogenic features of the IGP soils. A critical evaluation of the IGP soils has helped to comprehend the subtle nuances of the pedogenic processes that were also influenced by anthropogenic activities and cultivation over this vast agricultural tract during the Holocene. We provide state-of-the-art information on the pedology, polygenesis, and soil degradation (natural and anthropogenic) over the last 10 ka. The review has potential as a reference for critical assessment of the pedosphere for health and quality in different parts of the world.

facilitates N-losses from production agriculture through nitrate-leaching and denitrification. This process
has a profound influence on what form of mineral-N is absorbed, used by plants, and retained in the soil,
or lost to the environment, which in turn affects N-cycling, N-use efficiency (NUE) and ecosystem health
and services. As reactive-N is often the most limiting in natural ecosystems, plants have acquired a range
of mechanisms that suppress soil-nitrifier activity to limit N-losses via N-leaching and denitrification.
Plants’ ability to produce and release nitrification inhibitors from roots and suppress soil-nitrifier activity
is termed ‘biological nitrification inhibition’ (BNI). With recent developments in methodology for insitu
measurement of nitrification inhibition, it is now possible to characterize BNI function in plants.
This review assesses the current status of our understanding of the production and release of biological
nitrification inhibitors (BNIs) and their potential in improving NUE in agriculture. A suite of genetic, soil
and environmental factors regulate BNI activity in plants. BNI-function can be genetically exploited to
improve the BNI-capacity of major food- and feed-crops to develop next-generation production systems

Balanced nutrition increases yield of pearl millet under drought,"Uppal, R K; Wani, S P; Garg, K K; Alagarswamy, G",ICRISAT (Patancheru),"Improving the climate resilience of crops is particularly important in the semi-arid tropics (SAT) where variability and uncertainty of precipitation is expected to increase under climate change with detrimental impacts on the vulnerability of livelihoods of small farm holders. This study analyses a long-term strategic experiment datasets from fifteen experiments (1981–1995) managed under different fertility level sat International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru and on-farm balanced nutrition management trials (2010–2012) in Karnataka, India to evaluate the pearl millet performance in contrasting seasons with improved agronomic management. Long-term climate variability and yield trends were analyzed using ICRISAT’s weather datasets. On-farm data analysis revealed that majority of farmers’ field soils were deficient in organic carbon, available phosphorous, sulphur, zinc and boron at all the locations studied. Pearl millet grain yield and above ground dry matter was improved significantly with balanced nutrient application (NPK + S + Zn + B) in farmers’ field which were critically deficient in the soil nutrients. Even in comparatively drier years, application of balanced nutrient significantly increased grain yield and aboveground dry matter which provides resilience against drought through enhanced water productivity. Long-term experiments conducted in ICRISAT showed that nitro-gen application increased grain yield and above ground dry matter in pearl millet however seasonal variability had a greater effect on yield than cultivars and applied N. Pearl millet yield was positively associated with August maximum temperature and negatively with seasonal precipitation. September precipitation >125 mm which coincided with grain filling stage reduced grain yield. Benefit: cost analysis showed that balanced nutrient application of pearl millet is an economically sustainable option across the seasons.

solar radiation, maximum (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin), and precipitation. In many regions,
however, daily weather data of sufficient quality and duration are not available. To overcome this limitation,
we evaluated a new method to create long-term weather series based on a few years of observed daily
temperature data (hereafter called propagated data). The propagated data are comprised of uncorrected
gridded solar radiation from the Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource dataset from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA–POWER), rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring
Mission (TRMM) dataset, and location-specific calibration of NASA–POWER Tmax and Tmin using a limited
amount of observed daily temperature data. The distributions of simulated yields of maize, rice, or wheat
with propagated data were compared with simulated yields using observed weather data at 18 sites in
North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Other sources of weather data typically used in crop
modeling for locations without long-term observed weather data were also included in the comparison:
(i) uncorrected NASA–POWER weather data and (ii) generated weather data using the MarkSim weather
generator. Results indicated good agreement between yields simulated with propagated weather data
and yields simulated using observed weather data. For example, the distribution of simulated yields
using propagated data was within 10% of the simulated yields using observed data at 78% of locations
and degree of yield stability (quantified by coefficient of variation) was very similar at 89% of locations. In
contrast, simulated yields based entirely on uncorrected NASA–POWER data or generated weather data
using MarkSim were within 10% of yields simulated using observed data in only 44 and 33% of cases,
respectively, and the bias was not consistent across locations and crops. We conclude that, for most locations,

It also discusses the limitation, constraints and pre-requisites in these approaches and highlights the importance of micro level information to have a more realistic understanding of impact and vulnerability through illustration and with reference to the recent study conducted by International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT). This exercise will provide a guiding framework for devising action plans in improving adaptive capacity among the vulnerable population.",10.1016/j.wace.2014.02.002,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/7562,2014-06,Weather and Climate Extremes,2212-0947,Elsevier,3,,drought; vulnerability; impact assessment; semi-arid tropics; climate change,Asian Development Bank (ADB),54-61
Helping farmers adapt to climate and cropping system change through increased access to sorghum genetic resources adapted to prevalent sorghum cropping systems in Burkina Faso,"Brocke, K V; Trouche, G; Weltzien, E; Kondombo Barro, C P; Sidibe, A; Zougmore, R B; Goze, E","CIRAD, UMR AGAP, ICRISAT (Bamako); CIRAD, UMR AGAP (Montpellier); ICRISAT (Bamako); INERA, Programme Céréales Traditionnelles, CRREA du Centre (Koudougou); Union de Groupement Pour la Commercialisation des Produits Agricole, Boucle du Mouhoun (Dedougou); CIRAD, UPR SCA (Montpellier)","Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is a major staple crop of Burkina Faso where farmers continue to cultivate photoperiod-sensitive guinea landraces as part of the strategy to minimize risk and ensure yield stability. In the Boucle du Mouhoun region, however, sorghum farmers appear to have insufficient varietal choice due to cropping systems having shifted towards more intensive cultivation of cotton and maize, and rainfall patterns having decreased over the past decade. In search for new varietal options that can respond to this changing context, researchers decided to give farmers access to ex-situ national collections along with the opportunity to evaluate recent improved varieties. From 2002 to 2007, researchers and farmers worked closely together to implement on-farm testing, including varietal selection trials, crop management and multi-locational trials. Farmers’ choices tend to differ among groups, villages and years, with the exception of four particular landraces: two originating from a collection carried out in the Mouhoun region more than 30 years previous to this research, and two other landraces that came from the dissimilar agro-ecological zones of Burkina Faso. These four were the most commonly selected landraces out of 36 cultivars that covered both improved and landrace varieties. Farmers’ selection criteria were focused on adaptation to agro-climatic conditions as well as specific grain qualities for processing and consumption. The potential usefulness of each variety was verified via multi-locational trials. The paper also shows that wide dissemination of experimental seed, not just across the Mouhoun region but also at a national scale, was largely achieved through collaboration with a strong farmer organisation in conjunction with farmer training programs focused on the on-farm seed production and the commercialisation of this seed.",10.1017/s0014479713000616,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/9043,2014-04,Experimental Agriculture,0014-4797,Cambridge University Press,50,2,sorghum; climate change; genetic resources; cropping systems; burkina faso,,284-305

Timing of sampling for the canopy temperature depression can be critical for the best differentiation of drought tolerance in chickpea,"Purushothaman, R; Krishnamurthy, L",Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (Hyderabad); ICRISAT(Patancheru),"Maintenance of water supply during grain filling is critical
for the drought adaptation of chickpea and therefore
measurements of canopy temperature depression (CTD)
could be used as a proxy for water extraction. However
the conditions and timing of such measurements are
not yet clear. CTD has been recognized as a highly
dependable trait for estimating the drought tolerance in
chickpea. This study was aimed at identifying an optimal
CTD sampling time under drought stress and an optimally
irrigated condition as well. In addition, it also involved
using 12 selected germplasm accessions to understand
the association of CTD, with the previously established
drought response and early rooting characteristics.
The growth stage involved identifying a sample which
included (i)combination of high genetic variation, (ii) best
differentiation of accessions by CTD, (iii) large number
of accessions exhibiting highly negative CTDs, (iv) high
heritability of CTD and (v) the best association of CTD

was 66 days after sowing (DAS) in 2009-10 and 70
DAS in 2010-11. Under optimally irrigated condition,
the critical timing of sampling was 70 DAS in 2009-10

Are pest regulation and erosion alleviation services conflicting or synergistic? Lessons from Sahel pearl millet,"Ratnadass, A; Kadi-Kadi, H; Salha, H; Mato, A; Idrissa, A; Hamidine, S; Oumarou, I; Fatondji, D",ICRISAT(Niamey),"From 2010 to 2011 in Niger, the effects of a wind erosion-alleviating practice, i.e. mulching pearl millet fields with crop residue, on populations of and damage induced by millet stem borer (MSB), head miner (MHM), and head scarab (MHS) were studied. Significant differences in the survival of MSB diapausing larvae in millet stems at the end of the dry season were found at both Sadore and Doukoudoukou. At Sadore, mean MSB larval survival in the treatment where stems were exported at harvest and stored on platforms (treatment 1) was 1.2/stem, i.e. significantly higher than in all other treatments. Survival was between 0.1 and 0.2 larva in treatments 2 (with millet stems left standing from harvest throughout the dry season) and 3 (with millet stems flattened toward the end of the dry season, four months after harvest). It was less than 0.1 larva in treatments 4 (with millet stems flattened in the middle of the dry season, two months after harvest) and 5 (with millet stems flattened at the beginning of the dry season, at harvest). At Doukoudoukou, mean MSB larval survival in treatment 1 was 0.14/stem, i.e. significantly higher than in treatments 4 and 5 (0.02–0.03 larva), with intermediary findings obtained in treatments 2 and 3 (0.04–0.08 larva). The population and biomass of diapausing MHM pupae and of MHS larvae in the soil were low at both locations, and not affected by crop residue management.

Climate Change Effects on Insects: Implications for Crop Protection and Food Security,"Sharma, H C",ICRISAT(Patancheru),"Global warming and climate change will trigger major changes in diversity and abundance of arthropods, geographical distribution of insect pests, insect population dynamics, insect biotypes, herbivore-plant interactions, activity and abundance of natural enemies, species extinction, and efficacy of crop protection technologies. Changes in geographical range and insect abundance will increase the extent of crop losses and, thus, will have a major bearing on crop production and food security. Distribution of insect pests will also be influenced by the changes in cropping patterns triggered by climate change. Major insect pests, such as cereal stem borers (Chilo, Sesamia, and Scirpophaga), pod borers (Helicoverpa, Maruca, and Spodoptera), aphids, and whiteflies may move to temperate regions, leading to greater damage in cereals, grain legumes, vegetables, and fruit crops. Host-plant resistance, biopesticides, natural enemies, and synthetic chemicals are some of the potential options for integrated pest management. However, the relative efficacy of many of these pest control measures is likely to change as a result of global warming. Climate change will also result in increased problems with insect-transmitted diseases. These changes will have major implications for crop protection and food security, particularly in developing countries where the need to increase and sustain food production is most urgent. Long-term monitoring of population levels and insect behavior, particularly in identifiably sensitive regions, may provide some of the first indications of a biological response to climate change.",10.1080/15427528.2014.881205,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/7938,2014,Journal of Crop Improvement,1542-7536,Taylor & Francis,28,,bioiversity; biopesticides; global warming; host-plant resistance; marker-assisted selection; pollinators; species extinction; synthetic insecticides; climate change,,229-259

We also investigated the potential benefits of incorporating drought and heat tolerance traits in chickpea using the chickpea model and the virtual cultivars approach. As compared to the baseline climate, the climate change by 2050 (including CO2) increased the yield of chickpea by 17% both at Hisar and Indore, 18% at Zaloke, 25% at Debre Zeit and 18% at Kabete; whereas the yields decreased by 16% at Nandhyal and 7% at Ukiriguru.

CSV 15 at both Akola and Indore) and Mali (cv. CSM 335 at Samanko and cv. CSM 63E at Cinzana), West Africa. Under current climate CSV 15 on average matured in 108 days and produced 3790 kg ha−1 grain yield at Akola; whereas at Indore it matured in 115 days and produced 3540 kg ha−1 grain yield. Similarly under current climate, CSM 335 matured in 120 days and produced 2700 kg ha−1 grain yield at Samanko; whereas CSM 63E matured in 85 days at Cinzana and produced 2210 kg ha−1 grain yield. Decreasing crop life cycle duration of cultivars by 10% decreased yields at all the sites under both current and future climates. In contrast, increasing crop life cycle by 10% increased yields up to 12% at Akola, 9% at Indore, 8% at Samanko and 33% at Cinzana. Enhancing yield potential traits (radiation use efficiency, relative leaf size and partitioning of assimilates to the panicle each increased by 10%) in the longer cycle cultivars increased the yields by 11–18% at Akola, 17–19% at Indore, 10–12% at Samanko and 14–25% at Cinzana under current and future climates of the sites. Except for the Samanko site, yield gains were larger by incorporating drought tolerance than heat tolerance under the current climate.

distribution, increased temperatures, depleting soil productivity and disturbing water balance. Based on daily
weather data of 41 years (1969-2009), productivity and water use of pigeonpea under eleven climate scenarios
are assessed using the pigeonpea model in Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). Simulations
are done with automatic sowing based on rainfall and soil moisture availability during the sowing window (15
Jun to 20 Aug) and following recommended crop management practices. Simulations show that increase in
temperature by 2°C could reduce pigeonpea yields by about 16%. Rainfall decrease of 10% from present
coupled with 2°C increase in temperature could reduce yields further by 4%, making the total reduction to be
at 20%. Crop duration was shortened by about 10 days and water use reduced by 25 mm with increase in
temperature. Increased rainfall scenarios have considerably reduced the adverse effects of higher temperature.

mustard (Brassica juncea), sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) and maize (Zea mays) by using the crop simulation

in both irrigated and rainfed mustard. Under irrigated conditions, the yield reduction in 2020, 2050 and 2080
would be highest in Eastern-IGP (Indo-Gangetic Plain) region followed by Central-IGP. This was due to maximum
projected rise in temperature in Eastern-IGP where maximum and minimum temperature would rise by 5.1°
and 5.6°C in 2080. The reduction of irrigated mustard yield was least in Northern-IGP under almost all scenarios.
But in western India, yield reduction gradually increased from 2020 to 2080. In future climate change scenarios,
the rainfall would be projected to increase in 2050 irrespective of the locations. But in 2020 and 2080 rainfall
would reduce in Northern-IGP, Western and Central India. This was reflected higher yield reduction in rainfed
mustard in these three locations. In sorghum, the future climate change scenario analysis showed that the
yields (CSH 16 and CSV 15) are likely to reduce at Akola, Anantpur, Coimbatore and Bijapur. But yield of CSH
16 will increase slightly in Gwalior (0.1%) at 2020 and thereafter it will decline. At Kota the sorghum yield is
likely to increase in 2020 (3.3 and 1.7 % in CSH 16 and CSV 15 respectively) with no change in 2050 and
yields will be reduced at 2080 in both varieties. Maize trend is similar from the sorghum impact except in the

Any crop science experiment that measures key physiological processes, tests these productive processes, their interaction with other processes, environment, and intra- and inter-specific variation, is valuable to inform and refine crop simulation models. This paper focuses on crop science experiments in three key areas—crop development, seed or fruit-set at high temperature, and water use—illustrating some of the experiments used to understand key processes and, equally importantly, quantify these processes for crop models in a robust and repeatable manner. One particularly useful experimental method for determining stages of development responsive to photoperiod and temperature (the main drivers of ontogenic development), and sensitive to abiotic stresses such as temperature extremes and water deficit, is transfer experiments between different environments or treatments. Once sensitive stages are defined, then responses and genotypic differences can be accurately quantified. Understanding and modeling transpiration, and particularly genotypic differences in processes affecting transpiration is also key process for crop modeling. Experiments to determine genotypic differences in soil water availability thresholds that control when transpiration is reduced, relations between transpiration and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and patterns of soil water uptake are also described along with new insights from this work. One of the biggest constraints to improving models with crop science experiments—and exploiting advances in genomics—is the limited capacity to phenotype traits and physiological mechanisms. Most crop science experiments have quantified responses in only a limited number of genotypes and the diversity of genotypic responses is not well represented. Today there is an increased demand for good quality phenotyping which can serve both genomics and modeling, and there is an urgent need to re-invest in crop physiology for high quality phenotyping.",10.1016/j.agrformet.2011.09.003,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/6073,2013,Agricultural and Forest Meteorology,0168-1923,Elsevier,170,,crop models; crop physiology; temperature; carbon dioxide; water stress; transpiration,,8-18

Landslide model performance in a high resolution small-scale landscape,"De Sy, V; Schoorl, J M; Keesstra, S D; Jones, K E; Claessens, L",Wageningen University(Wageningen); Victoria University of Wellington(Wellington); ICRISAT(Nairobi),"The frequency and severity of shallow landslides in New Zealand threatens life and property, both on- and off-site. The physically-based shallow landslide model LAPSUS-LS is tested for its performance in simulating shallow landslide locations induced by a high intensity rain event in a small-scale landscape. Furthermore, the effect of high resolution digital elevation models on the performance was tested. The performance of the model was optimized by calibrating different parameter values. A satisfactory result was achieved with a high resolution (1 m) DEM. Landslides, however, were generally predicted lower on the slope than mapped erosion scars. This discrepancy could be due to i) inaccuracies in the DEM or in other model input data such as soil strength properties; ii) relevant processes for this environmental context that are not included in the model; or iii) the limited validity of the infinite length assumption in the infinite slope stability model embedded in the LAPSUS-LS. The trade-off between a correct prediction of landslides versus stable cells becomes increasingly worse with coarser resolutions; and model performance decreases mainly due to altering slope characteristics. The optimal parameter combinations differ per resolution. In this environmental context the 1 m resolution topography resembles actual topography most closely and landslide locations are better distinguished from stable areas than for coarser resolutions. More gain in model performance could be achieved by adding landslide process complexities and parameter heterogeneity of the catchment.",10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.02.012,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/6651,2013,Geomorphology,0169-555X,Elsevier ,190,,landslide locations; lapsus-ls; new zealand; dem resolution; model performance; climate change,Terrestrial Landscape Change: MARGINS Source-to-Sink New Zealand Programme,73-81

"Food, Nutrition and Agrobiodiversity Under Global Climate Change","Dwivedi, S L; Sahrawat, K L; Upadhyaya, H D; Ortiz, R",ICRISAT(Patancheru),"Available evidence and predictions suggest overall negative effects on agricultural production as a result of climate change, especially when more food is required by a growing population. Information on the effects of global warming on pests and pathogens affecting agricultural crops is limited, though crop–pest models could offer means to predict changes in pest dynamics, and help design sound plant health management practices. Host-plant resistance should continue to receive high priority as global warming may favor emergence of new pest epidemics. There is increased risk, due to climate change, to food and feed contaminated by mycotoxin-producing fungi. Mycotoxin biosynthesis gene-specific microarray is being used to identify food-born fungi and associated mycotoxins, and investigate the influence of environmental parameters and their interactions for control of mycotoxin in food crops. Some crop wild relatives are threatened plant species and efforts should be made for their in situ conservation to ensure evolution of new variants, which may contribute to addressing new challenges to agricultural production. There should be more emphasis on germplasm enhancement to develop intermediate products with specific characteristics to support plant breeding. Abiotic stress response is routinely dissected to component physiological traits. Use of transgene(s) has led to the development of transgenic events, which could provide enhanced adaptation to abiotic stresses that are exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is also associated with declining nutritional quality of food crops. Micronutrient-dense cultivars have been released in selected areas of the developing world, while various nutritionally enhanced lines are in the release pipeline. The high-throughput phenomic platforms are allowing researchers to accurately measure plant growth and development, analyze nutritional traits, and assess response to stresses on large sets of individuals. Analogs for tomorrow’s agriculture offer a virtual natural laboratory to innovate and test technological options to develop climate resilience production systems. Increased use of agrobiodiversity is crucial to coping with adverse impacts of global warming on food and feed production and quality. No one solution will suffice to adapt to climate change and its variability.

Integrating Crop Improvement with Resource Management to Alleviate the Effects of Desertification under Climate Change Scenarios,"Gowda, C L L; Ashok Kumar, A; Janila, P",ICRISAT(Patancheru),"Desertification is one of the major challenges
human society facing today and it is exacerbated
by climate change, and threatens sustenance of
human life on the planet. Desertification refers
to the process of fertile land transforming into
desert, typically as a result of deforestation,
drought or improper/inappropriate
agriculture. Desertification is a serious
problem for the drylands owing to climate
change or anthropological reasons affecting
the agricultural production and sustainability
of ecologies (Geist, 2005). Drylands occupy
approximately 40% of Earth’s land area and
are home to more than 2 billion people. It has
been estimated that nearly 10–20% of drylands
are already degraded, the total area affected
by desertification being between 6 and 12
million square kilometers, that about 1–6% of
the inhabitants of drylands live in desertified
areas, and that a billion people are under threat
from further desertification (Johnson et al., 2006;
World Bank, 2009). Therefore, it is important
to understand the process of desertification,
factors contributing to it and interventions
needed to combat desertification for enhancing

attributes could significantly contribute for improving groundnut productivity and consequently the incomes
of farmers. A groundnut germplasm (268 genotypes) was evaluated in four trials during two years under
intermittent drought and fully irrigated conditions. Drought stress reduced pod yield up to 72 % compared
to 55 % at moderate temperature. The haulm yield decrease due to drought was 34 % at high temperature
and 42 % under moderate temperature. Haulm yield tended to increase under high temperature. Genotype
by environment interaction (GxE) was significant under well-watered (WW) and water stress (WS) treatments.
The genotype and genotype by environment (GGE) biplots analyses revealed several mega environments

Smallholder Farmers’ Perception of the Impacts of Climate Change and Variability on Rain-fed Agricultural Practices in Semi-arid and Sub-humid Regions of Kenya,"Kalungu, J W; Filho, W L; Harris, D",ICRISAT(Patancheru); Hamburg University of Applied Sciences(Hamburg),"Despite the widespread scientific debate concerning the impacts of climate change and variability (CC & V), not much is known about rural farming households’ perceptions of these impacts on their agricultural practices. This is especially so in Africa. In order to address this pressing research need, this study documents those perceptions using data from household interviews at four sites in Kenya selected using a temperature analogue approach. A pair of sites was selected with a semi-arid climate (Katumani and Kambi ya Mawe) and a second pair selected with a sub-humid climate (Kabete and Muguga). Within each pair, sites have similar rainfall totals and patterns but have mean annual temperature differences of between 1.5 and 300C. Thus the warm sites (Kambi ya Mawe and Kabete) are expected to be representative of the cool sites after global warming. Eight agricultural practices that influence productivity were selected for analysis. Significantly, more farmers at the drier sites reported having perceived more changes in the past 30 years than in the past 10 years in nearly all the selected agricultural practices (X² =147.68, Cramér's V=0.52, p<=0.001 df=7 for 30 years and X² =135.95, Cramér's V=0.187, p<=0.021 df=7 for 10 years). In addition, there was a strong association between the perceived changes and the regions (semi-arid and sub-humid) for the last 30 years (X² =147.68, Cramér's V=0.52, p<=0.001 df=7). The study also showed that there was significant association between the observed changes in agricultural practices and household gender (X² =43.51; p <= 0.001). Interestingly, female-headed households observed changes in 62.5% of the selected agricultural practices in all the regions. These perceived changes could be classified as adaptation strategies for the changing climatic conditions.

yield (4-34%) over NTP only in the Rabi seasons. Even though, SRI resulted in higher productivity, the available
nutrient status in soil was marginally higher (10, 42 and 13% over NTP for N, P and K, respectively) at the end of
four seasons. There was a reduction in the incidence of pests in SRI and the relative abundance of plant parasitic
nematodes was low in SRI as compared to the NTP. About 31% and 37% saving in irrigation water was observed
during Kharif and Rabi seasons, respectively in both methods of SRI cultivation over NTP. SRI performed well and

This new concept now dominates current discussions in agricultural development because of its capacity to unite the agendas of the agriculture, development and climate change communities under one brand. In this opinion piece authored by scientists from a variety of international agricultural and climate research communities, we argue that the concept needs to be evaluated critically because the relationship between the three dimensions is poorly understood, such that practically any improved agricultural practice can be considered climate-smart. This lack of clarity may have contributed to the broad appeal of the concept. From the understanding that we must hold ourselves accountable to demonstrably better meet human needs in the short and long term within foreseeable local and planetary limits, we develop a conceptualization of climate-smart agriculture as agriculture that can be shown to bring us closer to safe operating spaces for agricultural and food systems across spatial and temporal scales. Improvements in the management of agricultural systems that bring us significantly closer to safe operating spaces will require transformations in governance and use of our natural resources, underpinned by enabling political, social and economic conditions beyond incremental changes. Establishing scientifically credible indicators and metrics of long-term safe operating spaces in the context of a changing climate and growing social-ecological challenges is critical to creating the societal demand and political will required to motivate deep transformations. Answering questions on how the needed transformational change can be achieved will require actively setting and testing hypotheses to refine and characterize our concepts of safer spaces for social-ecological systems across scales. This effort will demand prioritizing key areas of innovation, such as (1) improved adaptive management and governance of social-ecological systems; (2) development of meaningful and relevant integrated indicators of social-ecological systems; (3) gathering of quality integrated data, information, knowledge and analytical tools for improved models and scenarios in time frames and at scales relevant for decision-making; and (4) establishment of legitimate and empowered science policy dialogues on local to international scales to facilitate decision making informed by metrics and indicators of safe operating spaces.

One approach that has been used to adapt to changing climate is in-field water harvesting for improved crop yields in the semi- arid regions of Zimbabwe. This review analyses the history of soil and water conservation in Zimbabwe, efforts of improving water harvesting in the post independence era, farmer driven innovations, water harvesting technologies from other regions, and future directions of water harvesting in semi arid marginal areas. From this review it was observed that the blanket recommendations that were made on the early conservation method were not suitable for marginal areas as they resulted in increased losses of the much needed water. In the late 1960 and 70s', soil and water conservation efforts was a victim of the political environment and this resulted in poor uptake. Most of the water harvesting innovations which were promoted in the 1990s' and some farmer driven innovations improved crop yields in marginal areas but were poorly taken up by farmers because they are labour intensive as the structures should be made annually. To address the challenges of labour shortages, the use of permanent in-field water harvesting technologies are an option.

It can cause upto 100% yield losses in the susceptible pigeonpea cultivars. Despite earlier investigations on pathological and physiological characteristics of F. udum, the nature of infection process and genetic basis of pathogen variability have not been clearly established. The frequent recurrence of Fusarium wilt and changing scenario of the pathogen in the major pigeonpea growing areas prioritized the research for developing broad spectrum wilt resistant cultivars. The need to study biology of the pathogen, epidemiology of the disease is essential to understand the changing scenario of wilt disease in the context of climate change.

Occurrence of Alternaria alternata causing Alternaria blight in pigeonpea in India,"Sharma, M; Ghosh, R; Pande, S",ICRISAT(Patancheru),Blight symptoms on pigeonpea were observed in alarming proportion since 2009 onwards in Andhra Pradesh state of India. Alternaria blight infected pigeonpea plants were collected from Andhra Pradesh state of India to isolate and characterize the pathogen. The isolate proved pathogenic on pigeonpea cultivar ICPL 87119. Genetic characteristics were analyzed based on the sequence of the rDNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. The phylogenetic tree based on rDNA-ITS analysis showed that the Alternaria alternata causing Alternaria blight in pigeonpea is very distinct from the other Alternaria isolate reported from different host.

Unravelling Effects of Temperature and Soil Moisture Stress Response on Development of Dry Root Rot [Rhizoctonia bataticola (Taub.)] Butler in Chickpea,"Sharma, M; Pande, S",ICRISAT(Patancheru),"Erratic rainfalls and rise in temperature have become more frequent under the changing scenario of climate particularly in semiarid tropics. As a consequence of it, a drastic shift of chickpea diseases have been recorded throughout the major chickpea growing regions in India and elsewhere. Dry root rot (DRR) caused by Rhizoctonia bataticola (Taub.) Butler [Pycnidial stage: Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid] was found as a potentially emerging constraint to chickpea production than wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris). Increasing incidence of DRR indicate strong influence of climate change variables such as temperature and moisture on the development of disease. The present study therefore was conducted to quantify the role of temperature and soil moisture associated with infection, colonization and development of DRR under controlled environment. The DRR incidence was significantly affected by high temperature and soil moisture deficit. Out of five temperature regimes (15?C, 20?C, 25?C, 30?C and 35?C) and four moisture levels (40%, 60%, 80% and 100%), a combination of high temperature (35?C) and soil moisture content (60%) predisposes chickpea to DRR.

Potential for biological nitrification inhibition to reduce nitrification and N2O emissions in pasture crop-livestock systems,"Subbarao, G V; Rao, I M; Nakahara, K; Sahrawat, K L; Ando, Y; Kawashima, T",Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences(Ibaraki); Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical(Cali); ICRISAT(Patancheru),"Agriculture and livestock production systems are two major emitters of greenhouse gases. Methane with a GWP (global warming potential) of 21, and nitrous oxide (N2O) with a GWP of 300, are largely emitted from animal production agriculture, where livestock production is based on pasture and feed grains. The principal biological processes involved in N2O emissions are nitrification and denitrification. Biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) is the natural ability of certain plant species to release nitrification inhibitors from their roots that suppress nitrifier activity, thus reducing soil nitrification and N2O emission. Recent methodological developments (e.g. bioluminescence assay to detect BNIs in plant root systems) have led to significant advances in our ability to quantify and characterize the BNI function. Synthesis and release of BNIs from plants is a highly regulated process triggered by the presence of NH4 + in the rhizosphere, which results in the inhibitor being released precisely where the majority of the soil-nitrifier population resides. Among the tropical pasture grasses, the BNI function is strongest (i.e. BNI capacity) in Brachiaria sp. Some feed-grain crops such as sorghum also have significant BNI capacity present in their root systems. The chemical identity of some of these BNIs has now been established, and their mode of inhibitory action on Nitrosomonas has been characterized. The ability of the BNI function in Brachiaria pastures to suppress N2O emissions and soil nitrification potential has been demonstrated; however, its potential role in controlling N2O emissions in agro-pastoral systems is under investigation. Here we present the current status of our understanding on how the BNI functions in Brachiaria pastures and feed-grain crops such as sorghum can be exploited both genetically and, from a production system's perspective, to develop low-nitrifying and low N2O-emitting production systems that would be economically profitable and ecologically sustainable",10.1017/s1751731113000761,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/7030,2013,Animal,1751-7311,Cambridge University Press,7,s2,biological nitrification inhibition; climate change; global warming; greenhouse gases; nitrous oxide emissions,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), Japan; Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences (JIRCAS), Japan; Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR), Colombia; and Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation (BMZ-GTZ), Germany",322-332
Reducing Vulnerability to Hydro-Meteorological Extremes in Africa A Qualitative Assessment of National Climate Disaster Management Policies: Accounting for Heterogeneity,"Tall, A; Patt, A.G.; Fritz, S",ICRISAT(Bamako),"In Africa, hydro-meteorological disasters (HMDs) have hit with increasing frequency and magnitude in recent years, with detrimental impacts on local livelihoods.

African countries display a patchwork of national policies and institutional frameworks to address these rising HMDs.

This paper examines the heterogeneity that exists within Africa's institutional arrangements for climate-related disaster risk management, and introduces a three-partite policy classification that ranks each country as one of three disaster management policy types: the ‘Unprepared Firefighters’ (whose response to disasters is late, delayed and ineffective), the ‘Prepared Firefighters’ (for the most part effective disaster responders) and the ‘Disaster averters’ (who experienced a paradigm shift and moved focus away from the hazard itself towards a reduction of the underlying risk factors that cause disasters). Through extensive data mining, interviews and qualitative country assessments, we map where African countries lie on this spectrum of effective climate-related disaster risk management.

We find that African countries lay at different levels on the spectrum of effective disaster risk management. Across Africa, countries display differential progress in achieving the Hyogo Framework for Action goals and great variation and heterogeneity exists from country to country, one that calls for a concomitant heterogeneity in aid programs and initiatives meant to support comprehensive disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation (DRR-CCA) in Africa.

In closing, this paper suggests ways to support African countries’ efforts towards effective disaster risk management and planning. It offers a qualitative method to continually assess developing countries’ progress in achieving the Hyogo Framework for Action goals, one that straddles top-down country self-reporting and bottom-up civil society assessment.

"The changes in the effects of temperature and rainfall on cereal crop yields in Sub-Saharan Africa: a country level panel data study,1989 to 2004","Tsusaka, T W; Otsuka, K",ICRISAT(Lilongwe) ,"The harsh agro-climatic endowment is among a host of factors underlying the absence of a Green Revolution in Sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA) since high-yielding agricultural technologies tend to be resource-demanding and thus applicable
only to agro-ecologically favorable production environments. While in Asia some empirical studies indicate that the
climate sensitivity of major cereal crops has begun to be mitigated and there are now both resource-demanding and
resource-efficient types of technologies adopted, in SSA almost no such evidence has empirically been reported to date.
This paper uniquely examines the changes over time in the effects of climatic conditions on cereal crop yields in Sub-
Saharan Africa from 1989 to 2004. Using a 16-year country-wise panel dataset, the yield equations for five major crops
(wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, and millet) are estimated by a combination of two-way fixed effect and sample selection
models. It is found that the temperature effect was mitigated for maize and aggravated for millet, whereas the rainfall
dependency declined for rice and was augmented for wheat and maize. The results suggest that changes in technologies
and other supplementary factors contributed to the changes in agro-climate effects, though the directions of changes are
different for different crops, depending on the type of adopted technologies. In addition, on average during the period
under study, the temperature effects on cereal yields are generally negative while the rainfall effects are positive except

"Simulation analysis of factors affecting sorghum yield at selected sites in eastern and southern Africa, with emphasis on increasing temperatures","Turner, N C; Rao, K P C",ICRISAT(Nairobi),"Global warming is widely predicted to decrease crop yields in tropical, sub-tropical and Mediterranean climatic regions as a result of a speeding up of phenological development and shortening of the time to maturity. We used a well-tested simulation model, APSIM-Sorghum, to evaluate the impact of temperatures +1 °C, +2 °C, +3 °C, +4 °C and +5 °C above current temperatures measured over the past ∼50 years at four sites in eastern and southern Africa, namely, Katumani and Makindu in Kenya, Chitala in Malawi and Beitbridge in Zimbabwe, on the yield, aboveground biomass, transpiration and soil evaporation of short-, medium- and long-duration sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] cultivars given, 0, 20, 40, and 80 kg nitrogen (N) ha−1. When fertilized with 80 kg N ha−1, warming temperatures decreased average yields at Chitala and Beitbridge and yields were unchanged at Makindu and Katumani, but with no added fertilizer average yields increased with increase in temperature at all sites except the hottest and driest site, Beitbridge, where the simulated yields decreased with increasing temperature. Simulation of the changes in soil organic carbon showed that the higher temperatures increased the rate of loss of soil organic carbon and increased nitrogen uptake at all except the driest and hottest site. A micro-dose (20 kg N ha−1) of added nitrogen increased the simulated yields by an average of 19% at Beitbridge, 36% at Makindu, 59% at Katumani and 72% at Chitala, considerably greater than any increase from increased temperatures. The use of longer-duration cultivars and lower or higher populations could not consistently be used to overcome any reductions in yield from warming temperatures. We conclude that low-input, small-holder farmers will not immediately have reduced sorghum yields as a consequence of global warming, but micro-dosing with nitrogen fertilizer will significantly increase yields even in the hottest and driest locations.",10.1016/j.agsy.2013.06.002,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/7031,2013,Agricultural Systems,0308-521X,Elsevier,121,,global warming; simulation modeling; apsim-sorghum; probability distributions; higher inputs; adaptation to climate change,International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics,53-62

Reliable location-specific estimates of yield gaps, either derived from research plots or simulation models, are available only for a limited number of locations and crops due to cost and time required for field studies or for obtaining data on long-term weather, crop rotations and management practices, and soil properties. Given these constraints, we compare global agro-climatic zonation schemes for suitability to up-scale location-specific estimates of Yp and Yw, which are the basis for estimating yield gaps at regional, national, and global scales. Six global climate zonation schemes were evaluated for climatic homogeneity within delineated climate zones (CZs) and coverage of crop area. An efficient CZ scheme should strike an effective balance between zone size and number of zones required to cover a large portion of harvested area of major food crops. Climate heterogeneity was very large in CZ schemes with less than 100 zones. Of the other four schemes, the Global Yield Gap Atlas Extrapolation Domain (GYGA-ED) approach, based on a matrix of three categorical variables (growing degree days, aridity index, temperature seasonality) to delineate CZs for harvested area of all major food crops, achieved reasonable balance between number of CZs to cover 80% of global crop area and climate homogeneity within zones. While CZ schemes derived from two climate-related categorical variables require a similar number of zones to cover 80% of crop area, within-zone heterogeneity is substantially greater than for the GYGA-ED for most weather variables that are sensitive drivers of crop production. Some CZ schemes are crop-specific, which limits utility for up-scaling location-specific evaluation of yield gaps in regions with crop rotations rather than single crop species.",10.1016/j.fcr.2012.11.023,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/6436,2013,Field Crops Research,0378-4290,Elsevier,143,,agroecological zone; climate zone; yield potential; water-limited yield; yield gap; extrapolation domain; global food security; climate change,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,44-55
Phenotyping pearl millet for adaptation to drought,"Vadez, V; Hash, C T; Bidinger, F R; Kholova, J",ICRISAT (Patancheru),"Pearl millet is highly resilient to some of the driest areas of the world, like the Sahel area or fringes of the Thar desert in India. Despite this, there is a wealth of variation in pearl millet genotypes for their adaptation to drought and the object of this paper was to review some related work in the past 25 years to harness these capacities toward the breeding of better adapted cultivars. Work on short duration cultivars has been a major effort. Pearl millet has also some development plasticity thanks to a high tillering ability, which allows compensating for possible drought-related failure of the main culm under intermittent drought. The development of molecular tools for breeding has made great progress in the last 10–15 years and markers, maps, EST libraries, BACs are now available and a number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for different traits, including drought, have been identified. Most of the work on drought has focused on the drought tolerance index (DTI), an index that reflect the genetic differences in drought adaptation that are independent of flowering time and yield potential. The DTI is closely associated to the panicle harvest index (PNHI), a trait that relates to a better grain setting and grain filling capacity. Initial work on the DTI involved empirical breeding and selection based on PNHI. A QTL for PNHI has then been identified and introgressed by marker-assisted backcrossing. More recently, a thorough dissection of that QTL has been carried out and shows that high PNHI is related to the constitutive ability of tolerant lines to save water (lower leaf conductance and sensitivity of transpiration to high vapor pressure deficit) at a vegetative stage and use it for the grain filling period. However, there is no contribution of root traits in this QTL. Current work is taking place to map these water saving traits, understand their genetic interactions, and design ideotypes having specific genetic make-up toward adaptation to specific rainfall environments.",10.3389/fphys.2012.00386,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/10233,2012-10-19,Frontiers in Physiology,1664-042X,Frontiers Media,3,386,pearl millet; human diet; genetics; genomic resources; drought resistance; molecular breeding; phenotyping; qtl; breeding; marker-assisted selection approach; drought; climate change,,1-12

Based on a qualitative survey, it draws attention to the constraints that farming households face, the role of institutions, and the implications for their capacities to adapt. Using an institutional framework, the study examines the role of local institutions in facilitating community adaptation to perceived climate variability. It was found that at the institutional and community level farmers rely on government schemes that provide social safety nets and the private sector such as moneylenders as sources of adaptation options regarding access to credit. Serious constraints emerged, however, in terms of adaptation to what may be a more challenging future. These constraints were further explored by means of grounded theory. The lack of collective feeling and action has hindered bargaining for better market prices and the development of alternate livelihood options. The need for better financial inclusion and access to more formal systems of finance is necessary to increase the overall adaptive capacity of households. During crisis situations or climatic shocks, the absence of these systems means the sale of household assets and resources especially among small and landless groups of farmers. Overall, rural households perceive that public, civic, and private institutions play a significant role in shielding them against the adverse effects of climate variability. The perceived importance of different institutions is, however, different across different categories of farmers, women, and labourers.",10.1007/s11069-012-0417-9,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/6162,2012,Natural Hazards,1573-0840,Springer Netherlands,,,climate change; perceptions; institutions; adaptation; ehaviour adaptation constraints,Asian Development Bank,1-22

summarizes options for plant breeders to enhance the adaptation of pearl millet

gene pool management using broad-based populations and diverse selection
environments is useful to develop new diverse germplasm adapted to specific

Simulation output analyses reveal that crop yield will
decrease due to climate change and variability in drylands,

application of existing knowledge on crop, soil and
water management, and by re-targeting and redeployment
of the existing germplasms of the crops in

Conservation agriculture in the semi-arid tropics: Prospects and problems,"Jat, R A; Wani, S P; Sahrawat, K L",ICRISAT(Patancheru),"Relatively less attention has been paid on the use of conservation agriculture (CA) in the arid and semi-arid tropics (SAT), although a lot of information is available from humid and sub-humid regions globally. The objective of this review is to focus on the use of CA – its status, problems and prospects in the semi-arid tropical regions with emphasis on Asia and Africa. The information on the use of CA in SAT regions is summarized and put in context with the information available and lessons learnt on the use of CA in relatively vast tracts of land, especially in Brazil, North America, and Australia. Clearly, there are several bottlenecks in the use of CA in the SAT regions of Asia and Africa especially under rainfed agriculture. Among the major constraints to the use of CA in these regions include insufficient amounts of residues due to water shortage and degraded nature of soil resource, competing uses of crop residues, resource poor smallholder farmers, and lack of in-depth research in the SAT regions of Africa and to a lesser extent in Asia. The exception in the implementation of CA is of course the wheat–rice system in south Asia under irrigated conditions. The use of CA in the wheat–rice system of the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of south Asia has been relatively well researched during the last decade or so. However, in rainfed systems of the drier regions, relatively less attention has been given to develop research strategy to overcome the constraints to the adoption of CA.

Effect of elevated CO2 and high temperature on seed-set and grain quality of rice,"Madan, P; Jagadish, S V K; Craufurd, P Q; Fitzgerald, M.; Lafarge, T.; Wheeler, T R",IARI(New Delhi); University of Reading(Reading); IRRI(Manila); ICRISAT(Patancheru),"Hybrid vigour may help overcome the negative effects of climate change in rice. A popular rice hybrid (IR75217H), a heat-tolerant check (N22), and a mega-variety (IR64) were tested for tolerance of seed-set and grain quality to high-temperature stress at anthesis at ambient and elevated [CO2]. Under an ambient air temperature of 29 °C (tissue temperature 28.3 °C), elevated [CO2] increased vegetative and reproductive growth, including seed yield in all three genotypes. Seed-set was reduced by high temperature in all three genotypes, with the hybrid and IR64 equally affected and twice as sensitive as the tolerant cultivar N22. No interaction occurred between temperature and [CO2] for seed-set. The hybrid had significantly more anthesed spikelets at all temperatures than IR64 and at 29 °C this resulted in a large yield advantage. At 35 °C (tissue temperature 32.9 °C) the hybrid had a higher seed yield than IR64 due to the higher spikelet number, but at 38 °C (tissue temperature 34–35 °C) there was no yield advantage. Grain gel consistency in the hybrid and IR64 was reduced by high temperatures only at elevated [CO2], while the percentage of broken grains increased from 10% at 29 °C to 35% at 38 °C in the hybrid. It is concluded that seed-set of hybrids is susceptible to short episodes of high temperature during anthesis, but that at intermediate tissue temperatures of 32.9 °C higher spikelet number (yield potential) of the hybrid can compensate to some extent. If the heat tolerance from N22 or other tolerant donors could be transferred into hybrids, yield could be maintained under the higher temperatures predicted with climate change.",10.1093/jxb/ers077,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/6072,2012,Journal of Experimental Botany,0022-0957,Oxford University Press,,,elevated co2; flowering; grain quality; high temperature; rice; spikelet fertility.; climate change,,1-10

Maize (Zea mays L.) was the test crop. Gas samples were measured from undisturbed, cleared and cultivated woodlands using the static chamber methodology involving gas chromatography for ample air analysis.

Inter-disciplinary scientists have been trying to understand and dissect the mechanisms of plant tolerance to drought stress using a variety of approaches; however, success has been limited. Modern genomics and genetic approaches coupled with advances in precise phenotyping and breeding methodologies are expected to more effectively unravel the genes and metabolic pathways that confer drought tolerance in crops. This article discusses the most recent advances in plant physiology for precision phenotyping of drought response, a vital step before implementing the genetic and molecular-physiological strategies to unravel the complex multilayered drought tolerance mechanism and further exploration using molecular breeding approaches for crop improvement. Emphasis has been given to molecular dissection of drought tolerance by QTL or gene discovery through linkage and association mapping, QTL cloning, candidate gene identification, transcriptomics and functional genomics. Molecular breeding approaches such as marker-assisted backcrossing, marker-assisted recurrent selection and genome-wide selection have been suggested to be integrated in crop improvement strategies to develop drought-tolerant cultivars that will enhance food security in the context of a changing and more variable climate.",10.1007/s00122-012-1904-9,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/6006,2012,TAG Theoretical and Applied Genetics,1432-2242,Springer Verlag,125,4,crop physiology; drought tolerance; ,Centre of Excellence (CoE) grant from the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) of Government of India; Theme Leader Discretionary Grant from CGIARGeneration Challenge Programme (GCP); Tropical Legume I Phase II Project of GCP; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,625-645

This paper raises the importance of considering local farmers’ perceptions on climate risk, as this greatly influences on-farm investments and decision-making in agricultural management and production in semiarid Zimbabwe. A study was conducted in two districts of semi-arid Zimbabwe using participatory research techniques, to investigate farmers’ perceptions of climate variability and whether these perceptions correspond with historical climatic data. The study showed that farmers perceived climatic and weather patterns to have changed over the past decade or two, as indicated by erratic rainfall patterns, decreased rainfall and temperature increases, leading to crop productivity decline and increased livestock morbidity and mortality. Majority of respondents (75%; n=81) were highly risk-averse, perceiving that most of the seasons in any ten given years could be poor. The climatic data show no evidence that corroborates the farmers’ perceptions, with only temperature showing a clear signal, indicating the influence of other non-climatic factors. The climate data show rainfall
variability to be a normal characteristic of the study sites, with deviations from the climatic rainfall means (or the poor seasons) being cyclical and occurring once in every three seasons over the past 40 years. The study

It was important for this study to understand farmer perceptions regarding the role of climate risks within a complex and multifarious set of risks to farmers’ livelihoods. This study used both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate farmers’ perceptions regarding threats to livelihoods in southern Zambia and south-western Zimbabwe.

Land-use and land-use change effects on nitrous oxide emissions in the seasonally dry ecosystems of Zimbabwe: A review,"Nyamadzawo, G; Chirinda, N; Mapanda, F; Nyamangara, J; Wuta, M; Nyamugafata, P; Olesen, J E",Bindura University of Science Education(Bindura); University of Zimbabwe(Harare); Aarhus University(Tjele); ICRISAT(Bulawayo),"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas (GHG) with a considerable warming potential and involvement in the destruction of stratospheric ozone. The conversion of savannas to agricultural land has the potential of changing the characteristics and gas exchange of the ecosystems dramatically. The savanna woodlands cover over 95% of Zimbabwe’s forest area, and are divided into five woodland types: Acacia, miombo, mopane, teak (Baikiaea Plurijuga) and Terminalia-Combretaceae. This review is aimed at exploring the effects of land-use changes and land management practices on N2O emissions in Zimbabwe. Available data on N2O emission were collected from standing and deforested miombo woodlands, grasslands and agricultural lands. Estimated mean annual N2O emissions from savanna ecosystems in Zimbabwe were 17.1 Gg N2O, while annual fluxes from arable land (cultivated and fallow) was 3.19 Gg N2O. Biogenic N2O emissions were mainly concentrated in the wet season as N2O production is strongly enhanced by high soil moisture. During the dry season pyrogenic emissions were also important sources of N2O, contributing, an estimated 6.7 Gg N2O annually. Land use change in the form of biomass burning and conversion to grassland or arable land may be considerable source of N2O, whereas current agricultural practices do not seem to provide a large source of N2O in Zimbabwe. Seasonally dry savanna ecosystems, thus, constitute an important source of N2O, which should not be ignored in national and regional estimates of emissions of N2O. Land-use change from savanna to agricultural production results in an immediate increase in N2O emissions. However, the emissions will decrease with time. The current estimates are associated with large uncertainties, thus, there is need for more detailed studies on the effects of land-use change on N2O emissions and on spatial and temporal variations in N2O emissions from the different savanna ecosystems.",http://www.ajol.info/index.php/acsj/article/view/81781,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/6528,2012,African Crop Science Journal,1021-9730,African Crop Science Society,20,s2,greenhouse gases; miombo; mopane; savanna; climate change,,553-564

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of dambo catena position on termite mound distribution and GHG emissions. It was hypothesized that mound density and GHG emissions from Odontotermes transvaalensis mounds, vary with catena position. The evaluated catena positions were margin, mid-slope, lower slope and bottom. Mound density was significantly lower in the bottom when compared to the other catena positions.

Role of calcium carbonate minerals in improving sustainability of degraded cracking clay soils (sodic haplusterts) by improved management: an appraisal of results from the semi-arid zone of india,"Pal, D K; Wani, S P; Sahrawat, K L",ICRISAT(Patancheru),"A long-term heritage experiment (LTHE) following the improved management (IM) system was initiated in 1976 on bench mark Vertisols (Kasireddipalli soils, Sodic Haplusterts with ESP > 5 but < 15 and saturated hydraulic conductivity, sHC < 10 mm hr−1) under semiarid tropics (SAT) environments at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) centre, Patancheru, India for increased productivity. It was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the IM system in combination with appropriate cropping practices can improve soil quality in comparison to the prevailing traditional management (TM) practices. The average grain yield of the IM system over thirty years was five times more than that in the TM system. Adaptation of the IM system improved physical, chemical and biological properties of soils to the extent that Sodic Haplusterts now qualify for Typic Haplusterts. Constant release of higher amount of Ca2+ ions during the dissolution of CaCO3 (8.4 mg/100g soil/year in 1m profile) under the IM system, compared to slower rate of formation of CaCO3 (0.10 mg/100g soil/year in 1m profile), provided soluble Ca2+ ions enough to replace unfavourable Na+ ions on the soil exchange sites. Higher exchangeable Ca/Mg ratio in soils under IM system improved the sHC for better storage and release of soil water during dry spell between rains. Adequate supply of soil water helped in better crop productivity and higher organic carbon (OC) sequestration. The improvement in Vertisols’ sustainability suggests that the IM system is capable of mitigating the adverse effect of climate change, and the sustainability of the Typic Haplusterts may continue for another couple of centuries under SAT environments, and thus stands for its adaptation on a sufficiently large scale through national and international initiatives",http://indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:cr&volume=31&issue=2&article=004,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/6839,2012,Clay Research,0255-7193,The Clay Minerals Society of India,31,2,caco3; improved management; icrisat; vertisols sustainability; sat; climate change; mitigation,,94-108

Variability and Relationships among Forage Yield and Quality Traits in Pearl Millet,"Rai, K N; Blummel, M; Singh, A K; Rao, A S",ICRISAT(Patancheru); ILRI(Patancheru),"Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.], owing to its high photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production ability, fewer disease and insect pest problems, and tolerance to multiple environmental stresses, is a valuable forage crop, especially in view of climate change consequences. Nine open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) and 27 top-cross hybrids made on three male-sterile lines (A-lines) were evaluated in Alfisols at ICRISAT, Patancheru in the rainy season for two years. When harvested at 50 days after sowing, top-cross hybrids out-yielded OPVs, on an average, by about 30%, most likely due to relatively earlier flowering and higher biomass accumulation. At 80 d harvest, the dry forage yield of OPVs was similar to those of the hybrids. Forage nitrogen (N), in vitro digestibility and metabolizable energy content were used as laboratory fodder quality traits. Significant differences among the OPVs and among the hybrids were observed for these three quality traits, both at 50 d and 80 d harvest. While forage N declined by 49% at 80 d harvest, in vitro digestibility and metabolizable energy declined by 16-18%. At 50 d harvest, forage N content, in vitro digestibility and metabolizable energy were all significantly negatively correlated with forage yield both in OPVs and hybrids. At 80 d harvest, forage yield was not associated with any of the three quality traits in OPVs. In hybrids, forage yield was significantly negatively correlated with forage N content, while it was significantly positively correlated with the other two quality traits. These results indicate better prospects of combining high forage yield with high levels of in vitro digestibility and metabolizable energy in hybrids than in OPVs of pearl millet",http://www.globalsciencebooks.info/journalssup/12ejpsb_6_si2.html,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/6576,2012,The European Journal of Plant Science and Biotechnology,,Global Science Books,6,2spl,,,118-124
Evaluation of Genetic Traits for Improving Productivity and Adaptation of Groundnut to Climate Change in India,"Singh, P; Boote, K J; Kumar, U; Srinivas, K; Nigam, S N; Jones, J W",ICRISAT(Patancheru); IFAS(Florida),"Anticipated climate change will alter the temperature and rainfall characteristics of crop growing seasons. This will require genetic improvement of crops for adapting to future climates for higher yields. The CROPGRO model for groundnut was used to evaluate genetic traits of Virginia and Spanish types of groundnut for various climate scenarios of India. The analysis revealed that productivity of groundnut can be increased in current and future climates by adjusting the duration of various life-cycle phases, especially the seed-filling to physiological maturity (SD-PM). Increased maximum leaf photosynthesis rate (AMAX), increased partitioning to reproductive organs (XFRT) and increased individual seed-fill duration (SFDUR) all contributed to the increase in pod yield in all climates. More determinate pod set (shorter PODUR) was beneficial only in the water deficit environments. The positive effect of increasing specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf size (SIZLF) on pod yield was greater in environments more favourable for plant growth. Increasing reproductive tolerance to high temperature by 2 °C increased pod yield of groundnut in warmer environments, especially where the crop often suffers from drought. Increased adaptive partitioning to roots (ATOP) increased drought resistance of groundnut on high water-holding capacity soils. Combination of traits had additive effects and pod yield increased substantially. These results indicate that the CROPGRO model can be used to assess the potential of individual or combination of plant traits for guiding breeding of improved groundnut varieties for current and future climates.",10.1111/j.1439-037x.2012.00522.x,http://oar.icrisat.org/id/eprint/6016,2012,Journal of Agronomy and Crop Science,1439-037x,Wiley-Blackwell,,,climatic factors; crop modelling; cropgro model; genetic improvement; peanut,ICRISAT for providing financial support through USAID linkage fund.,15 p.

Grain yield of these crops is low to moderate in the semi-arid tropics with large variation due to high GxE interaction. In the Indian subcontinent chickpea is grown in the post-rainy winter season on receding soil moisture, and in other countries during the cool and dry post winter or spring seasons. The pigeonpea is sown during rainy season which flowers and matures in post-rainy season. The rainy months are hot and humid with diurnal temperature varying between 25 and 35°C (maximum) and 20 and 25°C (minimum) with an erratic rainfall. The available soil water during post-rainy season is about 200–250 mm which is bare minimum to meet the normal evapotranspiration. Thus occurrence of drought is frequent and at varying degrees. To enhance productivity of these crops cultivars tolerant to drought need to be developed. ICRISAT conserves a large number of accessions of chickpea (>20,000) and pigeonpea (>15,000). However only a small proportion (<1%) has been used in crop improvement programs mainly due to non-availability of reliable information on traits of economic importance. To overcome this, core and mini core collections (10% of core, 1% of entire collection) have been developed. Using the mini core approach, trait-specific donor lines were identified for agronomic, quality, and stress related traits in both crops. Composite collections were developed both in chickpea (3000 accessions) and pigeonpea (1000 accessions), genotyped using SSR markers and genotype based reference sets of 300 accessions selected for each crop.
